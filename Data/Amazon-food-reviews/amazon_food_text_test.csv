"I enjoy many types of tea, the more flavorful the better. I received this in a sampler that I purchased and did not find it to be very good. It has a very oily taste to it. I will finish off the tea bags that came in the box but would not purchase this type again.",2
"I received this Gloria Jean's Hazelnut coffee this weekend; the same brand from the same location I've always gotten it (in fact, its a Subscribe and Save order).  I went to make coffee this morning and almost all the coffee grinds came out of the pod.  I thought it may have been a fluke so I tried 2 more times...both times with the same result.<br />To make sure it wasn't my Keurig I tried a different brand of coffee that I had at home and it worked fine, no coffee grinds at all.<br /><br />I don't know what happened, but this lot of GJ Hazelnut is NOT GOOD!!!",1
"The look of the ham was somewhat dissapointing.  Having eaten Jamon Serrano throughout latin America and Spain... I was not blown away like I was hoping,,, it was OK but only OK.",2
"I was a little disappointed to find that the amount of spice is actually quite small. I find it difficult to figure out size and weighting with spices on line because some of it can depend on packaging.  But with the cut of the spices, you really only get about 1.5 T of spices.  Flavors and blend are otherwise good though I was further disappointed to find that this blend lacks Chervil - something I didn't notice before ordering. Had I seen that, I would have ordered a different mix from another company.",3
I was grabbing some candy to share at the office and picked these up simply because I'd had a request for something that wasn't chocolate. Little did I know that these addictive candies would disappear faster than anything else!,3
I ordered this cherry syrup because I love cherry cokes.  I had gotten some cheap sugar free cherry syrup at Wal-Mart for snow cones and loved it but could no longer get it because it is a seasonal item.  This was expensive with the shipping but it had gotten great reviews.  I am very disappointed.  It has a very medicinal after taste.  I don't normally take the time to write a review but I don't want anyone else to spend nearly $20 with s/h for this. I'm pouring mine out. Try something else.,1
"A pleasant change for the jerky I am used to. Low fat and low carb as well. So its Ostrich, but it does not taste weird like I thought it would. Actually, it tastes similar to beef.",5
I truely love the Mauna Loa Kona Glazed Macadamia nuts and of the four boxes two were very good and the other two were not. Nothings worse than a bad nut and two of the containers had several that were bad. Normally I order these directly from Mauna Loa and I have not experienced these issues.,3
"I received this coffee as a gift from a friend returning from Germany. I instantly fell in love with the smooth and creamy taste.  The price is so much better on Amazon as ONE jar in the German store near Dallas costs more than the 2-jar pack here. And, with Super Saver Shipping...you can't go wrong.  Enjoy :)",5
"This gum is not very minty, and the flavor is gone within a few minutes. I really wouldn't recommend this product. I was looking for something with no Aspartame, but I guess I will have to keep looking.",2
Great seeds everone of them germinated in about a week. I did store the seeds in the icebox about eight weeks before sowing,5
"I was impressed with the Diamanti White Ice Wine kit, but disappointed that it made only 3 gallons or 15 of the 750 ml. bottles, not the 30 bottles stated.  I didn't have a 3 gallon carboy, so I had to purchase one to make the wine.  It's not done yet, but it smells like it will be fabulous when ready!",4
"I like white cheddar.  I can eat half a pound of it at one sitting.  I like soy.  I can chug plain varieties of it by the quart.<br /><br />But 'Just the Cheese Rounds, Cheddar Plus Soy' as a snack?  It's hard to get down one of these calcified nuggets, let alone a portion.<br /><br />As an added bonus, an aftertaste will naturally curb your appetite for hours.",1
"This is convenient coffee to be refrigerated and served while cool or with ice.<br /><br />It is not as flavorful as take-out iced coffee and also contains many chemicals you may not like in a coffee.<br /><br />There are other brands of superior coffee and I'm just not comfortable with all the additives in this brand. Also it is pretty sweet, depending on your taste, you may like or dislike this factor.",3
"Both my cats say ""DO NOT WANT"" when I give them this flavor. They love the Newman's Turkey & Veg though.",2
The idea for this is great! Unfortunately I received three flavors (6-7 count of each) and then three other falors (1 each). I was hoping that they would be more evenly disbursed between the 24.,3
"The coffee is fine.  But, the first box I received was badly damaged, with four of the eight cans having beed crushed open. The reason: pooly packed with no bubble wrap or protection.  I asked for repolacements, which were sent, but again, poorly packed and some cans were damaged. I talked to customer service, who just did not seem to get the fact that they need to pay attention to how they pack and ship.  Otherwise fine.",3
The coffee is excellent and the service was too!  So was the price with the cost of Keurig K-Cups rising weekly.,5
"These favorite chocolate treats are especially good designed as ""flamingo droppings.""  Great tasting, fun packaging. Made a nice gift for caring neighbors.",4
Poor product don't waste your money,2
"Considering this is a calorie free, sugar free, etc free, it is great! I am on the Medi-Fast diet so this products and the entire product line fits in perfectly. Best feature; it tastes very good!",4
"****<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings' Gingerbread Spice is a delightful holiday tea. It contains cinnamon, ginger root, roasted chicory root, roasted barley malt, natural flavors, and luo han guo. Luo han guo is a sweet fruit which is used as a natural sweetener and medicinal herb in China, believed to increase longevity. Gingerbread Spice does not contain caffeine, so it's technically an herbal tea. Because of the roasted chicory root and roasted barley malt, it has a hearty taste. Sort of like gingerbread cookies---really! It is not as sweet as a cookie would be, but it's a delightful taste!<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings has been around a long time, and makes quality teas. All of their teas are free of preservatives and artificial colorings and flavorings, all are certified Kosher and none use irradiated botanicals, which I appreciate. Although they use ""natural flavors"" in their teas, these natural flavors are derived primarily from fruits, spices and herbs, and never contain monosodium glutamate (MSG). They use environmentally conscious packaging and sustainable sourcing. To remove the caffeine from green and black teas, they use a process called ""effervescent decaffeination"" (using carbon dioxide). Celestial Seasonings justifiably takes pride in being a company that makes natural teas.<br /><br />On the package, Celestial Seasonings writes, ""A wonderful way to thaw a frosty chill is to step into a cozy kitchen warmed by the spicy aroma of fresh-baked gingerbread! That cherished old-fashioned recipe flavors our Gingerbread Spice Herb Tea -- a nostalgic medley of ginger, cinnamon and other good-for-you ingredients. Because it's naturally caffeine free, you can indulge in this festive tea anytime. And since merry moments are made to share, pour a steaming cup for friends and family, and toast to the season. Cheers!"" This tea is only barely sweet and spicy but quite full bodied. Each tea bag packs a lot of flavor and I only need to use one at a time.<br /><br />I recommend it, even if it's not a holiday. It's perfect for a cold or wet winter day.<br /><br />****",4
"I would not recommend this product at all. My son ordered it for me for my birthday and so I have to keep it. If it were not for this reason it would go back in a heartbeat. The items in the basket are very small and dollar store at best. The potpourri seems so old it has no scent, the foot pumice stone fell apart the first use, the candle was melted...need I say more..oh...except that they had the gall to charge 60 bucks for it!

"Wisconsin Turkey Snack bites, I'm sorry for the low rating<br /><br />But,<br />I was pretty disappointed.  It might taste good to some, but not me. I've so far had one other brand on amazon, and a few brands in store, and I disliked this one.<br /><br />The snack bites have a few problems.<br /><br />1) They're fairly watery. Not only do they look more ""reconstituted"" than other brands, but their water content seems higher.<br /><br />2) they're lacking flavor.<br /><br />I try to solve problem one and two, by cutting them in half, dosing them in some hotsauce pepper mix, and drying them in the sun [and once in the oven]. This is rather time consuming, sort of. But even then, the oil/protein ratio is higher (meaning more oil) it seems than other turkey snacks.  Which is lame.<br /><br />So, I'll keep looking for good turkey jerky on amazon [which is basically anywhere, since beef is the game in most stores], any suggestions in the comments I'd appreciate. Preferably at a reasonable cost.<br /><br />P.S, of humerus note, I noticed one of the suggested tags are ""Hip Hop"".  Funny.<br /><br />UPDATE: I got a comment that pointed out how this is not turkey jerky, but rather turkey sausage. This invalidates much of my review. I dont remember why I originally expected it to be more like turkey jerky. That said, they still were not tasty..",2
"My dog destroyed the rubber ""cord"" in 5 minutes (worse yet, swallowed it), got very nervous trying to get the treats out and almost attacked my other dog for trying to get it from her (which she never before did). I had to take her toy away and wish i could get my money back. $10 is not a cheap tog toy, so it could be at least durable. I bought it because i thought it'd be a good distraction to keep her entertained and less anxious when i leave, but now i'm afraid it'd be inducing aggression and causing harm if ingested. And that would cost much more... Better stick to Kong toys, the only ones so far my chewing dog cannot destroy it!",1
"These appear to be, on first glance, similar to Nutter Butters.  On taste, however, they are lighter, more delicate, and infused with hazelnut.  There is more air in the cookie, so when you dip it in coffee, it becomes saturated rather quickly and the cookie folds into your mouth, with the sweet center taking center stage.  Nuff said.",5
"I bought this for a road trip with my kids.  The taste is very good but the beef is ""moist"".  It doesn't have the same texture of most jerky.  If you avoid jerky because it is hard to eat, this would be great for you.  If you enjoy the flavor of the dried meat and the chewey texture of jerky, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU.",3
"My hair dresser's salon bought a Keurig Machine, so I have been able to sample a variety of K-Cups. K-cups are about 10 times more expensive than a regularly brewed cup of coffee so I have never considered buying one for myself, but having a Keurig Machine at a hair salon makes sense! People have a variety of tastes and K-Cups can provide a nice variety and freshly made one at that.<br /><br />The salon has a nice variety of K-cups: Folders, Wolfgang Puck, Timothy's, and Green Mountain (that owns Keurig).<br /><br />Everyone's taste vary, but here is my assessment of the ones that I have tried so far. Wolfgang Puck was my second favorite. So far, I like Folgers the best.<br /><br />FOLGERS GOURMET<br />SELECTIONS LIVELY COLOMBIAN<br />Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 36 for $25)<br />Earthy flavor, fruity and nutty flavors come through.<br /><br />WOLFGANG PUCK CHEFS RESERVE COLOMBIAN DARK ROAST<br />Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 48 for $32.98)<br />A dark roast with caramel and earthy notes, slight burnt<br />and papery flavors.<br /><br />TIMOTHY'S DECAFFEINATED COLOMBIAN MEDIUM<br />Price per cup: 60 cents (package of 50 for $30)<br />A bit on the weak side, kind of papery, and less astringent than the others.<br /><br />Ali Julia review",3
My 13 yr old min pin suddenly stopped eating her regular brand food.She went many days not eating  so i switched to this brand and she went BESERK FOR IT.I now buy it from Amazon because it's a little cheaper and i don't have to hassle running back and forth to the pet store wasting my gas and paying more.This is a highly rated pet food without the BY-PRODUCTS store bought dog food has.My little girl seems to be more active since i've been feeding her this brand and I feel better knowing she is getting better nutrition.....,5
"I am personally a big fan of tea. I have been drinking tea ever since a kid. That said, I am also someone who doesn't like to add sugars to my tea as I think it takes the taste away. I enjoyed this green tea as it has a little bit of extra in there. To me, it almost tastes a little bit grassy. Now, that might not be something you might enjoy but the taste was something that I enjoyed.<br /><br />My husband also loved the tea and he is someone who likes to put sugars and honey into his tea. He actually didn't put any extras in this when enjoying the tea. This is going to be a preference thing where some will like it and others don't. For me, I enjoyed the tea quite a bit.",4
"This coffee is good, and because it is organic, it is worth the price. It's got a nice, round flavor but could stand to be a little more robust. The pods of course are ultra convenient, but I would quibble with the fact that the individual pouches do NOT have a notch in them for easy opening. I have to cut each pouch with a pair of scissors.",4
This product is something that both of my dogs refuse to take after loving earlier version. Quality has changed for the worse. Agree with what Basted noted earlier. Do not buy this product.,1
"Could be stronger.  Needs extra scoop for proper strength.  However, this is a good price though and overall this coffee is not bad.",3
"Just FYI, for those that don't prefer coconut like me, these Almond and Apricot bars are LOADED with coconut. It is the 2nd ingredient. You can taste the apricot, as a subtle aftertaste, but other than that, it might as well not be in the bar. The coconut pieces linger in your mouth, so carry a toothbrush close-by.",2
"My 10 month old Golden Doodle had chewed through the rope within 30 minutes.  The ""bottle"" part is hard plastic and very loud when bounced around.  The knot on the rope (when we still had a rope) fit too tightly into the opening making getting treats out of the bottle close to impossible.  I had hoped this would be one of those toys to occupy her a bit more.  And for the price, think the rope would have been somewhat tougher to a chewer like mine.<br />If your dog is a chewer I can't recommend this.  Not what I expected or hoped for.....",2
"Since I serve lunch, there's no time or space for a sandwich. I've been looking for something I can drink for lunch, but everything I encountered included unsavory ingredients and/or had a terrible taste. Orgain is one of the more expensive protein drinks but it's worth it. I don't get tired of the creamy vanilla bean flavor and the chocolate tastes like a frothy glass of chocolate milk. It fills me up without making me sluggish and is also a great boost when you need some fuel for working out.",5
"This honey is smooth and tasty. It feels like it is less sweet than the average honey. Not much aroma. But the real ""problem"" with this honey is that it disappears way too fast. I need to buy bigger jars...",5
"My 3 yr old Daughter luvs the taste of these ever since her first one at 1yr old!  I luv the ease of use, organic, minimal processed ingredients.  They are worth every cent!",5
"The kids loved these, and they are so easy to just put in their bag for a school snack.",4
"Went to Save Mart tonight and happened to go down the health isle where they have specialty items and saw these. I bought two, the Honey Dijon and the Creamy Bacon. I taste tested them when I got home and found that the Honey Dijon tasted ok for a milisecond, lol and then found that it had a bad after taste....If you're going to pay the price go with the Creamy Bacon, yumz yumz, good luck!!!",1
"I LOVE these things. I can get them cheaper at my local store so I don't buy them here on Amazon, BUT I wanted to review the product because it is excellent, particularly for someone like me who worries about getting enough protein and vitamins/minerals.<br /><br />I'm a college student, so I don't eat a whole lot of meat, because a) Its expensive, b) I often don't have enough time to cook it, c) I worry about not cooking it properly and getting some icky food-born illness.<br /><br />So, the majority of my protein comes from dairy products- quick and easy to consume, and relatively cheap. But on their own I still worry its not enough protein, so these things are great! You just pour a package into your glass of milk, stir it up, and enjoy! A high-protein, vitamin rich, delicious snack or mini meal!<br /><br />The vanilla flavor really is very, very tasty. I highly recommend.<br /><br />The ONLY cons I can think of are:<br />1) Added sugar to an already sweet drink, has something like 18g per serving?<br />2) Can be hard to find and/or expensive (on a student budget, anyway)<br /><br />But the pros much outweigh the cons for me. I drink one or two of these everyday and love them. They're great added to smoothies to bump up the nutrition value!",4
"If you're on a low-carb diet, this is probably for you. It bakes nicely in a bread machine, but there isn't a lot of rise to it. It tastes great toasted and I like using it for grilled sandwiches.",4
"The taste is alright.  I love vanilla chai tea and I thought I would try this.  I added a lot of cream to it after it brewed and then it was more to my liking.  Next time I'm considering adding a drop of vanilla extract, I have a feeling that will do the trick.",3
"Normally, I don't even look at chocolate milk flavorings for milk, but happened to be in that aisle.  Spotting my old friend Ovaltine, I was looking forward to some nostalgia.  I am a senior citizen, so that was a long time ago.  The Chocolate Malt was my guess for being closest to the original I remember.  The carb content looked pretty low at 9g even though sugar is listed first, and only 40 calories is low for a treat.  Unfortunately, I failed to see soy in the ingredient listing at the store.  I am one of those people who get a lingering metallic aftertaste from the smallest amount of any derivative of soy.  I'm so disappointed!",1
"I ordered a whole box of 6 cans of the cereal. When I opened the first  one,  only a little more than half of the can is filled with the cereal. Well, I thought I got a lemon. I opened another can, surprise, the similar half full amount. It turned out all 6 cans were just like that. Why would they use such a big can when they only fill half of it?  Although I like the ingredient, I will never buy the brand again. It's not the way to do a honest business. So I am not going to trust its listed nutrition.",1
"I thought that (1)package of cocoa was enough to receive a good chocolate taste, and the marshmallows gave an additional sweetness, for a nice cup of hot cocoa.",4
"You can get the same Tea at most of the Asian Groceries at around 7 dollars. The tea is good, but at $18, its a rip off.",3
"I just purchased a bag of this Vitality Chicken Breast dog jerky product from a large national retailer today (I liked the natural, wholesome ingredients), and was VERY concerned and upset when I read that is is made in China. Given the many unecessary and unethical pet deaths that occured fairly recently due to melamine and other toxic ingredients in Chinese made pet products, my concern is quite legitimate and justifiable. You just don't know if you can trust any pet products from China anymore. And here I thought that I finally found a good, heatlhy, wholesome pet treat for my dog. I had to throw out the bag. Bummer.",1
"As product lines go, Newman's is tough to beat. Organic, all natural, and money goes to charity. What's not to like?<br /><br />For this product, however, it's a swing and a foul ball. It's not a miss. The 50+% cacao stands out, with rich dark chocolate flavor similar to other bars. However, the mouthfeel and texture of this bar is all wrong. It's not creamy in the way chocolate should be, instead it leaves a thick coating on the inside of the mouth that is both unpleasant and ruins the flavor. I'm not certain what it is, but perhaps the type of fat or the fat content they used doesn't mesh with the chocolate bar. I found it rather unenjoyable to eat the entire thing.",3
"This is a very effective item that extends the life of a bottle of wine.  Unlike others that I've used, the subtle clicking noise lets you know when all of the air has been removed and the bottle is again ""sealed.""",5
"I did a little research about these candies because I was invited to try them free. On their website you're able to compare a bag of Peanut M&M's, their #54's, and an Orange.. (or compare regular M&M's to the #41's in this review, and fruit). I was glad to see the list that they don't use partially hydrogenated oils (Trans Fats)...which I strictly ban in our house (but so do most candies nowadays, Corn Syrup is not a big priority for me as I don't consume much of it (and candy is a rare treat), ....GMOs (i'm not sure if the M&M's do (the side by side comparison should have shown us what they were up against. What I didn't like was that they failed to mention the saturated fat (which is at least around 3-4 grams...), AND the threw fresh fruit into the comparison. Why are you comparing candy and fresh fruit? This makes consumers think that your product is ""Healthy"" when in fact it is still candy, and should still be enjoyed in moderation, like all sweets that are heavy in fats, saturated fats, and sugars.<br /><br />Also, the #41 candy mentioned was 8 grams less per bag, which makes up for some of the lower amount in calories per bag, among other things. I'm glad to see the lower amount of overall sugar, which is a plus. But really, as someone who has struggled with weight all their life, this is still candy, not health-food. Moderation is key, regardless of GMO's, or high-fructose corn syrups.<br /><br />As a taste test, my husband and I decided to start with the #54's first. Ultimately these became our favorite. But we only each had a couple pieces and decided to call it quits. The #41's were fine. We just didn't feel like the candy was worth finishing. And we didn't finish it. This candy might satisfy someones sweet tooth, but if i'm looking for a sweet treat, I know plenty of other things worth the splurge!<br /><br />Please, please, please Unreal, stop comparing your candy to fresh fruit!! :)",2
The flavor was so gross that we couldn't even give this away if we tried. I did end up donating the boxes of this because it is such a foul flavor. The only way to even make it bearable was the Cinnabon creamer. This is an ambitious flavor that was not achieved.,1
Leaves are easy to be broken and slipped out of strainer. fresh enough.<br />tastes good enough. not so storng.,3
"These tastes like normal m&m's.  I can't taste any coconut in them.  I wish there was real flakes of coconut inside.  I was expecting something like the center of a mounds bar inside, but instead just tastes like bigger regular m&m's.  Still tastes good, but not coconut as advertised.",1
"If I could rate these with less than one star I would.  My dogs LOVED them, I gave them one each.  The next day they turned out to be gut bombs, diarrhea with chunks of sweet potato in them - in the kitchen, everywhere.  Blech.  I'm returning them ASAP.",1
"We opened the box to find the jelly beans sitting directly in the box.  No bag, no plastic container (as the description states)...just literally a cardboard box full of jelly beans.  How clean are cardboard shipping boxes?  The box was taped on top to seal it but air, bugs could easily get through the unsealed edges.  The jelly beans were good and still tasted fresh but we were very disappointed in the packaging.",2
great added to your morning coffee!  Doesn't add all the sugar like the regular hot cocoa mix!  Moca low cal,5
"this is my first time trying guar gum... and i realized that im not too crazy about it...it gives sauses strange consistency and taste, i will use traditional cornstarch instead",3
The taste is not horrible but it is not very good. There is not a very good mango flavor. I would not buy again.,2
"This product is made by Annie's Inc. in Berkely, CA--made in the USA.  The product maintains excellent organic integrity, and it is stored in 100% recycled paperboard packaging.<br /><br />The manufacturers also support family farms - use organic milk, butter, and yogurt.  The product takes approximately 10 min. to prepare.  The product contains dairy and wheat, and it has been exposed to equipment that also processes egg and soy products.<br /><br />The ingredients include organic whole wheat shell pasta, organic valley organic cheddar cheese (organic cultured pasteurized milk, salt, non-animal enzymes), organic whey, salt, and sodium phosphate.<br /><br />This is a mildly flavored whole wheat macaroni & cheese dinner.  This mac and cheese is a wonderful comfort food.  The pasta is firm, and it has an excellent flavor.<br /><br />There are no artificial flavors, synthetics colors, or preservatives.  The pasta was produced without antibiotics, synthetic hormones, or persistent pesticides.<br /><br />This pasta is simple to make and it has a wonderful texture.

To add that wonderful rich smooth cheese flavor that accompanies mac and cheese, you will have to add your own organic cheese.<br /><br />The cheese packet falls flat on flavor and it does not contain a sufficient amount to coat the pasta.  I give this mac and cheese a 5/5 on packaging, 5/5 for maintain organic integrity, 5/5 on texture, and a 2/5 for flavor.",3
"Couldn't get my little guy to eat this one at all.  One sniff and he walked away!  Couldn't believe that one - he goes mad for Friskies tukey and cheese but all these fancy feast varieties in turkey he just cannot stand.  Can't figure this one out.  However, I do recommend it because of its high nutritional value.  Hope you have better success than I did!",2
"Like all the other reviewers, I find this is a virtually inedible mess. Apparently it used to be a good product, but they changed it, no doubt to save a few bucks. And aren't they committing some kind of fraud when the box says prominently ""100% REAL POTATOES""  - which I why I tried it - and then the ingredients list Mono and Diglycerides, Sodium Acid Pyrophosphate,Sodium Bisulfite and Citric Acid.<br />No matter what small percent these things may be (they don't give figures) then the product is NOT 100% potatoes.<br /><br />Sheesh.",1

"Mangos -- the number one fruit in the world -- are an integral part of Indian food.  Personally, I have deeloped a tolerance for really hot foods.  On a scale from one to ten, I'd put these at about a two or three.<br /><br />This mango relish is not mango chutney (which is a totally different product).  This relish has nice chunks of mango and most people can tolerate the moderate heat.  This is the relish I serve to guests.  Like most Indian relishes, chutneys and pickles, it doesn't take too much.  One jar is probably about 30 servings so do the math: six jars is 180 servings.",4
"According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats.",1
"I was looking forward to tasting the Switch Orange Tangerine drink since orange and tangerine flavors are two of my favorite but I was disappointed in the result.<br /><br />It was tangy. It tasted of ascorbic acid. It smelled of orange candy. It reminded me of breakfast. It reminded me of, yes, powdered Tang mixed with carbonated water followed by a strong unpleasant artificial aftertaste.  I found the the drink to be, simply, not very good.<br /><br />I tried to like the beverage and I did appreciate the concept but considering the unusual flavors, high calorie count of 140 cals/8.5 oz, and cost of almost a dollar/serving -- I cannot recommend Switch.",2
kind bar satisfy's the chocolate craving and also has antioxidants.  Great as a breakfast bar and also tastes good.  My kids like it too.,4
This tea is weak at best when compared to other rose hip teas I have tried. The bags have no string and tag. The bags are the limpest and often fall apart while squeezing. The only brand of tea I have ever had do this. I drink 4 to six cups of tea a day of various types and this is a very lame tea.,1
"If my wife's pug could talk, he'd say: ""Delicious! Almost as good as the people food they slip me occasionally. It's the only dog food I'll eat, aside from the Mighty Dog Chicken, Egg & Bacon Dinner.""",5
I just received these curry leaves and they were rotten! I am appalled at how a company can ship such an item to a customer.,1
"In a word,  HORRIBLE.  This stuff no more tastes like Apples then do my hiking shoes.  This stuff is nasty, it has a sweet chemical-like taste that is just yucky.  Can I say anymore about how I dislike the taste of this overpriced product?  How anyone could buy this stuff more than once is beyond me.",1
"I was looking for a nice clear broth soup for lunch coming off of the master cleanse. I found these packets in my pantry at home. There are quite a few ingredients to be called a clear broth soup! Why add wheat and wheat gluten??? and  monosodium glutamate? Now I have to look up succinic acid, sodium citrate, disodium inosinate, and disodium guanylate. Looks like alot of sugar and salt. You can do better than this Kikkoman.  hmmm. Guess I will wait until I get home to have my home made veggie broth soup.",1
I use this to sweeten my coffee. Much better than artificial sweetners. I also use it for baking. The low gylcemic index is a big plus.,5
I've ordered the Dubble Bubble Gum Party Box twice and both times they sent me Bazooka Gum which I don't like. Do you think they'd do any thing about it after numerous calls - NOT! Amazon needs to stop carrying them with their poor customer service and can't seem to send the customer what they ordered.,1
"I could not get K cup to fit machine. I wrote to Amazon to get seller address and sent email to K cup seller. My email was sent and I NEVER heard from the seller.  I waited and waited but no response.<br />Amazon sent me a copy of the email.<br />I think this seller is irresponsible.  As it turns out,my computerize, electronically bright daughter was able to fit the K cup holder into the Keurig.<br />But.... I never heard back from the seller.<br />Amazon, this customer is NOT satisfied with service. I am disappointed inI. You as well as this seller.<br />I will never buy from this seller due to their poor customer service.<br />K cup, item is fine.  Company is horrible.",1
"This is an excellent coffee but unlike Amazon's usual great service whoever they use to fulfill the coffee orders is terrible.  I ordered several boxes of this coffee from Amazon but they were shipped to me just thrown in a box.  Anywhere from one-quarter to one-half of the cups were damaged and unusable.  Worse yet Amazon won't take a return since it is a food item.<br /><br />In summary, buy this coffee, just not from Amazon.",1
These are really good and they don't taste like diet food at all!  My kids love them in their lunchbox.,5
"This particular Auntie Chun's has 20 grams of fat, 5 grams of which are saturated fat.<br /><br />This is not much healthier than Nissan fried Ramen.<br /><br />Simply Asian noodles have 1 gram of fat!  One gram per whole serving!  And the servings are the same size, and the taste is just as vibrant and lovely as this Auntie Chuns.  I, personally, won't be buying Auntie CHun's again, and wanted others interested in nutrition to notice this startling difference.<br /><br />Quality of product and taste is same, essentially, Auntie CHuns and Simply Asian.  I get the Teriyaki noodles or the Pad Thai Simply Asian.<br /><br />Healthy living to you all!",3
"I received this babyfood maker as a baby shower gift and I was so excited to use it! I have used it for about two weeks and everything seemed fine. It pretty much did the job, except for you can only do a small amount at one time so it can take all day to make a week's worth of food. It is hard to clean also. It retains the color of whatever you are making even if you wash it right away. I was willing to deal with this, but I thought there had to be a better way. After using it and washing it today, I noticed about 4 hairline fractures on the inside of the gray plastic. I can't use it now. I plan on returning it and using a regular steamer and food processer. NOT worth the hundred dollars!!! Please save your money. This thing is not worth it.",1
"Chips weren't crisp - and not as good as I remembered<br />don't think I will order again, but  - They were packaged<br />very well.",3
"We love these!  We are weeding regular plastic out of our lives as much as humanly possible and these really fit he bill.  Only issue we have is if we don't change the bag often enough when these is wet/ veggie material in the bag it will start to decompose in the can and may tear/ leak when we pull it out.  This is generally not an issue as we fill the can up fairly quick - but sometimes we forget to take out the trash before we leave town for vacation or camping a few days.  Wish they were just a tad thicker for puncture resistance, but that isn't a problem too often either.",4
I didn't think this was possible but it is. That's all you can taste too. There's a little heat at the end but that isn't enough to make this a worthwhile product sorry.,1
"Some people will extol this product, some will dislike it, while others will see some good and some bad points in it. The good are the healthy ingredients: the 5g fiber, 750mg Omega 3, and the five 100% whole grains. Nutritionists have said that if a product states that it is whole grain, it is not 100% unless it explicitly says so. Other people may dwell on what they consider bad points. The problem with 100% whole grains is that many individuals find them tasting too grainy. This is the case here. It is one of the reasons why some manufacturers do not use 100% whole grains. Secondly, the clusters remain hard even after sitting in milk or soy for several minutes. This may be too hard for some consumers. Thirdly, the cereal is filled with flax seeds, which is good, but they do not soften, and they get caught in some people's teeth.",4
I love this chicken glaze..its the best.  I have eaten in many restaurants and only one or two of them meet the quality of this General Tso's glaze sauce.  I use it faithfully now and sometimes use it to make very delicious sesame chicken too.  I give high praise to this fine Iron Chef product.,5
"It says almond blend, but it doesn't smell any almond, maybe there is only 0.00001% of the almond in the ingredients. It's pretty much rice powder, if you are OK to pay the price for rice powder, it's the choice. very disappointed.",1
I bought these to put my puppies vitamins in and he just doesn't like them!,2
"This is my first time trying Pacific Foods soups and maybe my last time.  I could not believe somebody would make this soup, package it and then sell it.  This soup is not consumable, and what makes it worse, it smells bad.  Honestly, I think dog food smells better.  I really do not think a dog would eat it either.  I put it in the fridge thinking I could come back to it and try it again - I could not do it.  I think the garbage disposer chocked on it also!  If I could give this soup a zero, I surely would.  Keep your money in your pocket.  Wolfgang Puck has much better organic soups.  I should have read the one review before I wasted [...] on this crap!  I am going to stick with their line of broths.",1
"The coffee itself is good, not great.  However, what they do not tell you is that you only get 18 k kups for your $10.",2
Do your research of the ingredients before you buy this for your dog to eat. Would you feel safe about feeding this to your dogs I wouldn't. Just cause it has a fancy packaging doesn't mean that it's any good.,1
I was disappointed because these cherries are so dry there are tough. I buy a mixture from qvc that is so moist therefore I am disappointed in these cherries/,2
I personally didn't like it at all. The tapioca pearls are all crumbled and are practically impossible to prepare. The drink tastes awful to me. The straws are fine... Wouldn't recommend.,1
"I have been a tea drinker forever and Bigelow makes a nice tea.  This is a smooth, fruity raspberry flavor.  I consider this a dessert tea and generally drink a fruity tea in the evening instead of having dessert.  One bag (in my opinion) will generally make more than one cup tea.  I use one bag for 24 oz of water.  This would also make a nice glass of ice tea.<br /><br />May I suggest adding honey, agave cactus juice, or unbleached sugar (all available in food stores), if you require a sweetener.",5
"The tuna was not as ""Chunk"" or dense as I perfer.  The tuna is packed with way more water than I would expect, which makes draining difficult.  The lemon pepper was sweet rather than acidy and spicey.  This was unlike other brands lemon pepper that I enjoy, especially when making sandwiches.",1
These were surprisingly tasty. My kids loved them too and they are a great on the go snack. They offer a quick pick me up and aren't too messy in the car when on the go.,4
"Maybe you can call me a Ramen expert..<br /><br />I recommend this ramen if you want to experience a Japanese ramen. It will taste OK for a couple of times, but you will be easily fed up with it. The soup base is too weak and naive. Yea, Japanese ramen is good but what I mean by that is the real ramen you can get in Japan.<br /><br />As to instant ramens, Korean ones are much better.",2
"I have tried this flavor every way possible.  Cream, cream w/sugar, black w/sugar, black, small, medium, large, made with the B40 machine at work, made with the B70 machine at my house...  Every way tasted bad.  I like a lot of different flavored coffees and flavored k-cups, I don't know why this tastes so bad.",2
"I adore licorice and pomegranate so I had high hopes for this... especially since Newman's Own is such a great brand. For me, the licorice just wasn't up to par, especially considering the price. The taste is low key (which I was expecting), but the texture was somewhat greasy/waxy, which was a huge surprise. There was also a bitter aftertaste, which to my friend (who loves black licorice) liked enough to give this candy at C+... but for me the texture ruined it completely. I love the concept, I just hope they continue working on the texture in the future.<br /><br />The packaging, I have to say, is pretty awesome.",2
"I was so very disappointed when these dates came in. They were the worst dates I have ever had--hard as a rock.  I was shocked and in disbelief.  The dates came from Hadley, which I thought was a reputable company. I would think they would be ashamed to send out such a poor product. Boy, was I ever wrong.  I will NOT order these ever again. Please heed this review when ordering dates and buy them elsewhere.",1
"I bought this for use in my Bunn pod brewer, and since I am unable to buy these pods at the local supermarket, I took a chance at buying a 54 unit package without having tasted the product before.  Just opening the pouch releases a pleasant and sweet aroma.  This coffee is light and balanced, with low acidity.  I quickly went through the first 18 count box.",4
"After a recommendation from my personal trainer, I tried Larabars for the first time.  She gave me a bar to try and I was hooked immediately.  I especially like the Cherry Pie flavor, but have also enjoyed all the other yummy flavors that I've sampled.  These bars are healthy, delicious,and ""habit-forming.""  What a convenient snack to carry!",5
"This coffee was ok, but it didn't have enough 'kick' for me. I think I was trying to equate this Sumatra blend to Starbuck's Sumatra. The Starbucks version is much more hearty than this one<br /><br />To be fair, this Smatra blend is billed as a 'medium' strength and it is that.",3
"337 has a deep, rich flavor with a bit of sweetness not typical of a cab.  Taste is beautifully balanced with a nice long finish.  I recommend letting it breathe for an hour or so as the flavor changes (for the better) with a bit of a wait.",4
I bought this for my husband.  I use an ecobrew with Starbucks!  He didn't like it and it is sitting in our cabinet as a backup in case we run out of doughnut shop!,3
"I ripped open one of the bags and popped a few pieces into my mouth, and was appalled at how they tasted. They were not what I remembered! I cracked open one of the pieces to find that the peanut inside had white spots on it, which may or may not have been mold. I looked for an expiration date and instead found a code: 2167CX. After some research I found that the first digit indicates the year of production. I was horrified. This candy was made in 2002! Steer clear of Farley's and Sathers candy on this site unless you like 9+ year old candy!",1
I love Tazo Decaf Chai with almond milk. It's great with vanilla or chocolate almond milk. Rice milk isn't great.,5
"These are really good!!!  Also, be sure to try the Cherry Blossom flavor if you can - that one tastes absolutely wonderful!!  This doesn't stick to your teeth at all and it has a very pleasant taste and even smell to it.  One pack has just enough pieces.  Great to bring along when you're traveling.  I gave some to a 7yr old and she loved it!  Because it's not too sweet (none of that dreaded corn syrup in here), people of all ages would easily approve of this - I certainly do and would not hesitate to recommend this to everyone!",5
"In the past I've enjoyed drinks with Aloe Vera. And I love green tea, so I had high hopes for this drink.  The taste is ok, though the bits of passion fruit make give it a texture that is rather slimy. That combined with the fact a one cup serving has 80 calories, makes this a drink I would have to pass up.  This might not be a problem for green tea drinkers that are not worried about calories, but they might be turned off by the bits of passion fruit floating around in the drink.  Also the price is a bit prohibitive.  It works out to $2.08 per bottle, which seems a bit much for an 11.5 oz drink.",2
"Annie's Deluxe macaroni and cheese comes with a pouch of cheese sauce, which tastes better than any dry powder variety and it is quicker to mix.  Regardless of how thoroughly I mix the cheese powder, milk and butter, the dry powder varieties do not taste as good as Annie's Deluxe.  Our 3 year old really enjoys Annie's Deluxe and I feel better offering her this rather than Kraft macaroni and cheese.  Even if the taste wasn't as good as Kraft, I would choose Annie's since the ingredients are natural and some are organic.  Kraft uses artificial color in their dry powder macaroni and cheese, though I don't think they do in their deluxe version.  Kids (and adults) don't need artificial colors!<br /><br />I would give Annie's Deluxe a 5 if they would reduce the sodium content and make a Deluxe version that included whole wheat pasta  and was ALL organic (currently only some of the dry powder versions are all organic).  And while I am creating my dream version, I would give Annie's a 10 if they would enrich it with some calcium and other vitamins and make a whole wheat bunny shape version! :)  My big hangup is that the sodium is too high (like all the other brands).  It would still taste great with a lot less salt (if kids are not given high sodium in the first place, their taste buds don't crave it).  Unless pasta is whole wheat (or other whole grain), there isn't much nutrition in it, so whole wheat pasta that is enriched is the way to go!  Annie's  offers many varieties that include some of the improvements I am  looking for, but it would be great if they would include them all in one version.<br /><br />Boxed macaroni and cheese is truly junk food no matter who the manufacturer, but Annie's is doing great things to make it better.  Knowing that macaroni and cheese is often ""kid food""  is reason enough to improve it nutritionally.<br /><br />The price is reasonable on Amazon and at WalMart, however most of the grocery chains and Wholefoods charge too much!  The best price I found was at Annie's home website when they offered 25% off and free shipping.",4
"I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!",3
"When I bought this, I didn't realize the noodles are different from Ramyun spicy picante.  Ramyun is the thinner yellow noodle and neoguri is the thicker white japanese udon noodle.  Unlike the kimchi flavor, this has enough spices to satisfy your craving and since I do not dislike udon noodles, I give it 4 stars.  But it is not as good as Ramyun picante and I give ramyun 5 stars.  My boyfriend is german / irish American and he loves these noodles...even this spicy neoguri.  I believe the fishy smell would be for the seafood flavoring.  This is for a 30 pack/case and there is a 20 pack/case which may be cheaper.  So if you still aren't sure, try a pack before you buy a case.",4
I can't necessarily blame the product but my dog sniffed this and wouldn't even pick it up.  Looks like I'll be donating the other box I bought to his dog friends in the hopes that they will eat it.,1
"didn't think there different spags would have different tastes...just love this one...used to get it at whole foods, but they never seem to keep enough in stock..so I ordered a s**** load..yum",5
"Amazon sells four Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe dinners. They're all pretty good. Each uses packets of cheese sauce, not packets of powder, so the cheese is never clumpy and distributes itself evenly. My husband, teenage daughter and I cooked up all four and did our own taste test. Here's what we found:<br /><br />The Original Cheddar flavor (Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe Dinner, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)) is good. Plenty creamy, it tastes like a homemade version of the Kraft standard (i.e., <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVRK"">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Scooby Doo Shapes, 5.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a>).<br /><br />This one, the Sharp Cheddar flavor, is slightly tastier, and has a subtle smoky aftertaste.<br /><br />The light meal (Kraft Deluxe Macaroni & Cheese Dinner - Light, 14 oz) is pretty good, but when you try it side-by-side with the original flavor you can tell it's not as rich. Still, if you only buy this one you'll be happy. If you're counting calories go for it.<br /><br />The Four Cheese meal (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1FZ4Q"">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe Dinner, Four Cheese Sauce, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>) is, in our opinion, the best. With the most cheese flavor, it combines American, cheddar, colby and parmesan, and tastes similar to what you'd find at a decent restaurant. The parmesan flavor is especially noticeable.<br /><br />These Deluxe dinners cost about twice as much as the basic Kraft boxes, but in each case you can really taste the difference.",4
"Watching my calorie intake, I love this product.  No calories which is a huge plus.  I knew the taste wouldn't be as big as the full calorie, full fat peanut butters.  I tried this in a PB&J, tasted just fine to me.  Now if only a local store would carry this product instead of having to order online.",4
"Although low carb taco shells are a great idea in theory, these shells are just to thin to hold anything and get soggy before you even have time to fill two.  I have one box left that I am wondering what to do with.",1
"The tortuga rum cakes are the most delicious cakes I've had, but was disgusted with what amazon delivered. I don't know if it was old stock, but the cakes had been robbed of their moistness. Cannot express my disappointment and shame, since they were gifts to my friends. Amazon should be careful when it comes to food to ensure its fresh.",1
"I very seldom prepare a soup from dry mix without additions, and this is no exception.  I diced a large onion, and about 6"" length of cajun sausage,  and sauteed them lightly before adding the water. Once the water was boiling and the mix was stirred in and beginning to thicken I added 8 ounces of tomato sauce, about 1/3 pound raw shrimp without shells (from my freezer), and 1/2 cup extra raw rice.  Popped on the lid and let it simmer for the recommended time, and it was a very good result. Hubby, who is VERY sensitive to salt content, did not have any criticism of ""too salty"".  If you like a semi-instant soup I would give this a very good recommendation.",4
"I received this order very promptly. However it says med blend and I received about 10 decaf and 10 bold and extra bold which I have to force myself to drink. Also all the cups are not air right and I have had 4 explode grounds everywhere when i make a cup  of coffee, which are a pain to clean out of my machine. do not buy. I could have gotten a better deal paying full price and I dont want to drink defected cup which these are.",2
"It seems that this Yumberry Blackcurrat tea may have replaced the Wild Blackcurrent tea.  The Yumberry Blackcurrant is good, bur not as flavorful or have the bold fruity taste of the Wild Blackcurrant.",3
"Just FYI:<br />Real Simple Magazine rated Partanna ""The Best Olive Oil for Drizzling""<br /><br />This is our absolute favorite EVOO.  We discovered it when eating at Serious Pie, an awesome Tom Douglas restaurant in Seattle.  While sitting in the restaurant, we noticed huge tins of Partanna in the kitchen.  Of course, if Tom Douglas (who is a cooking genius) uses Partanna, than we are all for it!!!  (My fiance and I are HUGE fans of his restaurants, if you can't notice.)  Anyway, we ordered our first tin a couple months ago, and have been reordering it from Amazon ever since.  The 1L tin will last about 3 months, depending on how much you use it.  We used it for cooking and dipping bread into.  It's the most delicious EVOO out there.  Throw out your old EVOO bottles, kids, because you've hit the best of the best.  It's buttery, extremely rich, and healthy for you.",5
"these cookies are a favorite of mine.  crisp, with just the right amount of ginger.  I don't know what the other comment is talkin about not havin enough ginger, my mouth gets very tingly when I eat them, and I think I like a lot of spice.",5
"I eat dried mango almost everyday and have tried so many different brands, but this brand is the worst. I almost thought it was spoiled, but every 1 of the 6 packs tasted the same. Mushy and overly sweet. I had to check the package to make sure sugar wasn't added. I would definitely try a different brand!",1
I noticed no difference in the amount of hulls...very large pieces of hull and very small pieces of popcorn. Tastes very good but not hulless....won't buy again,2
"I had a craving for a reuben and am too poor to go to a restaurant. I've never bought this before because sauerkraut in a can seemed gross and perhaps too cheap to be any good. The jarred and bagged brands at my local grocery were too big and too expensive, so I took a chance on this. It turned out just fine for my purposes and I will surely buy it again. It seemed a little more sour than other brands I've tried (but I could be wrong - I only buy it every few years). It seemed maybe a little less crispy, but it wasn't too soggy or anything. I was pleasantly surprised by this product.",3
"I wish I had a bit more to say about this product.  I used both this and the shampoo of the same line.  As a result, and with apology, my reviews for these products will be very similar.<br /><br />The scent of the conditioner is fine (it smells like the shampoo).  It's neither particularly outstanding nor is it bad.  The scent, such as it is, is not very long lasting.  I did find that the conditioner wasn't quite as ""weightless"" as I expected.  It seemed to take a bit longer than normal to get all the conditioner out of my hair.<br /><br />After using it, I didn't notice any particular change in my hair.  It didn't seem stronger or shinier.  It's possible that I could see improvements with repeated use.<br /><br />It simply seems to be a fine, basic conditioner and seems mild enough for everyday use.",3
"This chocolate is delicious and so smooth, and there's ample hazelnuts for every bite.  Word of caution: once you start eating, the entire bar disappears!",5

I have always been partial to a chocolate combo with caramel.<br />Ghirardelli makes a good product and the individual wee bars are nice. I put mine in the fridge at this time of the year. Great price today (when I bought)<br /><br />Cadbury has a bar called Caramilk. The chocolate is excellent but the caramel not my favourite.,5
"What happened to the original silver colored Pike Place Roast coffee?  My recent orders in my account has been replaced by Medium Pike Place Roast which I never ordered?  And all the reviews prior to this review of mine belonged to that original Pike Place Roast, not the medium one...This is not right.",1
"I bought these as a treat for my dog and he started vomiting about an hour later.  I thought it was something specific to that dog but when I tried giving them to my other two dogs- they both got sick too.  I think they eat them like a treat rather than chewing on them and then they block their digestive tract.  Whatever is going on, I wouldn't purchase them unless you don't mind dog vomit.",1
"The size and consistency of the grind was really quite good.  The level of the saltiness was as expected.<br />The dispensing mechanism worked well and its adjustability made it easy to control the sprinkle of the product. The size of the package was perfect for a small household to use at table. The only negative was the placement of the bar code sticker which completely covered the ingredient and nutrition information.  SO, there is no way to know the actual sodium content or other additives. Think this was a sloppy placement of the Amazon product code sticker.",5
"I've been using Fromm Surf N Turf in my rotation (which has come down to this and the beef frittata veg by Fromm) over the last several months.<br />First, I have an itchy/scratchy bichon.  Surpringly she does not have food allergies, but environmental allergies.  She gets better and worse, depending on the season.  Her coat is nice, skin, stool, all good.<br /><br />Next I have a sensitive tummy Portuguese Water dog who cannot have any grain AT ALL.  Surf N Turf is perfect and she digests it well.  I've tried several other foods and she just cannot handle foods with grain in it, not even the 'easy to digest' rice formulas.<br /><br />Even my little chihuahua, Cookie, does great on it.  Beautiful, soft and full coat, nice teeth, breath, stool and overall health.<br /><br />I do feed this as 70% of their overall diet, the other 30% being from The Honest Kitchen (Zeal and Love formulas).<br /><br />This is a food I've happily recommended!  And I don't see myself feeding anything else. Pleased with the customer service as well!",5
"If you like pineapple flavor in smoothies. snow cones, mixed drinks, this is the stuff you are looking for. Great natural taste. Not quite yellow color.  Brownish yellow color,like real pineapple.  Pour out some in a glass, add a little water and yellow food dye and you have perfect yellow pinapple smoothie.  This stuff is concentrated and  potent.  A liitle amount is all that you will need for the flavor.Very sweet and high calories.",4

"This black tea from Hong Kong is infused with a nice natural mango aroma and flavor. The reason I didn't give it five stars is that the tea itself has a slight earthy flavor (some people like it, but I'm not a fan). Overall, this one's a keeper.",4
"I bought these Arizona Green Tea packets because I wanted an easy way to get in my glasses of water everyday.  These packets make it easy, all right, and it tastes great!  Personally, I use more water than it says to in each drink, because it's a little sweet.  I'm really glad I tried these out!",5
"I didn't buy this off of Amazon, I got it from a chinese grocery store for about $6.  I went for dim sum with my family and my mom ordered chrysanthemum tea and it was really good.  I bought this so that I would be able to enjoy the tea at home instead of having to go out to a restaurant just to enjoy the tea.  The tea I had at dim sum was pretty much all flowers and made a greenish yellow tea.  The Golden Dragon tea is >90% dried greenish/brownish leaves and &lt;10% of flowers making a dark brown tea.  This doesn't taste the same as the other tea.  It's not bad but if you're looking for a chrysanthemum tea, look for one that is all flowers.",3
"This coffee is a great alternative for someone who has acid reflux and ulcer problems.  The low acid allows me to still have my caffine for the day.  Maybe not as smooth tasting as my usual blend, but I'm so thankful for it.  Really close in taste.",4
"First package was dropped off in the rain and got soaked through. The company promptly resent another.<br />This is so much cheaper than buying it in the supermarket. I love the flavor and for me it tastes really good on Ribeye steak with a pinch of salt on each side before using the seasoning.<br />I also use it on chicken, it's mild but very tasty.",5
"I grew up on Haribo products from Germany.  This version of Haribo Tropifrutti is pretty good but doesn't taste quite the same, seems a bit more artificially flavored tasting.  They aren't bad and I'll eventually finish them, but I won't buy these again.",3
"At 18.4 cents/bag, this is a very expensive tea.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4MYLS"">Stash Premium Double Bergamot Earl Grey Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box</a> is 13.8 cents/bag (100 bags), <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG1O6M"">Bigelow Earl Grey Tea, 40-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> is 13.1 cents/bag (240 bags), and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5QI"">Twinings Earl Grey Tea, Tea Bags, 50-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> is only 10.8 cents/bag (300 bags).  Other quantities are also available but the price/bag tends to be small compared to the company cost differential.  Is the quality worth the cost difference?  No.  I drink my tea straight up--no sugar, no milk, no lemon (except when iced).  This tea has far less flavor than say Twinings--it's thin even without adding sugar or milk.  I tried steeping it an extra long time too but that didn't help.  The Bergamot is less compelling, and the tea taste is almost absent.  I cannot recommend this product.",2
"I could not believe the shipping on this tiny candy, but thinking that they were as large or larger than the image on the screen, and since they were perfect for my event theme, I bit the bullet and ordered 8 tins.  The shipping came to almost $25.  When they arrived, the box that held these tiny tins (1 1/2 by 2 inches at most and 3/8 inch deep) was about 4x5 inches. To top it off, the only tin I've opened is short 2 candies and 2 are broken.  These are a rip off.  There should be a shipping discount for ordering multiple tins.  The candies themselves are so tiny and the taste is nothing special.... Look elsewhere if you need candy bees.",1

"We have purchased this item several times in the past and it was always shipped in insulated boxes and delivered over night from a company called Christmas Central on the East Coast. We ordered this time again expecting the same efficiency. The shipment of four pounds of Polish Sausage came in three separate cartons-none of them insulated, the ""frozen"" gel-packs (all of three of them) were melted and warm to the touch and even the sausage itself did not feet cold to the touch. It was  delivered to its destination by the regular post man who stuffed the sausage along with daily meal into the mail box. Your West Coast provider Otto's Imports,  simply said that they had done everything they could do short of delivering the sausage in person. They are obviously ill prepared for this type of deliveries. We still haven't decided whether to chance eating this sausage or simply throwing it away.",1
When we discovered our son had food allergies we put him on this formula right away and it worked.  His colic symptoms disappeared in 2 weeks and he began to gain wieght.  I gave it 4 stars because it is so pricey.,4
"Great tasting curry, superb deal by the 4-pack, but far too salty.  Impossible to use with, say, canned tuna or anything else that's pre-salted.  Too salty to cook for a really intense curry flavor.  p.s. I'm *anything* but salt-averse in my cooking generally.<br /><br />If this curry came with about 33% of the salt & allowed me to use more per dish & then salt to my liking, I would buy it by the ton.",3
this was delicious coffee for a great price which i could not find at any store in my area or areas nearby,5
"I was excited to try these noodles.  I love Tai food and these Singapore noodles strongly resembled glass noodles used in Taiwanese cooking.  That is something to keep in mind, considering that these are packaged as Vermicelli (which is another word for Angel Hair) and it is far more reminiscent of glass noodles.<br /><br />When cooking this product I found immediate detractors, and upon eating it I found immediate plusses.  It's kind of a mixed bag that could easily be tweaked to a perfected product.<br /><br />Cooking this Brown Rice Vermicelli is a bit difficult.  The main problem is that the packaging instructions are vague and don't really help you much.  Soaking this product for a minute doesn't do anything.  Soaking it for five minutes also doesn't really do anything.  It takes much longer to soften.  I eventually had to just take it out of the water and toss it in the frying pan in order to get it to soften.  The noodles have a hard time separating from one another and so it gets clumpy and you have to work with it a lot in order to get it apart, which causes many of the noodles to break.  Eventually, they do get to that required texture and you're ready to eat.  The first thing I noticed when eating this product is that it absorbs flavor really well.  Some pastas retain their starchy flavor even after mixing in with a sauce or vegetables, but this product soaked in rich flavors with ease and maintained those flavors.  The texture, once softened, is quite wonderful.  While the package states that there are only about three servings here, there is more than enough to eat once it is cooked up.  We have a family of four, and we all ate till we were full and had leftovers (granted, we made a meat to go along with our pasta, but most people do).<br /><br />So, despite some cooking issues, this is a tasty product.  It is also quite healthy.  Not only is this product Gluten, Fat and Cholesterol free, but the entire package is only about 600 calories.  I will mention price, which can always be an issue.  You're looking at a little over $2 a package if you purchase it at this site.  That is obviously more expensive than your usual box of pasta.  Even whole grain spaghetti (which is what we usually buy) is slightly less expensive (still in the $1+ area), but at the end of the day, $2 isn't a whole lot to spend on a tasty product that can feed your whole family.<br /><br />This is a product that requires a simple preparation.  Heavy handed sauces would overwhelm these tiny noodles.  Some vegetables, oil and herbs will do the trick; which is also a favor to your wallet.<br /><br />If the package instructions were clearer and more informative, I'd give this a higher rating, but cooking should never be a frustration.  At least the eating is very good!",4
"Our Bichon has a very sensitive stomach, so this is the only dog food we buy for her.  When we moved to another state, we had difficulty finding a retailer that carried this particular brand of dog food.  Ordering from Amazon.com makes it easy, and it is delivered to our door within a few days.",5
"I order two (2) cases of cookies on the same Amazon order. A case of Ginger Snaps and case of Chocolate Cookies from another manufacture.  Both cases arrived quickly from Amazon.  But the ginger snaps had many bags where nearly the entire bag of cookies were broken up and in pieces.  The other case of cookies (Chocolate Chip) was perfect, Hardly any of them broken.",3
"Item was packaged well, and seems to be of good quality, based on my limited knowledge of vanilla beans.  Though I love pure vanilla extract, I'm new to using the whole bean.  I withheld one star just because the flavor, when using the entire bean (skin included), had a subtle ""grassy"" taste.  This may be normal, or due to my inexperience and/or improper preparation of the bean, but I thought I correctly followed the directions I had read elsewhere.  Regardless, I'm happy with this product.  They certainly smell incredible, and will make your storage area smell delightful.",4
"I'm a big fan of nutrition bars as a convenient snack or meal substitute in a pinch and this bar is delicious! This was my first thinkThin bar and I found it interesting for a few reasons. The bar is enrobed by a thin layer of what looks like white chocolate. The bar itself is chewy, soft and possesses a cake-like texture which I enjoyed. It had the right amount of sweetness for me and the flavor profile is quite simple and straightforward; nothing spicy or tricky. The only thing I disliked about the bar was the slightly synthetic-tasting white chocolate flavor, but it was not so terrible that I wouldn't eat it again. I would definitely be interested in trying out the other flavors when I get a chance.",4
"I mixed the pouch sent by Amazon.com with water and the taste was cringe-worthy. These days everyone keeps talking about the wonders of both acai and pomegranate as antioxidants that are supposed to be the second coming. They might be or not, but for now I am def. focusing on antioxidants, but this product IS NOT the way to get yout daily doze (unless you have no taste bubs). Truly awful",1
"I love chai teas and was anxious to se how it compared to what you would find freshly made on your own or even from a restaurant.  I did it a few ways so you can see the different results.<br /><br />Iced tea maker with a medium brew - this made a good light tea that showed off the cloves that are in this blend.I added a light cream and once with a milk to it to make a thai type iced tea but the milk quickly overpowered it at the lighter brew.  But as an iced chai everyone loved it and we went through numerous bags before I stopped them so we could test the other ways.<br /><br />Iced tea maker with strong brew - this was much better for an iced Thai type and the cloves were stronger and held flavor when adding milk or cream.  Keep in mind the manufacturer says Assam which is there but the spices are stronger.<br /><br />Hot water light brew - just ok.  I did it once and didn't like it.  Simple enough in explanation I think.<br /><br />Hot water strong brew - this was by far the best result of the four showing off the care they did in individual packaging. While not fresh, it was great for home, blended well with the milk and held up enough as a chai.<br /><br />I wish there was more Assam strength but I was quite happy and will buy this type again.  I recommend hot strong brew, iced strong and iced medium brews for the best results.",4
"As with a lot of older people, my 85 year old mother tends to skip breakfast and since she takes several medications, I thought she should have something to eat with the meds. She lives in MO, I live in TX so I can't run over to take her breakfast.  I have ordered Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies and had them sent to her a couple of times.  She has enjoyed all of them.  I have to eat gluten free so I have not personally tasted them but she says all of the flavors I have sent were very good.  They make a great ""gift"" for her - once you are that age, there is very little that you need as a gift for an occasion, birthday, Mother's Day, Christmas, etc. - I have found that giving her something edible makes way more sense than giving her something that will just clutter up her house.",4
"Not only is this really good saffron at a price far lower than I'm accustomed to paying, but it's also packaged well, in cute little acrylic boxes that make it easy to share with others (as well as keeping it fresh until I'm ready to use it).  I'm looking forward to buying some to slip into Christmas stockings this year - my family members love to give and get fancy foods and ingredients for cooking, and I know they'll be thrilled with this.",5
"I enjoy a rich, robust cup of coffee, this coffee fits the ticket if you like the same.  AFter reading the reviews, I decdied to try it.  It seemed to be priced well in comparison to other Italian Roasts out there. I will say though that it must be packed full of caffene.  I can only drink one cup of this stuff, it gets me pretty wound up.",3
"These Kashi bars are some of the very few you can buy that are not coated in chocolate.  They are chewy and take longer to eat therefore making them satisfying.  They are loaded with protein, fiber and not too much sugar.",5
"First of all- I am not a sophisticated coffee connoisseur.<br /><br />I actually think that McDonald's coffee is far more drinkable than Starbuck's burnt rubbish.<br /><br />Anyway, as far as K-Cups, I used to buy ""Timothys"" and it met my needs.<br /><br />But when I tried Tully's Italian blend for first time today, wow!!- this is very appealing and is so easy to drink. Just the right strength and kick.<br /><br />I noticed that the lids on the k-cups I received today (May 7th) from Tully bulged out quite a bit - clearly they have packed a lot of N2 in these cups. Expiry date is Dec 2010.<br /><br />I recall Timothy's cups do not bulge out as much - but I did not check how far those were from expiry dates.<br /><br />I do not know if the ""bulge"" out factor impacts coffee taste or freshness but perhaps it helps if you plan to store the K-cups for a long time.",5
I like to make a quick salad using these tiny canned shrimps but the cans of shrimp I got were overcooked and tough.  I have bought this product many times before at my local grocery store but this was the first time that the shrimps were actually tough and hard like they had been cooked for too long.  Normally I would recommend these tiny canned shrimps but if Crown Prince has changed it's preparation for some reason......I can not say that I would recommend these any longer.,3
"I gave this a try, as I love bacon.  I usually use the crumbled real bacon to put in salads, eggs, sandwiches...<br /><br />So although I am not a big fan of mayonnaise, I figured if it made my sandwich taste like I had a couple of strips of bacon, well that would be really great !<br /><br />The spread tastes like a very salty mayonnaise with smoke flavoring added. Not really like bacon.  I tried it on a sandwich and most of what I could taste was the salt, MSG and a little smoke flavor.  Fake bacon bits sprinkled on the sandwich would have been a better choice.",2
"This review is for the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Strong Lengths Nourishing Shampoo & Conditioner, written after using these products for seven days.<br /><br />I should start by saying that I consider this an inexpensive product. The shampoo and conditioners I am used to cost 3 to 4 as much as these. Because of this, I didn't expect any improvement in the condition of my already very healthy hair after using these products. While I wouldn't consider the condition of my hair improved after seven days of using these products, I was pleased that the condition of my hair was pretty much maintained. Despite my hair feeling okay after using these products, I won't be giving up my usual products. I like to mix it up with my shampoo & conditioner, so I will continue to use these occasionally, but not every day. One of the main things I'm not crazy about with these products is the fragrance. It's not that they don't smell good; they smell okay. Not my favorite scent, but it's fine. The issue is more that I don't feel like the scent stays with my hair. I don't wear perfume and rarely use any kind of body fragrance, so it's important to me that my shampoo/conditioner leaves my hair smelling nice. I don't get that with this product.",3
"Liked the product but a pretty cheezy promotion. They make you think you're going to get free shipping if you double your order, then when you're down to finalizing your ""check out"" you find out they won't let you double your order because they want to charge you for shipping!",3
"I used to buy this and the green curry paste and loved it. The last batch I purchased is very bland - I used more than half a jar for a two-person serving, and it wasn't very spicy at all. I am sorry that I bought four jars of each flavor - now I'll have to find someone who doesn't know what Thai food is supposed to taste like and give it to them.",2
"I was kind of skeptical, but I really do like this powdered version. The pineapple taste is nice and, in the right amount of water, it dissolves completely. Not as good as fresh, but portable and tasty. I am curious to try the plain version. I'll always keep some on hand for a quick electrolyte boost, especially when traveling. Try it!",4
"My grandkids, who eat everything in sight, took one taste of this and won't eat it.  Still well within expiration date but tastes old.",1
"When I first got them he gulped them down, but the ziplock on them doesn't work that well and at a dosage of only one or two treats a day like the bag says they have gotten kind of dried out and he doesn't like them as much anymore.  I also have not noticed any real improvement in the stiffness of his gait.",3
"Very bitter!  I couldn't taste the coffee at all.  It basically tastes like baking cocoa.  No sweetness, no richness, not coffee.  I bought the 4 pack though, so I've begun mixing it half and half with Swiss Miss (in the can), and then sprinkling it with instant coffee after I've made a cup.  Even making it with whole milk couldn't make this yummy by itself.  If you like a rich chocolate taste with just a bit of coffee.... shop elsewhere.",2
"Since I love chocolate, I was anxious to try this coffee.  It smells great but the taste is rather weak, and it certainly does not taste like chocolate.  I am not going to buy it again.",3
"Never having had M&aacute;te tea I had no idea what to expect. I found it made my stomach a little upset, but my husband drinks a couple of cups every morning. It has a very earthy taste, and we've tried a variety of ways of preparing this tea. Our favorite is to pour very hot (not boiling) water over 4-5 level teaspoons in a large french press. We then let it steep overnight. It doesn't get bitter, and after reading that in South America people just add a teaspoon or so of leaves every day to their already steeped tea leaves, we tried that as well. It works fine both ways, either with making it fresh daily or adding a bit of leaves and steeping again with some more leaves added.<br /><br />It is very good served over ice with a packet of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ"">Stevita Stevia Supreme 50/Box from Stevita</a>.",4
This is the first of many Mrs. May's products we've bought and eaten over the past 5 years that everyone in our family disliked.  I personally found it too sweet and nobody liked the flavor at all.  Very disappointed with this flavor from such a normally tasty line.,2

"Ok- I read the reviews and wasn't sure if I should buy 12 lbs of popcorn. We just like to eat it a few times a week. I have to say, I'm usually a butter lover when it comes to popcorn. But, not with this. No butter is needed with these tasty kernels! The kernels are very white when they pop and small so they have a great mouth feel. All of them popped and the crunch was tender, yet crisp. All I did was toss on a little popcorn salt and I'm not sure it even needed that. I've never had popcorn so good! This is worth a try!",5
"These were good, but I really couldn't taste the A1 in them.  Tasted similar to the original steak nuggets to me",4

"I just got a bread machine not long ago and wanted to get a pre-made mix so I could test it out and get the hang of it before trying any concoctions of my own. I wanted something simple and straightforward. This was a very good choice. You just add some oil and water, and it produces a pretty tasty and healthy loaf.<br /><br />It was slightly on the bland side, so I made some alterations for my second loaf. I added a bit of sugar and some flax seed, and the second loaf was awesome. I love it.<br /><br />I'm very happy with the purchase and would certainly recommend this product. It gives you a good starting point and you can alter it as you see fit.",4
This is the first time I tried Sea Salt & Vinegar chips. Not my taste.  Make sure you like salt & vinegar before ordering. You may be in for a suprise if you have never tried them before.  I'll stick with the salt and black pepper chips.,3
"Upon opening the package, the two young Jack Russell Terriers began bouncing up and down --they could tell from the smell that this was a treat they were going to like.  I was not at all off put by the vaguely minty, grainy smell but my wife did not care for the smell at all.  The two youngsters ran to their crates where they immediately devoured the chews in less than 2 minutes.  The treats were also given to a geriatric JRT, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and an Australian Cattle Dog.  The old JRT also polished his chew off in a matter of minutes, it took the CKCS about 10 minutes and the ACD turned her nose up at the chew -- she literally pushed it into a corner of her crate and sat in the opposite corner as far away as possible from the treat.  The ACD is admittedly very picky about food and treats, but she absolutely loves bully sticks (as do all of the other dogs) which also last many times longer than these chews and cost less when one considers their staying power.<br /><br />In summary:<br />+4: Number of dogs liked<br />+0: Smell (some humans and dogs liked, others didn't)<br />-1: Cost<br />-1: Duration<br /><br />So, these chews get a score of two (2) given that all dogs in the house love bully sticks which provide much longer chewing enjoyment  at a lower cost.",2
"Yuck. Really, the initial taste isn't bad, but overall I couldn't take more than one sip. I tried mixing it with everything, but the health benefits just aren't worth gagging over.",1
very fresh every time i order it an it goes to my daughters house in ca they love it.,5
"It is a very tasty treat I enjoy with my afternoon coffee. However, all good things must be had in moderation, and hence I will only buy one pack at a time from the local store.<br />However the price on Amazon is competitive.<br /><br />I don't know why it was tagged as ""not vegetarian"" because I don't see any questionable ingredient on the list - perhaps someone else can elaborate.<br /><br />The dark chocolate filling has a nice creamy texture without being overwhelming; and nor is it cloyingly sweet.<br /><br />Overall all, I definitely recommend this product.",4
"Tried this on my bird feeder and watched the results. Sprayed heavily on the approach to the feed, up the pole on which the feeder was suspended, on the feeder itself, on the sunflower seeds and on the suet blocks. The squirrels appeared 15 minutes later and behaved as if it was not there. Went out an reapplied a heavier layer. After 20 minutes the suet was gone.  I returned this product and do not recommend.",1
"On 9/9/2011 I order the above product.  My daughter and I recently started the Atkins diet, heard wonderful things about it and decided to give it a try.  The first jar was wonderful!  Creamy, aromatic, flavorful...absolutely devine.  I opened the second jar at the beginning of this week and what a disappointment.  I'm not sure if the ingredients are cooked but the oil has a burnt horrid taste to it.  Before we realized it, we had made a batch of carb-free chocolate candy with cream cheese and coconut frosting, a huge batch of chicken fried in the oil and a huge batch of faux-potatoes using the oil.  We had to throw everything away.  The taste was atrocious.  Everything had a burnt and bitter taste to it.  I'm extremely disappointed and according to my 15 year old daughter, they need to hire better quality control employees.<br /><br />I have to post an update to this review because I've been working with a customer service rep today and he has provided fantastic service.  He is shipping me, for free, a replacement product as well as some additional free products.  I am also sending the remaining jar back to the company, at no cost to me, for additional research.",3

"I just don't like this. The scent is supposed to be subtle, but it's overpowering to me and neither manly nor pleasant. It seems to do a well enough job cleaning and rinsing off, but that can be said of just about any body wash product (or soap for that matter). I'm not really liking it for washing my face either (I use a different Dove product for that) as it really doesn't seem to get deep into the pores. My skin feels about the same. I'll finish this bottle, but this won't make me quit buying Old Spice...it does what it's supposed to do, but I can't get past the smell...it's just not for me.",2

"I honestly think I've been through the entire world's selection of dry cat foods.  The winner?  Purina Pro Plan's Salmon formula.  That's wolfed down entirely and no teeth marks in them either.  This stuff, however, he desperately tried to eat but could not because of the huge size of the kibble.  Now, I have had dog food that had a smaller kibble than this stuff has - but he really wanted to eat it so being the dedicated cat person that I am, I smashed a few of them and hand-fed them to him.  The guy just gobbled them up!  He just loves the flavor, but I can't buy it unless I take stock in Sears - all those hammers I'll have to go through just to break it up small enough for him.  Looks like this one gets to go back to the store as well. If you have a hefty 20 pound Tom cat like I had, then give this a try.  If not, try Pro Plan.",3

"These do not taste like banana's and are an odd pink shade. I'm sure it's difficult to preserve pureed banana, but citric acid (predominantly found in citrus and berries) makes this food less than ideal to introduce to an infant.

"As coffee in general, this Wolfgang variety was alright. However, I was expecting a ""Creme Caramel"" taste, or something similar, and I don't feel this delivered. I tried multiple cups at different cup sizes and this coffee just didn't do it for me. It is marketed as a flavored coffee, yet I could not taste anything beyond the flavor of coffee.",1
"I'm not one of those guys that likes fresh lemon in my ice water, to me it tastes like watered down lemonade but many people I know like the slight hint of lemon. This fruit punch is a bit stronger then the watered down lemon taste, but it's not that much stronger. It does turn your drink red, it does have a bit of a taste but frankly it's not enough of a taste for me to go for it. I would rather drink plain water then this flavoring.<br /><br />Other reasons why I don't like it, the bottle is pretty large, and once you open it you need to keep it refrigerated. This means I can't leave it in my desk at work and pop it in my water bottles as I open a new one. That eliminates the convenience factor. If I am going to refrigerate it I might as well make a full pitcher of a drink.<br /><br />The flavor, size of this and lack of portability due to the need to refrigerate this means I won't be using it anymore. There are a number of other products that don't require the refrigeration, are smaller and have a stronger taste and I'll stick with those.",3
"Hi and thank you for the chance to review the weefuls batter mix.<br />First- I do not like it. I am not pleased with it at all. The mix was very hard to work with. Accordinging to the instructions on how to mix the batter it came out too thick. I even thinned the batter, and still on three different occasions, I attempted to make crepes and they fell apart or tore in two trying to flip them. Even when I tryed taking them off the crepe maker. I tryed the skillet method and the same thing happened. The batter needs something..?  This is a product I will not buy again. I still have the apple cinnamon weeful mix unused and un-opened.

"I LOVE Fit Fruit and Veggie wash!!!<br /><br />I tried another F&V cleaner but it left a scent and taste of the solution on the food.  So I moved on to another F&V wash ---Fit.<br /><br />I immediately fell in love with Fit.  It cleaned the wax off apples so well that they squeaked, so I knew any oils from peoples fingers, dust and dirt had to have been removed also.  (COOL!)<br /><br />Fit did NOT leave a scent or taste on the fruits and vegetables.  Just left the produce clean so the scent and flavor of the produce could be appreciated.  I ended up eating more fresh fruit and vegetables.<br /><br />I've been using Fit for several years now.<br /><br />Sadly, I haven't been able to locate it in my local stores for some time now.  I've talked with my local stores and the company that makes it and told them how disappointed I was that Fit isn't in their stores and how much I loved this product.<br /><br />I was thrilled to find it for purchase here on Amazon (COOL).

Guess you're kind of stuck when you don't have any decent ethnic food stores in the area that carries a good selection of products like this.  The price on this was really good (just over $7.00 for 24-oz bottle) but they charged $6.60 to ship it.  It doesn't weigh that much.,3

First off, I blame myself b/c I should have noticed how many ounces I was really ordering but I didn't and soon wound up with an overload of Goji's! As soon as I opened the bag the odd aroma seeped out and it was less than pleasant. I was expecting an acidic or sweet aroma but out came an earthy, scent. The scent was tolerable compared to the taste! The taste is awful and leaves a bitter aftertaste that is hard to remove! If you want the health benefits I suggest a pill form unless you don't mind choking down a few berries!",1

I ultimately decided not to keep these in stock in the pantry - they don't quite hit the mark.",3

When it works like a charm, it's not uncommon to find coffee grounds in the cup. It's a mess.  I bought the same model for the office. The experience was similar.  Sometimes it makes a full cup of coffee other times it doesn't.  Sometimes it won't even work at all.  We have to turn it on and off and cross our fingers. A friend reports these problems as well.  I agree with the reviewer who says, DO NOT BUY.  A waste of money for the machine,for the K-cup that couldn't be used, and an exercise in frustration. We're in the market for a different brand.  When Keurig first came out, they had the market.  They have a lot of competition now . . . which hopefully will make it easier to find a machine that works well.",2
We had a yard sale and sold snow cones with Hawaiian Shaved Ice snow cone syrups! It was a huge hit! I especially liked the choice of 10 flavors...I will definetly be ordering more as we will be having several more yard sales before the season is over!,5
"I have found some of Kay's Natural food to be pretty good.  I wasn't really impressed with these chips, though.  I don't know if I will order again.",3
"Would recommend.  Keep in mind that it is a darker oil and more flavorful. Great for salads and meats, not sure about baking with it.",5
"I really like the taste of this drink. It tastes like a smooth fruit juice. I was expecting it to taste like a flavored tea, but it's more of a flavored fruit juice. I do like the health quality of it. And being that it is caffeine free, it is great for my whole family, my 5 year old loves it as much as his kool-aid, so this makes a great alternative! I would recommend it if you're looking for a fruity tasting drink, just don't expect it to taste like tea.<br />Also, it dissolved quickly. Some ""tea"" mixes tend to sit at the top of my bottle, this did not.",4
"These were not good at all... too spicy. Too ""limey""... the crunch factor was really awful... felt like my teeth were going to break.  (Love the name... the chips were AWFUL!) Wound up throwing the bag away.",2
"I don't know how ANYONE could rate this so-called ""cat"" food above a 1 star - it is CRUD.<br /><br />The food is cheap - stuffed full of fillers. My 4 cats prefer to eat old and dried up Fancy Feast crumbs before they even eat a bite of this junk. It comes out of the cans like a hard lump - the liquids drain out and you end up with a brick that has to be broken apart.<br /><br />Well, it's not so surprising this stuff ends up as hard as a brick - one of the major ingredients in ALL their ""flavors"" is Montmorillonite CLAY (yes, the same stuff used in oil and gas well drilling mud!) - ie, very similar to what cat litter is made from...<br /><br />To show how bad it is, even the raccoons and coyotes won't eat this junk - they'd rather eat carrion...<br /><br />Those that think this is ""good"" food, I can't imagine the crud you've been feeding your cats before - shame on you! Shame on anyone buying this crud - go buy a selection of Fancy Feast (Classic is hands down favorite for the majority of cats - and it's excellent quality food - puts this junk to shame) and see how quickly your cats will spurn this junk.<br /><br />I wish I could give this crud negative stars - it shouldn't be allowed to be sold.",1
"Ok, I've had this a few times on burgers, wraps, etc., and come to a final conclusion that it's barf. It has no spicy flavor at all, just a weird, off-putting flavor type. I thought this would be like the most excellent gordita sauce that comes in the Old El Paso gordita kit - but it's not.<br /><br />It's weakly flavored, and basically a way to translate fat onto your food. It's not bold or spicy whatsoever. I will give it the ""creamy"" moniker, however.",1
"My dog LOVED these treats.  Then one day, i actually read the packaging and saw these are made in china!  I feel betrayed by this company who pretends they use organic free range chicken, when really those words do not exist in chinese farming practices.  They buy meat from one of the largest makers of dog food in china, a MASSIVE factory.  And are fully aware of the FDA issued warnings about chicken products from China killing pets.  They state they test for everything, but since the contaminant has not been pinpointed yet it is impossible to test for.  Don't give your dog these treats!  Do your research and read every label CLOSELY as they really try and fool you with the fine print.",1
"I feel bad when leaving my pet so I usually give her a treat b4 I go out for the day.  It would be nice if they made treats that lasted atleast an hour each so your pet is happy and so are you.  this lasted about 1 minute, almost completely gone before I can even lock the door behind me.  But she loves it.",4
"Malted milk already has a fair amount of sugar, but this brand adds more pure sugar to it. For people who are addicted to sugar, I'm sure this tastes quite good. If you're not a sugar addict however, it is too sweet and the extra sugar detracts from the malt flavor.",1
"The Erewhon corn flakes is very good, light and organic...very expensive compare to other brands but it is one of those cereals that you can add fruits or other toppings to have your own taste. Buy a single box at a supermarket first before buying the 6 boxes since some people don't like it after buying it and are stuck with the extra cereal boxes.",4
"This is an excellent treat for my Lab, who has so many allergies.She dances when she sees the bag, and I like the fact that I'm giving her a quality treat.",5
"I think that the Tabasco folks tried sincerely to make this a good sauce: the basic idea was to mix a high-quality Worcestershire with Tabasco.  It should have worked, but I just think they misunderstood the things that make the classic Worcestershire so appealing.  Maybe they just opted for smoked anchovies or something, but this sauce has an unpleasant smoky, almost bacon-y undertone to it.  I've tried it again and again, hoping I'd get used to the difference, but in the end I had to chuck it in the trash.  From a man who has ordered and enjoyed multiple gallon jugs of Tabasco Regular and Habanero Sauces: this one is just not a winner.",2
It's been my favorite mustard for many years and I hate that the mfg only sells this small container. Constantly running out. This was a good price and with a dozen in the pantry I'm good for a while. Will order again if this price holds.,5
"I was impressed by the spicy. not too hot, not too spicy. its a pretty cheap product, so dont expect much flavor wise, but if your looking for something to sustain you, go right on aheed and dive into a bouwl of NISSIN HOT AND SPICY CHICKEN flavored noodles.",3
"I drink a shake every morning! I look forward to it EVERY DAY - no joke - I've always preferred iced coffee so I have mine cold (it's making my mouth water now!)<br /><br />Click protein is a PERFECT way for BARIATRIC patients to supplement their daily protein. I especially love Click because I was a DIE HARD STARBUKS customer - knew my regular crew, could pull up to the drive through and when they heard my voice they knew what to make!<br /><br />I make my shakes with milk or water -whatever I'm in the mood for (the milk helps boost the protein) and I use a Blender Ball bottle (this powder is super fine so you don't necessarily have to have a blender bottle, it just makes it easier).<br /><br />Not only has my energy level improved, my hair and skin are FABULOUS and I can enjoy breakfast every morning knowing there's nothing that's going to upset my stomach. I've SAVED MONEY TOO - I've said good bye to Starbucks. The espresso boost in Click satisfies my coffee fix and I never tire of it.<br /><br />It is HANDS DOWN THE BEST PROTEIN DRINK I HAVE EVER HAD (and honey...I have tried them all!)",5
I was excited to get a healthy protein treat and I was hugely disappointed.  I opened the first one and was appalled by the smell. I managed to choke down three bites and the only good thing I can say about this stuff is that it didn't make me sick immediately. I threw the rest away. Later I went back in the kitchen and thought I smelled where my little dog had an accident but it was only the open package reeking from the trash.  I have eaten homemade  ostrich jerky but this tastes nothing like it. It is hard to believe it is ostrich. Do not buy this product. Even my cats and dog couldn't eat it.,1
"I like Numi teas, but I found this flavor to be far too strong, and not nearly as minty as I'd expected it to be.<br /><br />Not a bad tea, just disappointing considering the flavor name.",3
"Multiply the cost of white miso paste by 5 before deciding to order, because shipping is outrageously expensive.  Packaging on the website is misleading, as you will not receive it in a resealable container.  Taste is good, but find a very clean, airtight container to store it in your fridge.",2
I bought this to attempt to replace Morning Edition which is no longer available. DH and Mom say it's too bitter to drink. I think it's just okay for a medium roast. I wouldn't buy it again.,3
"THE BEAGLE GIRLS LOVED THE LAMB AND MILLET....NOW BOUGHT SAMPLES OF THIS (HE DUCK) AND AGAIN A HIT..I WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED WHEN I OPENED THE BAG BECAUSE THE KIBBLE WAS BIG (COMPARED TO OTHER KIBBLES) I THOUGHT FOR SURE MY 1 YR OLD BEAGLE WOULDN'T EAT  SHES SOOO PICKY....BUT SHE IMMEDIATELY ATE IT AND TO MY SURPRISE IS WAS ""NOT"" AS HARD AS I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE ACCORDING TO THE SIZE! SO WE'RE HAPPY CAMPERS<br />THE TROUT DIDNT GO OVER TO WELL BUT BOTH BERGLES DONT SEEM TO LIKE ANYTHING WITH FISH...I WISH THEY DID BECAUSE I REALLY WANT ""ONE"" KIBBLE THATS GRAIN FREE.<br />ALSO CAME TODAY IS THE DRY WATER THAT I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY...BUT WILL WAIT TILL AFTER THEM HAVING THE DUCK FOR A FEW DAYS IN CASE THERES AN ALLERGY.<br />DEF RECOMMEND.<br />ALSO SHIPPING SAID OCT 5TH-11TH  IT CAME TODAY...THE 4TH!!!<br />FAST SHIPPING!",5
always liked lavazza.  there is no bitter aftertaste and find it both good for esspresso maker and regular drip depending on the strength that you like.  it was a great deal from amazon.,4
"I can't find these in the store anymore, so it was great to find them online! They're quite tasty and the best mints I've had.",5
Excellent tasting product.very hard to find in stores.great price as well.if you like chocolate then you will love this stuff.buy it while it lasts.,5
"No litter is good litter, but if you have to use it, this is good stuff!  I have tried every kind of clay, clumping cat litter on the market, and most recently a corn Arm & Hammer one (which is horrible!) and then tried this one.  I have 2 kittens, so I think all they do is sleep, play, and poop.  They took to it well. It clumps great, I sprinkle baking soda in after scooping.  It still smells much less than other brands, and I LOVE that I can just flush it and not worry about disposing of a bag of cat poop along with the already gross litter box!  I use the multi-cat one, and I like it!  Worth the extra cost.",4
I am not a big fan of this drink.  It says Apple flavor but it should say sour apple!!  It is very sour.  Now my kids on the other hand LOVE this!!  They would drinkit all the time.  I sayif you like the sour apple gum you will love this cause they taste the same.  And they both give the same stinky breath effect too....lol,1
Love these soft treats! Great size to use during training. My dog loves all of the flavors they have to offer.,5
"These self heating cans work fine, so long as your not in weather below about 50 degrees.  These heat fairly quickly, but I found the coffee to be too sweat for my taste.",2
"didn't get ,quite the taste i wanted,brought thru amazon. but overall will still keep using this product,until it runs out.",3
"Obviously the best option is to brew your own.  But if you're on the go, this is a good choice.  It doesn't taste too artificial, but is packed with sugar.  So beware if you are watching sugar.<br /><br />illy is a a premium brand, so expect to pay premium prices.  But it also tastes a lot better to me than the competing offerings from Monster and Starbucks.",4
My twins love this!! BUT Walmart sells them for $1/ for a 2pack!  Worth going there to save the extra $!,3
"I purchased Lipton Herbal Tea, Cinnamon Apple  on Amazon.com. Why you might ask? They have discontinued carrying it in the grocery stores. This has been one of my mom's and my favorite for a few years. When we couldn't find it, I had to look elsewhere. We have purchased other cinnamon teas, but they are not as great tasting as this one. It tastes and smells like a hot piece of apple pie. I hope Amazon.com will continue to get it.",5
"I ordered the complete set of Totonac sugar free syrups and tested them out with my morning Kellogg's Eggo waffles.<br /><br />Some of the syrups are pretty good; others are really not my thing and I threw them out. My verdict/opinion is: Almond, Maple Syrup and Vanilla are pretty good; the Raspberry is okay (if you crave some fruit taste); but I couldn't handle the taste of the Blueberry, Butter Pecan, Caramel, Hazelnut and Vanilla Cinnamon.<br /><br />The syrup is not thick like most syrups on the market; it's more runny and I find myself pouring some syrup out on to a plate and then dipping pieces of torn waffles.",2
"This is the only soda that has nothing in it that is bad for you.  In fact, it is one of the few drinks of any kind that is great for diabetics and those who want to lose weight.  For some reason, the Zevia flavors seem to have need for a little more sweetening.  Get NuStevia Clear liquid stevia supplement (available from Amazon), a put a couple of little squirts in there (don't over do it), and it really improves.  With other brands of stevia, the results are not as good.<br /><br />If you use this as something you drink only a couple of times per week, even $1 a can is reasonable (have you checked soft drink machine drink prices lately?).  The only thing keeping the rating below 5 stars is the price and need for more sweetener.",3
Make no mistake..this is one big bag of peanuts. Best when purchased on sale in Amazon Warehouse Deals. Get em at a good price and go make some friends.,5
after opening numerous bags I found that none of the chips had any flavoring on them. completely plain and gross. how does this even happen?,1
How can anyone go wrong with Chocolate Raspberry Truffle?  I enjoyed this K-cup and would absolutely reorder.,4
If you use significant amount of Cardamon you will like this package. I used to buy it in smaller quantities but the shipping cost for smaller packages is high ship so I opted for this one. Nice size kernels and great flavor. I grind it with coffee and have a great taste and mood! It makes the house smells great.<br />Enjoy it!,4
nothing wrong with this item... matter of fact its really tasty... my only problem is that i cant finish a bag with out feeling like i need to get my teeth get checked for cavities... i recommend you split a bag to multiple sittings or share with a friend,4
"Still looking for a good toffee peanut.  These are very large peanuts, and have a nice flavor.  You won't be sorry you bought them.  But, the toffee flavor is not quite right for my taste.",4
"Hey, I don't buy instant coffee because I'm expecting a flavorful delight.  I buy it 'cause I want something hot and coffee-tasting that I can throw some splenda and milk into.  This does the trick. If I want coffee that tastes of cream and vanilla, I can pour in the right flavored mix and get a decent result.<br /><br />This stuff tastes fine, prepares easily, doesn't leave grounds, and stores compactly and forever.  Most days, that's all I want.",4
"I love this coffee.  I like light roast, but many of them have little flavor.  Green Mountain Breakfast Blend has a nice smooth, full taste without being harsh.  The flavor of some dark roasts leave me with the impression I could get the same effect by just licking the bottom of a dirty ashtray.  (Sorry, dark-roast lovers - I tend to be overly sensitive to bitterness.)",5
"I tried these squares this morning, but even with the addition of more brown sugar than what was in the product, they were tasteless!  I agree that they are crunchy, but I expected much more from the product, more on the order of Kellogg's Little Bites which even kids seem to eat with relish.  I don't know what I'm going to do with the remainder of the box as I can't recommend this product, but I hate to throw food away, even when I don't like it.",1
"They're good, but I think I prefer the Keebler version. The Keebler ones are very similar, but have a little more frosting.",4
I was really looking forward to this coffee but I was  very disappointed.  I will not reorder.<br /><br />I received Cameron's TOASTED SOUTHERN PECAN COFFEE as a gift at Christmas and was totally delighted with it and have already reordered it.,2
Taste great in coffee and oatmeal. The worst thing about it is that it's not available currently and doesn't seem like it will ever be. I only purchased one at the time and went back to get more and they were out!,4
"Excellent intense flavor, a cut above other lychee teas (such as Foojoy) that I've drank over the years.",5
"Like others, I ordered this product after Petsmart stopped carrying it. I ordered 3 packages a month or so ago and the treats were fine, my dog LOVED them like always! When I went to re-order, I read the review about the treats now being ""basted"" with duck flavor instead of being wrapped with dried duck pieces and thought it was weird, because my order was the same. That is, until I received this last order of 4 packs this week. All of them were basted or really more like stained in duck flavor -- my dog, who was usually so excited to get one of these treats, left it on the floor untouched. We are both VERY disappointed -- not at Amazon, but at the manufacturer for changing their product",1
"Love this Watermelon Essence water!  It is so refreshing!  I am really bad about drinking water throughout the day, but this product makes it easy.  I look forward to drinking it now.",5
I like the coffee but this time I found the good Hazelnut taste missing.<br />Good price for the coffee.,3
This is the most incredible tea. It tastes great and gives me an energy boost every time I drink it - and it has no caffeine which is incredible. It tastes lightly sweet due to the citrusy flavor. I first tried this tea in a 5-star restaurant and had to have more so I signed up for quarterly delivery. I can't believe I'd be so excited about tea :-),5
"We ordered pecans from two vendors this year, and these were by far the best. As good as any I've had.",4
I srewed the top off the bottle without removing the hard plastic pull ring. Makes me wonder if it's safe to use. There is not other covering and I put the cap back on and it looks like it's never been opened! Since it's a powered supplement this doesnt look safe. I gave it a two because of the seal and the fact that I'll probably have to return it.,2
While they may be healthier than your standard fare this is not the 'finally a quick meal' that I hoped it would be.  Our daughter did not like one type and we tried them all twice just in case.,1
"These are very artificial tasting, and just not tasty. And I have a very very high tolerance for artificially sweetened products.<br />Overpriced...Chrystal Light lemonade would make a better lemon drop.",1
Why do I have to order 2 jars of the same jam?  What if I don't care for the taste..then stuck.,1
"I bought this spray because it doesn't contain Deet and is in pump, not aerosol, form; however, its protection was meager.  I used it on a beach in Honduras to protect me from sand fleas.  My husband chose to use nothing.  I ended up with half the number of bites, but I still had many bites.  In even more insect-heavy areas of Central America, I had to resort to a Deet product because this Picardin-based repellent did little to discourage biting flies.  This is much better for mosquitos than for other biting insects.<br /><br />While I would use this spray in instances where the flying insects are bothersome but not relentless.  In areas where your health may depend on repelling insects, look elsewhere.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann",2
"I have 4 dogs and all were sick on this food. One actually almost died. It had to be ressucitated. After I spent $4,000.00 on Vet's bills I decided to call the FDA to analize this food. They found Ethoxyquin on it - a pesticide. [...] I just want to make sure if someone out there has the same problem, that it must be known. I'm still not happy about this incident. I decided not to pursue it any longer, but I still feel people should know. These 'Organic' companies can't get away misleading people. If everyone exposed them, then this would be a better world.

The blend is very strong and full flavored.  I was expecting more of a French roast flavored blend.  This coffee is the harshest I have tasted.  If you like a coffee that is super dark and will give you a kick this is the one for you.  I'll finish this batch and try the French roast next.,3
"Yuck.<br />This coffee tastes terrible.  It does not compete in the same league with any other dark roast coffees I've had and I will never order it again.  In fact, it makes me sorry I bought a Senseo.",1
"I had this gum for the first time yesterday, and I was so disappointed. The gum tastes great It has a pleasant fruity flavor to it. It's too bad the flavor lasts for less than ten minutes.<br />As a test, I had another whole piece today, and again, in a few short minutes, no more flavor. Then, I took another piece and this time bit it in half, and the flavor lasts for half the time (which never happens with other gum like Trident).<br />When I bite on it, there is a tiny gooey center which, after chewing, blends in with the rest of the gum. But after five minutes, the flavor is gone. There's a faint taste, but it isn't enjoyable.<br />Until you plan on wasting your money and spitting out and chewing more gum every five minutes, stay away from these Mentos Gum. If you want fruity flavor, try something with a much longer-lasting flavor such as Trident or Orbit.",1
"This kept my dog's attention for a couple minutes the first few times we used it, but now she has no interest.  I think my 2 year old enjoyed it more than my dog did.  It seems to slide around too easy and our dog has a tough time getting the yellow ""cups"" out.  She's not overly food driven, so that may be part of the problem.  Guess we'll try something else.",3
"This India spice chai tea wasn't my favorite purchase. In fact, I am thinking I would relist the unused teas in the container and get rid of it. Hopefully someone out there loves it. It's almost a new box.",2
"I recently cut fiber one bars out of my diet after I noticed that I get all the fiber I need in a day just by eating whole wheat bread, fruits, vegetables and nuts. If you don't have many of the aforementioned foods in your daily diet, then one or two of these a day may be a good fiber supplement. However, this comes at the cost of making you extremely gassy all through the day, which can be embarrassing and sometimes even annoying when it's more frequent than the occasional toot that slips out. IMHO, it's better to get the daily dietary fiber your body needs via the more natural means that I mentioned above.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind, especially when dieting, is that these bars are pretty high in sugar. (As much as 10g added sugar per bar!) Considering a ""healthy"" amount of added sugar per day maxes out at about 40-50g per day, eating a few of these bars will chew right through that cap in no time. There's also emerging research showing that eating high-sugar foods (like fiber one bars) will make you crave more sweets, leading you to eat or drink even more unhealthy things like candy bars and sodas. So if you're on a diet, eating these bars probably aren't as great for your diet as you think!<br /><br />I've been fiber one free for two weeks now and I'm happy for the decision. (And so are my friends!)",2
"I am a mom concerned about BPA and wanted to find something I could safely use in the freezer, and found this one among others and I liked that this one came with a lid and they style of it is pretty cool.  The only thing I don't like is that when I am freezing things that are more dense, like my homemade rice pudding, they are hard to push out when they are still in their frozen form.  When I freeze the same thing in a traditional ice tray, I don't seem to have that problem (I think because it is flexible rather than ridged, the tray flexes rather than releasing the food)...  things that are more watery like frozen juice are not as hard to get out.  Over all, I like it, and it makes really fun round popcicles!",4
Nowhere in the description does it mention anything about this coffee being flavored. I'm still not sure what flavor it is. Some type of nut. I wrongly assumed that Jamaican coffee would be similar to the Blue Mountain coffee which Jamaica is known for! How silly of me to assume that! I hate flavored coffees so I was so disappointed to now own 2 boxes of such a horrible coffee. It only says flavored very small on the box so I didn't notice it before I opened it. Hopefully I can pawn it off to visitors and buy some regular bold coffee-flavored coffee for myself!,1
"I got one package of Peacock Brown rice Vermicelli free from the Amazon Vine program, in exchange for writing a review of the product.<br /><br />I thought this product would be a healthy way to eat pasta, and it reminded me of Asian rice noodles when I removed it from the packet.  We like brown rice and try to eat whole grain pasta, to add complex carbohydrates to our diets.<br /><br />I soaked it for a minute as directed, then added it to a hot wok, along with sesame oil, shrimp, chopped green onion, precooked chopped bok choy, a little soy sauce and ginger.  I tossed it gently for a minute and thought perhaps it would soften up a bit with the oil and heat, but all it did was turn into a clumpy glob.  We did manage to eat some of it, and pick out the shrimp and vegetables, but none of my family liked this product at all.  It was basically tasteless in addition to being gummy.<br /><br />I've never seen any type of noodle go from crunchy and breaking into pieces, to a gummy wad of glue so fast!<br /><br />I won't be buying this product in the future.",2
"I have been to New Orleans at one of the Pat O Briens and had there hurricanes and this mix can taste just like what you would get at the restaurant.  The key is  that the mix  makes twice as much as it says it makes, so if you go by the directions it will takes powdery.  So either use half as much powder or twice as much water, mix with your favorite rum(what they use), vodka or gin and a nice sweet hurricane.",4
Love these.  Not messy.  Not bad for baby.  Melt in his mouth. And come in plenty of flavors! Others have complained about not selling variety packs.  My son goes through them so fast that it is worth it buy a couple sets!,5
"The good thing about this is there were no duplicates.  The bad part is, they were still all very similar and so far I haven't particularly enjoyed anything I've tasted.  Bitter and rather stale tasting frankly.  And my biggest issue is the fact that of 35 packs, only 5 were flavored.  We were hoping to discover something new by ordering 35 packs and it turns out that most of them are just bold coffees.  I already get that with my Sumatra k-cups from Starbucks.  I would definitely not purchase this again and would not recommend it.",2
"I am really disappointed of this product. The closest way I can think of describing the flavor is like I imagine it would taste if I left an opened, half full can of cola overnight on the counter, so it is totally flat, and decided to mix it with yesterday's coffee left over. Does it sound appealing to you? Not to me. It is not totally gross, but far from good.",2
"it is the worst coffe pod that i have ever had. stick to sanseo there is nothing else to say, donot buy",1
"If you couldn't tell, it's a bottle of water. A really big bottle of water. It has a slight taste to it, like one person said kind of a tap water taste, but I didn't think it was bad. I didn't particularly find it any more refreshing than any other water. I don't know if I truly felt the effects of the ""best available pH"" (9.5). It did have a pretty silky feel to it as I drank it. It is supposed to have electrolytes in it so if you want to be able to have hard workouts in the heat where electrolytes are truly needed and you don't want the sweet taste of sports drinks or Vitamin Water AND you don't mind the high price, this may be for you.",4
"Over the past two years, this has become my favorite morning drink.  I have had gut issues in the past that were exacerbated by the acid in coffee. I never thought there would be anything else that I could like as well as coffee.  But Teeccino has proved to be a great substitute. When I'm going to be doing something strenuous like hiking or biking, I add a measure of regular coffee for a little caffeine boost.  It also works perfectly for the latte that I usually make every morning with an electric frother. Since it's made to be brewed, you can make it as strong as you like.  It's rich and delicious and leaves no aftertaste.  The flavored ones, such as the chocolate mint, are delicious as a nighttime drink with no danger of that 3 percent caffeine keeping you awake and also blend well with steamed milk or cream.  Iced Teeccino in hot weather is also another option.",5
GREAT---ALWAY'S DELIVERED ON TIME AND WHEN I WANTED TO SKIP A DELIVERY THERE WAS NO PROBLEM.,5
"It looks good, fits in my kitchen.<br />However, it leaks over the  top after I use it; especially in case of oil and soy sauce,<br />which makes my kitchen dirty.",3
"This product, Xylosweet, has no aftertaste and is used just like sugar.  It's all natural.  It's more expensive but well worth it.",5
I have an older dog who would give these treats 4 paws. She loves them. She will remind me when it is treat time. So 4 out of 4 paws. Thank you Blue Dog Bakery.,5
"These would be okay on a hike when I am famished enough to eat my backpack.  But on the sofa, these bars do not satisfy;  they are far more savory (and not in a delectable way) than sweet, and necessitate a tall drink of anything.  The pumpkin flavor prevails over the banana, followed closely by the taste of the boiled apple juice.  I crumbled apart an entire bar just to count the molecular-sized chocolate chips (3).  While I do like Kashi cereal, I'll be disposing of - rather than digesting - the remainder of the box.  I would much rather go to the trouble of baking my own banana/pumpkin/whole wheat bread with proper adult-sized chocolate chips.  The reason I am giving these 2 stars instead of 1 is that I do like the hint of barley and the (too few) crunchy oats on the top.",2
I seen this type of butter and a movie so of course I went to amazon to find some. Product arrived fast and tasted .. well like pistachio butter. Would recommend and will buy again.,5
"Yummy.  This stuff is surprisingly quick cooking (not like the McCann's that you buy in the steel cans), but is far superior in texture and flavor than the typical boxed oats (you know, the one with the smiling man on the label).  I cook mine in skim milk, which adds no fat but provides creaminess that lets you skip the butter.  A little honey on top is my preference, but oatmeal can be so many things to so many people.",5
"When we opened the box, we found it to be full of small worms. My husband was able to remove them with a small brush but they shouldn't have been there in the first place. We have gone through many many boxes of greenies and this is the first time we found worms in them. The dogs love the greenies and it helps their teeth a lot.",3
I can't believe I wasted almost $20 on this. They were burned! They were inedible! It was so nasty and they took forever to arrive!<br />You should take this product off of your product list. Worst product i've ever ordered,1

"Not a fan of all the spicy noodle bowls; they all go way overboard on the salt and the heat is overpowering. So far, the only non-spicy available from Nong Shim are the Ginger Beef and the Savory Chicken. I prefer the beef, but the chicken is a nice alternative. The flavor may be too mild for some; it's basically a thin chicken boullion. If you're looking for spiciness, you won't find it here. And although the salt content is pretty high, it doesn't seem to taste as salty as the spicy version, but I definitely don't taste any ""styrofoam."" And this comes in an 18-pack instead of the usual 12, so the per unit price is on the low side. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a non-spicy, cheap ramen.",4
"because it isn't bacon.  It tastes like Baco's, which don't taste like bacon.  I fail to understand how anyone who really loves bacon can be satisfied with an imitation.",2
"Great taste and texture, I like sweet mustards.  The list of ingredients is given except for specified spices. It's a 5 ***** for all that.<br /><br />But the rating drops because the hex-shaped jar annoys me, it's hard to get every bit out.<br /><br />Overpriced: I got spoiled when I bought a case of this at .99 each at my local discount grocery and just bought a jar for $1.47 there.  I can see around half of $4.39, we don't all shop at NYC Gourmet Food Shoppes, but c'mon, as good as it is, this is MUSTARD.",3
"the product was all as advertised except for its taste. it did not taste good. moreover, the almonds did not add to the taste and tasted like plastic chips almost. just a bad taste overall. would not recommend.",2

"While there are lots of small coffee roasters whose espressos I enjoy, this is truly a good basic everyday espresso.  Espressos should be dark and full bodied. This one is rich and flavorful.  It makes a nice crema.<br /><br />It is also good for using in a countertop espresso machine. We have a Jura Capressa E8 Super Automatic.  A lot of the flavored coffees and roasts that are too dark gum up the system and make it sluggish.  And while it is not a big deal to change the grinder, it is probably better to use a bean the machine likes.",5
A waste of my money. Extremely weak; even if I do 2 K cups at a 4 oz cup. No flavor. What I ended upd doing was to purchase Extra Bold K Cups and use Stevia Clear Hazelnut drops.,1
"I purchased these apples for my 2 year old son. He LOVES the Today's Farm freeze dried apples but since they have been unavailable through Amazon for the last few months I have been trying different replacements. This is my third alternative purchase. These apples arrived today, a day before expected, however they are nothing like I hoped. The pieces are tiny, like what you would sprinkle on oatmeal or in pancakes. I was expecting larger pieces (as pictured) for my son to easily grab. Definitely not what I got! The taste is OK. Won't be buying again.",1

"I was quite disappointed in this tea.  Had saved it for a special evening and it simply was too perfume smelling, tasted like it too.  Very upsetting but fortunately I have some Octavia teas for us to restart a new pot of tea with.  I certainly would not suggest a purchase of this particular type of tea.  Go with Octavia's Rooibis & Roses tea instead along with a small teaspoon of PG tips if you want some zip to it.",1

I've ordered Greenies two times now and both expire within a week of receiving them. I sent the first one back and won't see my money for 4-6 weeks. Guess I have to do the same yet again. Spend the extra dollar at the grocery store to be sure they aren't going to expire before you can use them. I don't plan to feed my one dog 30 greenies before they expire on the 4th.,1
"I purchased Smooth Move with the hopes of a mini-colon cleanse because I had felt bloated for several weeks and seemed to have more weight around the mid-section despite the fact that my diet had not changed. Having never weighed over 100 pounds except during pregnancies, I was very uncomfortable with my sudden 'spare tire,' and I had at first attributed it to menopause. My first experience drinking the tea was surprizingly pleasant. The taste was like drinking any other flavored tea. There is a pleasing hint of sweetness without added sugar. A bit spicey but mostly I recognize the licorice flavor. The tea did not take 6 to 12 hours to work as the box advises. The results for me began about 2 1/2 hours after drinking the tea. I did experience some minor cramping, however, not as bothersome as my past experiences taking senna tablets, so I do believe some of the other ingredients are helpful in relation to reducing cramps. After 4 visits on the porcelain seat, I felt so much better and lighter. I had been weighing myself daily for several weeks and after my first use, I did in fact lose 4 pounds. I felt less bloated and more like my old self again. I would definitely recommend trying the tea for the first time when you can be near home for 24 hours after since the action is quite sudden and may occur sooner than  6 hours.",4
I was delighted to find this product on Amazon because I can no longer buy it locally.  It has a wonderful deep chocolate flavor and a friend and I enjoy one every morning with our coffee at work.  I also like the fact that it's only 100 calories.,5
"I was very disappointed by this tea as it has no orange flavour and also is not spicy at all. It tastes like a rather boring, cheap black tea. Only the tea bacgs themselves seem to be dirty with an orange colour, so probably there are some colorants in this tea. As the box is so big it is a pain to finish them... I would recommend not to buy it. A good orange spicy tea is the one from Harney & Sons.",1
"Shipped from the U.K., these chocolates taste awful....sweet and very 'unchocolatey.' They are not the Cadbury fruit and nut chocolates I am used to. I checked the wrapper to look at the expiration date.....turns out they are manufactured in Russia! Not sure how Cadbury allows for this to happen....but they are clearly messing with their reputation. DO NOT BUY!",1
"I've fgound the cure for drinking too much coffee inthe morning. Get this one. I thought, when I first had this, that I had accidently wiped the sugar spoon with a Mr Clean cloth, but the next day, I had one cup of Tully's and made the second cup, the Green Mountain Breakfast blend. The disinfectant taste was back. I would not buy this one again.",1
"These are FANTASTIC for people who can't eat sugar, i.e. diabetics.  If you've scoured the globe looking for a sugar-free snack that doesn't have that ""fake sugar"" flavour, your search has ended!<br /><br />I am a HUGE Haribo fan.  Before they were widely available in the US, I had a friend in Germany send me Haribo candies all the time.  My biggest fear was that these would not live up to expectations.  I was relieved to find that I can barely tell any difference.<br /><br />One word of caution that has been mentioned by several reviewers: You cannot eat these in large quantities.  THIS GOES FOR JUST ABOUT ALL SUGAR FREE CANDIES!!!  Stomach discomfort, flatulence/gas and diarrhea are all well-known side effects of most sugar-free candy, so it is not wise to eat more than a dozen or so pieces at most.",5
"Tastes GREAT! But this is way too light. If you can see through your coffee, drink something else. I love this flavor but they might as well call it exlax. You need to be by a bathroom after consuming this coffee. It will destroy you. Naturally sweet. Use less than normal sweetener when you brew this.",3
For nearly $20 and a photo showing two I thought I was getting two at an AVERAGE price! Very deceptive. If I have made a mistake and another one is on the way... But I don't think so.,1
Some of the cookies were crumbled.  I also found out that these cookies routinely sell for $2.50 each at walgreens.  Paying more that $4 per for some crubled cookie did not go well.  I will not be purchasing this items again.,2
"This muffin mix is awesome. I am so happy to have found a mix without sugar that taste good. Because of my food allergies I just mix the batter with water, add stevia and spices and leave out the eggs and oil and it makes the house smell like I am cooking spice cake. It taste good. I end up eating almost all of the muffins the same day I make them because they are so good. I will always keep this mix on hand.",5
"I like a hearty cup of coffee, not bitter. This is quite weak on the Keurig medium setting, which I most frequently use, and just tolerable on the small cup setting.<br /><br />I prefer Donut Shop, Fog Chaser, and other rich-bodied coffees -- and I even like Lake & Lodge, whioh isn't a rich coffee if that helps you compare.<br /><br />This is so-so even when I mix it with a good flavored coffee; it just lacks its own flavor.",2
I bought this flavor coffee after reading the postive reviews...so maybe it is just me but this flavor had a distinct unpleasant after taste.  Couldn't really taste the butter toffee flavor either.,2
"This looks like a better deal than it REALLY is, and I wonder how many people who actually did the math for themselves would truly be pleased.<br /><br />This product is listed as 64 ounces, for a cost of $39.75, and they break it down as $0.41 per ounce. This would be a fantastic deal.<br /><br />HOWEVER, $39.75 for 64 ounces means this costs over $0.62 per ounce! This is not cool. I'm not sure if this was done intentionally, but it's bad business.",1
"I have been purchasing chocolate fudge orgain for over a year now and I have always loved it. Recently, the taste is different and does not taste as good. I am wondering what happened.",3
"After you drink all types of coconut juice including fresh juice from real coconuts you can figure the taste of coconut juice and its slight variations.  This juice is too sweet and most likely artificially sweetened or sugar was added to it.  Or it tastes like it was sweetened severely and its all in my mind.<br /><br />Well, I emailed Amy & Brian and got no response.  Just ignored my inquiry.  Guess a company who wants to be ""all natural"" does not care what the customers think.  All respect down the drain....literally.<br /><br />Conclusion:  Buy VITA Coco, ONE Coconut Juice and stay away from this garbage.",2
"I tested the pH of this water. I am very disappointed because it's far from the generous promise. The pH barely reaches 8 and is not any different from the spring water I receive from a water delivery service.<br /><br />Don't be fooled. Promise is not kept. Or, well, you may try for yourself. pH testing strops are easy to get. Let me know your result, I am curious.",1
"ordered this based on reviews, and of course, price. quite a bit less than k cups. initially thought coffee was too strong, but, after a couple tries i now actually enjoy the rain forest mix. packaging does make it less convenient - for most the k cup machines are bought for convenience, so, you will need to weigh that against the price. these come in a vacuum sealed package per 12. once opened you will need to move them to a reasealable bag to stay fresh, no biggie. my biggest gripe is the water, when brewing, tends to shoot down the back side of the front of my machine and the holder also drips water for quite a while after brewing. this is because these cups are not really cups at all but filters with a top. like the inside of the regular plastic k cups. so, the machine is just shooting water through a filter - the pressure is not really doing much as it does with the k cups where the pressure actually drives the water through and out of the sealed plastic cup. the coffee seems to taste fine even though it is working more like a drip coffee maker with a turbo boost. for my machine at least - i need to do a quick wipe down after brewing or there are some puddles around. so, less convenient. however, once my regular k cups are finished up i will switch over as the price justifies a bit less convenience. hoping they come out with some more flavors.",4
"I am a fan of broccoli, especially with mac & cheese.  So, I had hoped there was quite a bit of broccoli flavor in these boxes.  What I got instead was all ""flavor"" and not much broccoli at all.  There are two packets and one has about 1-2 tablespoons of dehydrated broccoli and the other has a flavoring that slightly smells like broccoli but mostly just seems salty.  The kraft macaroni / noodle product is pretty much exactly like Kraft Deluxe thought the noodles may be slightly different shaped.  You get a packet of liquid Kraft cheese and this to me is way too salty, seems just like canned nacho cheese dip.  I think the powdered cheese packets they offer in standard mac & cheese boxes have more flavor and seem to taste less salty.  I found that for the money, I could just as easily buy boxed mac & cheese (any flavor including organic or whole wheat) and add frozen chopped broccoli (which usually comes in a very large bag for just a buck or two).  Considering this box assumes you will add grocery bought chicken anyway, you could just as easily buy broccoli as well.  The extra cost of this box just for the small amount of dehydrated broccoli is not necessary.  I found that I could eat healthier & cheaper for the same cooking time by buying these products seperately, hopefully this will help your decision making.",3
"We bought this because our little one wasn't a regular formula drinker so it didn't make sense to open large tubs of it, only to throw it away.  It's a great idea but obviously you are paying for the convenience.  I've been thinking of buying a vacuum packer but wasn't sure it was going to work with powder and worth the time and effort.  Also, this stuff is great for long road trips or travel.",4
"I purchased Taste of the Wild with roasted lamb along with two other Taste of the Wild flavors as a variety treat for my two dogs (51 and 75 lbs). Used solo, the food set in the dish for a couple of days until I mixed it with another brand (C&P). I then started filling their dishes with half and half and noticed that they would always eat the other brand first and then finally come back and eat the ToW lamb as a last resort.<br />We have not tried the other two ToW flavors yet, but hopefully, they will like them better.",3

This is a great tea.  I like to drink it in the afternoon at work.  It helps to relieve all the built-up stress of the day so that I can go home and not vent it out on my husband.,4
"I got a bottle of Budweiser Mild & Tangy Wing Sauce at my local farmer's store for a decent price.  However, I ended up dumping the stuff out - both my son and I agreed that it tasted like salad dressing. I'm sticking with Frank's Red Hot.",1
"I was very impressed with the taste of this peanut butter. After playing around a bit with the water to powder ratio, I got a smooth creamy spread that was fantastic on a piece of bread.<br /><br />Be sure to measure out the amount you want by weight, not volume. I am dinging them one star because their serving size is 21g or 2 tbps. I found that 21g came out a bit over 1 tbps, but it is definitely not 2! Since most people are likely buying this to watch their calories, that's a big error. You still end up with enough to comfortably cover a piece of bread.",4
I bought two bags. They both were maily full of small scraps. One hag had even dried out despite being well within its experation date. The price was good but the quality is just not there. I will not buy this brand anywhere again.,2
"You should monitor your dog very carefully if you give him/her these chews. One of our dogs died as a result of eating these chews, and the other three were very ill for two days. This product is very difficult for dogs to digest and can result in blocked intestines and infection. Since the package did not contain any warnings, we thought they were harmless. Be very careful if you buy these for your dog.",1
If you don't have the time to cut up ginger and boil it for it's wonderful flavor here's an alternative.  This tea is refreshing.  True ginger flavor and punch is wonderful.,4
"The first problem: There's only 3% juice! Unless you're dumping artificial flavors in there, 3% lemon juice isn't lemonade, it's lemon water. But I'd rather have lemon water than deal with...<br /><br />The second problem: Stevia has no place in lemonade. Maybe in tea, where its molasses-like earthy flavor would blend well, it might work. But the stevia clashes horribly with what little lemon flavor comes through, resulting in a thoroughly unsatisfying beverage.",1
"Ordinarily I do not drink sweet coffee, and all the iced k-cups I've tried have been gooey and bitter. I tried this one when Green Mountain had a special, and now I'm ordering more for my daughter! It is very sweet, and makes a relatively small amount (the ""iced"" setting on my Cuisinart brewer is sends only 4 ozs. over the ice, and I wouldn't recommend more than 5-6 cubes in the glass). But brewed that way you get a refreshing, sweet, nutty drink. It's really rather strong this way, and has a surprising caffeine kick, which I don't get from my hot hazelnut brew. With record-breaking temps in Atlanta this year, it's a welcomed treat!",4
"Easy to grow but my cat had no interest in the grass.Started wilting in 8-9 days,completely dead after 12 days.",3
"I'm not sure when Cytomax changed their formula, but in regards to taste it was a huge step backwards. The old Tangy Orange was smooth and satisfying with no aftertaste. The newer version leaves a sharp aftertaste in the back of the throat long after is is consumed. Not sure if the addition of Stevia is the cause. I just can't drink it like I used to and now choke it down like all the other nasty sports drinks that are so common. Also the addition of caffeine to Tangy Orange was a surprise. I don't like to consume added stimulants as they just don't work for me and lead to GI distress on the trail. Also what's up with all the foam after shaking it up in the water bottle? Cytomax has been so good to me over the years and I'm disappointed that this version has become more unpalatable. I used to give Cytomax 5 stars, now just 2 stars.",2
"I use these small 2-oz energy drinks several times a week, and have bought them from various sources.  I've paid anywhere from .88 cents to $2.98 for them, depending on where and when I buy them (Lately, my local dollar store is carrying them!).  Over the years I've found the taste varies from brand to brand, and so does the energy level. Some brands give more of a ""buzz"" than others (which I don't care for), while others give a nice, steady boost during the day.<br /><br />Upon opening the package, I noticed two things about Red Rain right away, one good, one not so good.<br /><br />Good:  The label was VERY easy to read!  On most of these 2-oz energy drinks one needs a magnifying glass or maybe a microscope to see what's in the bottle. Red Rain makes their labels very easy to read.<br /><br />Not so Good:  According to the label, the vitamin B levels in this product are exactly 1/2 of the 2-oz drinks I get at the dollar store.<br /><br />That said, I wanted to give it a fair trial. Main main question: Would 4166% of my daily recommended B-12 (Red Rain's numbers) give me enough of a boost, or would I notice a difference from my usual intake of 8333% of recommended B-12? (per the drink I get at the dollar store).<br /><br />For my preferences, the test produced both good and not-so-good results.<br /><br />Good:  The product tasted rather pleasant with very little medicine flavor.<br /><br />Good:  No unpleasant buzz.<br /><br />Not so Good: Half of the B vitamins gave me about half my normal energy boost. I like a good boost, and although this product provided some, it wasn't what I normally shoot for.<br /><br />Conclusion: If you like a mild-tasting energy drink that provides a mild boost, this would be perfect.  If you prefer more of a boost, you probably want something with more B-vitamins.",3
"This sauce is not as spicy as I expected and had a significant amount of olive flavor to it.  There were whole chunks of olives which caused one person I had over for dinner to kind of pick around his plate.  This is not what I was expecting.  Overall while it had a fresh taste to it, I was expecting a product with more flavor.",3
This coffee is just delicious.....smooth and yet very RICH...  Makes me feel like I am in Hawaii.......Just look forward to mornings with these pods in my Senseo machine!!!!,5

"Wasnt happy with this purchase. Coffee was completly stale I guess thats why they price was good, But wont purchase again.",1
"OMG - these chips taste so good! I used to live in the UK and remember eating those delicious salt and vinegar chips. Flavor-wise these aren't as tart and vinegary as those, but they have a really nice twang to them that's not overwhelming, with some sweet/salty/savory overtones. Texture-wise these are light and airy. They are about 1/8 inch thick, like a mini rice cake though not as dense. They are great for dipping or eating all by themselves. The bag has just the right serving size. You don't feel too full afterward but they are definitely filling.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them four stars instead of five is because even though they are natural, they aren't organic, and most non-organic potatoes are GMO (genetically modified), so maybe not totally healthy, but definitely delicious!",4
"Shipping was prompt.  Packaging was good.  However, the 'bulk' product was actually more expensive (~$1 or 13% more) and not as good as available locally 'by-the-piece' in downtown Chicago.<br /><br />In addition, we were hoping that there would be nutritional information.  There was not.  Instead, there were 76 pieces in a plain plastic bag weighing 16.1 ounces.<br /><br />So, overall the vendor performed well but there was no value added.<br /><br />Quality Comparison<br />-----------------------<br />The wrapping was similar but the candy is less sweet like it contains HFCS instead of honey and the texture is noticeably coarser and seems to stick to our teeth a lot more.  This made us miss the nutritional disclosures even more.<br /><br />Cost Comparison<br />--------------------<br />Bayside Candy on Amazon = $8.59 / 76 pieces = $0.113<br /><br />Downtown Chicago at Kramer's Health Foods = $7.60 / 76 pieces = $0.10 or about $1 less for the same quantity and we have the flexibility to buy as many or few as we like.<br /><br />In short, we found no advantage and will continue to drop at in the local health food shop and get our sesame treats along with a friendly smile and without the extra packaging waste or wait for delivery.  Amazon's great, but you can't win 'em all.",3
"This went from $21 to $56?  What gives?  I'd give this a great review as it is a wonderful brew, but this new price is ridiculous.",4
These remind me of lemon bars (wheat crust with lemon filling topped with powdered sugar) Those were always a treat in my pre-GF days--these have that strong lemony flavor but with the advantage of not being as gooey to eat :),4
Very disappointed with the product.  Most of the crackers were broken when they arrived.  They were nothing like the ones I had received at a conference in individual wrapped packages of 4 cracker.  Not happy with the product as received.,2
"I just purchased a bag of this sweet and salty mix from a vending machine and there was only one M&M in the bag. Buyer beware. I am putting out an all-points-bulletin on this travesty of justice. Be sure to check the bag before purchasing; you may get the short end of the stick.<br /><br />UPDATE: When I finished the bag (the previous review was written while I was still eating), I found another M&M, so the total count was two M&M's instead of one as previously stated. I apologize if this poses an inconvenience for anyone. I still stand by my review. I should have gotten more than two M&M's in my bag.",2
"Where I live I can only get my hands on two types of pocky: strawberry and chocolate. Nothing wrong with either flavor, but friends elsewhere have access to more variety. So upon finding this my fingers couldn't hit ""Add to cart"" fast enough. It's a very nice selection of flavors, I really liked milk and orange. The various other candies were just as good.",5
"I bought this product as an attempt to reduce the crystal light I drink.<br />This drink mix had a very strange after taste. It didnt blend with the water all that well. In the summer time on a hot day I might drink it,  but they really should try to improve the after taste effect and the way it mixes with water.",2
If you like fresh coconut milk I would highly recommend you do not purchase this product. It is nasty - there is an odd taste to the product.,1
"The reason I purchased this product is for the ""No Sugar Added"" clause. I am annoyed with all the sugar that is added in almost everything. Every kids cocoa drink has too much sugar added. After I tasted my first drink, it felt  too sweet and had an after taste. The taste of an artificial sweetener. After checking the ingredients, I noticed it contains ""Sucralose"". According to Wikipedia, Sucralose is 600 sweeter than table sugar! What's the point of buying something that has no sugar added but adding something that's tons of times sweeter? I am not going after the calorie factor. So does Nesquick add 600 times less amount of Sucralose than sugar to get the same sweetness? I don't think so.<br /><br />Another major problem is that Amazon's ingredients section does NOT mention Sucralose. It mentions Aspartame which, according to Wikipedia, it's 100-150 times sweeter than sugar, which means much less sweeter than Sucralose. So did Nesquick change their ingredients and Amazon did not update their ingredients list?",1
"IT is hard to get this clean.  You can soak it, but then it's hard to get it dry.  Since it is plastic, I don't want to put it in the oven.  Also my dogs (Blue heeler mix, Miniature poodle/cocker mix) don't enjoy it was much as the Kong toy.  I think that's because the Kong's movements are wobbly and more erratic--more like prey.  This cube just clunks over and they lose interest.",2
"This is good nori! It comes in a resealable package, and tastes just as good as what I get from sushi resturants. Overall I am pleased",4
"I was so excited to try a new BOLD coffee.....needless to say, I am disappointed. I would rate this coffee as a MEDIUM. If it would have been listed as a MEDIUM, I would have given it a higher rating because this is truly a MEDIUM strength coffee in taste and flavor. I will still drink it from time to time- flavor is smooth, not bitter. Overall, I wish that I would have ordered some more Jet Fuel or Black Tiger.",3
"This review is under my name because that's the way the account is set up, but my wife wrote the following:  If you go by the directions and use the pod, draining the results into an 11 oz. mug or glass filled with ice, you may find it undrinkably peachy and overly sweet. I mean, it doesn't ""say"" peach so much as scream it.  I diluted it with a lot of water, and it was a little better.  On my second try, I used a large, sturdy, microwaveable measuring cup to catch the tea, and ran water through the pod twice.  If you've never done that, the easiest way is to flip up the pod lid and push it back down quickly without removing the pod, so it recycles.  Then I poured half of it into a large unbreakable ""Clacks"" mug filled with ice. I suggest you taste it, and if you need to dilute a little further, just add a little more cold, filtered water.  As the package says, putting hot tea directly into an ice-filled glass may cause it to crack. That's why I used a glass measuring cup that's resistant to temperature changes as well as a beer stein-type mug made from an unbreakable poly.  Anyway, the results of my second method was enough iced tea for myself and my husband using a single pod.  It still tasted quite peachy and wasn't over-sweet.  I even got that odd ""fuzzy"" feeling on my tongue that I get from real peach tea, in fact.  Seems to me that getting two glasses for the price of one makes this a good deal.  BTW, if your tea turns a little cloudy, I should note that I've occasionally had that happen with traditionally brewed tea as well. (The tea in one mug did, the other didn't.) I forget the explanation for that which I was given years ago, but it doesn't affect the flavor.",4
"These are delicious. Arrived as stated. Excellent buy on Subscribe and Save. Great for those looking for ""Gluten free"" products.",4
"I love the Soda Stream unit, but the syrups need some tweaks.  It is too sweet, so I use half the amount required; this is good if you want the product to last longer; this is bad because they use Splenda added to all their recipes, not just the diet.

"There were a few pieces of candy that were considered ""nostalgic"" but not many that I couldn't get at any store. Also the ""nostalgic"" candy was old and hard. Not like it should be. The price was decent and the delivery of the items was good. Just not impressed with the item.",2
These were terrible and horrible --- I ended up giving them to a vegan friend of mine who is a health nut and she liked them.  If you are used to eating food others would consider inedible then these are for you --- if taste is important DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT.,1
"My dog loves this game.  As soon as he sees it, he runs over and waits for his command.  Even though there are 7 areas to hide treats, I usually only do 4 or 5.  When I give him the commad ""Find the treats"" he sniffs by each cover until he finds the one with the treat.  Then he gets his jaws around the cover and tries to pull it off, sometimes not on the first attempt.  He goes around until he has pulled off each cover that holds a treat.  The ones that are empty, he does not bother to remove the cover.  Really AMAZING Toy!!!!<br /><br />I would recommend keeping the toy hidden until it is time to play, especially if your dog is a chewer.  The covers are small and can be chewed up quickly.",5
"I was drawn to this product because it's called a ""feast"", but I was somewhat put off by it being a ""Fancy Feast"". My cat certainly deserves a feast! I mean, he runs himself ragged from morning till night going after mice and by the end of the day he's bushed. And frustrated too, since I had him declawed and all. But he don't need anything fancy, that's for sure. I just want him to enjoy a cat feast and leave it at that. He's not one of them cat's that prances around with his bushy tail waving around like some lady feline. I know my Tubby Toughie would be in cat heaven if they changed the name to ""Fighter Feast"" or ""Beastly Feast"". So, I'm giving this product 3 stars: five stars because it's a pretty great feast, minus three stars because the name offends Tubby Toughie, and plus one star because I like to lick the can.",3

"SO WORTH IT.  And when you do the math, it's actually a bargain.  More on that later....<br /><br />Some background:  My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier.  He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband).  He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food.  Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison.  Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Amazon.  I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...).  So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats.  Titan went mad for them.  It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares.<br /><br />Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door.  He barely lifted his head from the bowl.  For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France.  When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure.  Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine.<br /><br />Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept.  When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet.  I added a little canned venison to entice him.  No go.  Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating.  Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there.  Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag.  Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag.  I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time.  The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO!<br /><br />But back to my point:  I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!).  So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain.  And, it is a lot of food packed into those tiny squares.  Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam?  Titan's never had that with this stuff.  I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up.<br /><br />So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line.  I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!).  I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well.",5
"Bought this on a whim! It was on sale and I had no expectations. How bad can dried mango be, right? Wrong! The appearance of the product is extremely unappetizing - little black uneven lumps with sprinkling of salt on the dried mangos. In my opinion, the taste is salty, gummy and disgusting. I have eaten many dried/cured mangos before and this is the worst ever. This whole lot is going into the trash!",1
"I used to buy Dogswell happy hips jerky for my dogs but after the recall with chicken jerky from China, I bought a bag of True Chews since its made in the US. I was extremely disappointed when it arrived. It was so dry and tough that I couldn't break it down for my small dogs (they are 10 and 14 lbs). Giving them a whole piece caused them to choke on it!",1
"Wow, these are really good!  At first, I didn't understand ""Popchips"", and I was actually expecting something like regular fried potato chips, only made from sweet potatos.  The Popchips are very different from that!<br /><br />These contain rice flour as well as sweet potatos, and they are kind of air-popped, very light like popcorn.  Texture-wise, they remind me of ""Munchos"" only lighter and without the oily feel and taste.  Remember Munchos?  These are WAY better.<br /><br />Next thing - the flavor from the sweet potatos is YUMMY!  I know when I first read ""rice flour"" in the ingredients, I was thinking those cardboard-like rice cakes.  The sweet potato completely takes away any blandness or boringness and adds good taste.  And there is just a touch of salt - just enough to bring out the YUM without overdoing it.<br /><br />Finally, the package size.  When I saw ""0.8 ounce"", I expected that I would want two, three, or even four bags of these at a time.  Nope - one bag is a good snack!  Not that 0.8 is a big bag, or ""filling"" or anything like that, but the bag is just the right size, which is a very pleasant surpise to me!  I finish the last chips, like the last of the salt from my fingers, and I feel satisfied - like, wow, that was tasty and just right!  At Amazon's prices, I believe I will be buying these regularly!",5
"The Caribou Coffee is of course equal and the same as any I could buy in a store or at any other on-line vendor.  The time it took to get to me was unacceptable though.  I will not be ordering my coffee from this vendor again.  I opted to pay for speedier shipping although I was eligible for the free Super Saver on this item, because I knew I would soon be running out of coffee at home.  I then received a notice of a shipping date that was almost 2 weeks from order date!  I had to then take my time and get stressed arguing with them about the fact that I'd paid extra for expidited shipping. I did get my shipping fees refunded, but not my coffee sooner.  So I had to then go out to a store to purchase coffee to use until the order from Amazon finally arrived, which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place by placing the order on line.  Not a happy camper on this one!",1
One of my dogs is quite selective when it comes to treats.  She often turns away from them.  She loves these and has never refused one.,5
"A little drier tasting than beef jerky sticks, and also more salty.  Very salty.  Someone else mentioned a gamey taste, I'd agree except that I didn't think it was too much.  I wouldn't like these if I wanted to eat them frequently, but I'm more like once a week or two.  Good for that, for me.",4

"This 1.5 Liter bottle of water tasted just like water. If you want water with baking soda in it that tastes like water, this seems like a good bet. I was worried about the taste...It didn't taste great to me (I guess I'm a bit of a water snob drinking only home delivery purified water) and I prefer simple RO water.<br /><br />But the big selling point of this water is that it is alkaline. The reality is that your body has a built-in pH regulating system in your lungs and your kidneys. Want to increase your blood pH? Breathe faster. But even then, when you stop thinking about it, your brain will regulate your breathing and your kidneys will adjust to make your blood pH whatever your body wants it to be. You may be able to cause some short-term changes in your blood pH by changing the pH of your water. But your lungs will quickly compensate. You may see some differences in your stomach pH and thus some relief of indigestion similar to taking an antacid. But if you are having gastrointestinal symptoms from acid, you probably shouldn't be treating with alkaline water but should seek medical help to see if you have something more serious going on or should get some more effective antacid medications that have fewer side effects than alkaline antacids. I can find no research to substantiate the claims that alkaline water is beneficial for your health.",2
"My puppy who is a toy rat terrier was not eating very much of her merrick puppy plate and not gaining any weight. So the vet told me to mix wet food with her dry food. So I switched her to Fromm's Surf & Turf grain free dry and then started mixing some of the Fromm's wet canned shredded beef. My puppy devoured this and licked her bowl and went looking for more. The best part is that I can take her right outside after eating and she goes right away. And, her stools were still formed not messy. (Gross, I know but important to pet owners who don't want to clean up mess). This stuff is better than Weruva too. The weruva cans were filled with more liquid and consequently, the stools reflected this. But Fromm's is the best. THe doggie loves it and she didn't have any side effects even transitioning her all at once the way I did. The ingredients in the food are all totally healthy and the pup loves it. Great company, all holistic, safe, and made in the USA not  in Communist health hazard China.",5
"The Lickety Stick is truly a unique product. It's basically a rollerball bottle (like some deodorants) with different flavored syrups (like chicken, beef, or bacon). I've never seen anything like it. The promo video says dogs love the taste and it's very low cal (oddly, the video also warns of an epidemic of pet obesity, which while probably is true, I had never heard it described in such catastrophic and somber tones). The treat is on the high price end of what dog treats usaully cost, but the maker boasts each bottle contains over 500 licks. I've been trying to figure out if that's a good deal. Normal-sized treat bags don't usually have 500 treats, but on the other hand, you would never just give your dog 1 lick off this thing.<br /><br />If your dog likes the Lickety Stick (there are review testimonies here going both ways), then it's left up to you how long puppy gets to lick, so the touted cost-effectiveness could quickly evaporate (there is no recommended serving size on the bottle). All in all, the Lickety Stick reminds me of a sugar free lollipop. They can have a decent flavor, but not everyone will like them; they don't have calories, so they're ""healthier;"" and because they're calorie free, they don't fill you up at all, which leaves me with a final thought.<br /><br />Regular dog treats do at least have a substance factor; they are a solid food. The Lickety Stick is a calorie free liquid, so the filling factor is missing. And so while Charlie did enjoy the Lickety Stick, she probably won't be getting another one. She is already in great physical condition, eats an organic dog food regimented according to the bag-recommended diet, and is taking C9 vitamin supplements. Basically, she gets enough health stuff is what I'm saying; so when she does get a treat, I want her to enjoy it like the treat that it is. I'm not convinced the Lickety Stick does that. Now, if you are trying to wean your pet off table food or lower their weight, this product could probably help you do that.",2
I am not a huge coffee drinker but I need some caffeine every once and a while. This is alright. It does taste like hot chocolate but on the largest cup setting it tastes like chocolate water. The middle setting is alright but I feel it tastes the best on the smallest cup size. Sometime I will mix 2 of the small cups together to get a decent size drink. I am a fan of the Cafe Escapes line as they taste very good and don't make a mess while making. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a small drink!,3

"I tried this coffee first when travelling in Europe, and I loved the intensity of the flavor. It doesn't taste burnt, and it's not unpleasantly bitter. I tried drinking other kinds of coffee that you can just find in a supermarket, but nothing compares to Douwe Egberts coffee. Also, I usually prefer to buy coffee beans, but I was able to find Intense only ground. I was afraid it would not be as fresh tasting because of that, but that is not the case at all. This coffee is one of the best I've had!",5
"If you don't send water through the same tea disc a 2nd time, and don't add sugar, you will taste too much nutmeg over a cheap assam or green tea (which tastes like dirt). I also squirted some light whip cream in it and over it. After trying the undrinkable Gevalia cappaccino, I was relieved to find something I liked. The creamer isn't bad in this one. I don't know if it's a different kind or if it is a good combination of seasoning. I gave it 3 stars because for this price, Twinings should have used a better grade of tea. It tastes pretty good now, but there is still that lingering aftertaste of earthy tea. With the milk, it fills my insulated glass 3/4 of the way full. One other feature, it smells wonderful brewing! It IS Thanksgiving in a cup (thermal glass, I mean.) Using the 20% coupon at Bed, Bath, & Beyond, you can get the 16 disc (8 servings) pkg. with their free standard shipping for $1.09 per serving (before tax).",3
"If you want a lot of ""pow!"" in the way of salt and vinegar....this is not your bag of chips.  By that I mean that the malt vinegar flavor is fairly subtle.  It has a slight sweetness like you'd figure from malt vinegar.  The chips are nice and crispy, however smallish, which is fine for a small bag as such.  Overall...good flavor, salty enough, slightly tangy/sweet.  I shall very much enjoy the remainder of the case I bought, but may try a case of something else in seek of something with a little more bang.  Having said that, I appreciate that they use real malt vinegar solids and sea salt. Unlike some ""kettle type chips"" that use cheap acid variants that simulate the salt and vinegar flavor, but leave your mouth and tongue feeling like you swabbed your mouth out with sandpaper.<br />If you like Salt and Vinegar chips, they are certainly worth a try to see if they fit your taste.",3
This product needs to have better packaging.  Many of the biscuits arrived broken and crumbly which detracts from any prospect of reordering.,3

"I have gone through 5 lbs of this flour, trying everything possible to change the consistency that it comes out as...with NO luck.  I do not have her cookbook, and I think in order to use this flour you have to use her recipes.  Every time I use this flour the consistency is gummy, sticky like a very glutinous rice flour.  Muffins, scones, pancakes, all came out with a very dense and chewy center.  It even has a transparant type of look to the center of baked goods.  I have tried to use this flour to thicken broths and the four just balls up into little gummy things (Bob's Red Mill works a LOT better).  I would not recommend this flour to anyone.",1

"We have tried a lot of different treats (Milo's kitchen meatballs, Train-Me treats, etc), all of which were great, but I have settled on Zuke's because they are already the right size for a small dog and seem to be made with not too many fillers.  I have a 2 1/2 year old rescue who had a lot of 'tude for 11 lbs.  We adopted her a year ago supposedly already house- and crate trained, but she was absolutely neither. Apart from great advice on aspca.org, it takes a TON of treats to start training an adult dog from scratch.  Of course we used plenty of things around the house (cut up string cheese, hard boiled eggs, stuffed frozen peanut butter in Kongs), but sometimes you don't have anything prepared and you have to crate the dog and get to work.

I'd tried other sugar free items but they all had a seriously bad after-taste to them. The artificial sweetners were pretty bad.<br /><br />But the Murray brand are pretty darned good. And I can eat about 6 of them that equal 32 carbs (I'm a tall guy --- 6 feet, three inches --- with a big frame).

"I purchased this cereal because it appeared to be very healthy and promising. But once I received it and after smelling and tasting it i knew something was wrong. I know a rancid smell when i smell it. I would not feed this to my baby. I tasted and it left a terrible after taste. I called the company and read other reviews on this defect. The company says since there is less fat in this specific product, a smell has resulted but it does not affect the overall product and is safe to eat. I was sent another container but this had the same smell, so I would conclude that the recently made containers are all like this. The expiration date was in 2013. Sorry, but anything that smells like this I would never give to my baby. However the oat and rice cereals do not have a rancid smell and I give those to my baby every day and do not see a problem with them. I still need to research more into the extraction method of DHA which may also have something to do with the smell.",1

Just had a cup of chicken bouillon made with it - nothing else would do as I am nursing a cold. Ya know, CHICKEN SOUP! I also use it to flavor rice. It says reduced sodium but is still plenty salty, frankly. When I add it to rice cooking water, I don't use additional salt. Learned that the hard way. And I am a salt lover. Can't imagine how salty the regular version must be.<br /><br />The stuff is viscous, gooey even but dissolves fairly readily in water I've preheated in the microwave.

It's just a good basic cup of coffee for the average person. Basic is what I'm looking for in the morning.",4
I tried each salad dressings of walden farms and bleu cheese is one of the most unsavory ones that also ruins the taste of the salad. It tastes and smells like white glue. So I would suggest Coleslaw dressing which is great and can also be used for Caesar salad. French also tastes good for giving a spicy taste to the salad.,1
Our dog loves them and keeps her entertained for a good hour. She is very picky so I was glad to find something like this.,4
"I ordered this item by mistake.  I thought I was ordering the Pizza Crust which our family just loves.  When I saw that I have made the mistake, I decided to give it a try - we now had 6 packages.  But this was the worst GF bread we have ever made.  Had to keep putting it back in the oven because the middle was raw and outside was hard as a rock.  We tried to eat it, but just threw it out - the first time I have ever hated a GF item so much!",1
This coffee has me looking forward to my breakfast coffee.<br />I've been able to get two good cups out of each pouch<br />on my single cut maker.<br />The resulting coffee isn't as oily as some blends that I have tried<br />recently. I'm enjoying this box while I can.<br />My local store doesn't stock these specialty brands.,4
nothing like the pictures and in fact a lessor product.....will not order it again..<br />not in their best interest to do such....,1
"I was quite excited when I ordered this product because chai is one of my favourite hot drinks.  However, upon my first sip almost all I could taste was the Sucralose.  It was like licking a metal pipe with spices sprinkled on it.  I hadn't paid attention to the ingredients prior to that point but the use of Sucralose was obvious.  If you're sensitive to artificial sweeteners, like Sucralose, you probably won't like this product.  Otherwise, it seems like it has potential.  I might have liked it if it didn't use artificial sweeteners but as it is I won't buy this product again.",2
"I was very excited about this purchase until I tried this truffle.<br />These were horrible.  Maybe I got the worst bottle they have ever sold and I just happened to get them.  But, these are bad.  If you want to eat the root of a dirty old root of a tree, you will enjoy these.  If you doubt my credibility of my review, please feel free to read my other reviews.  Please don't waste your money.  My wife tried these and couldn't even believe these could be called truffles.",1
"The price at amazon varies for this product, it is competitive unless it gets to almost 30 for 4.  Quality is good.",5
"The crackers themselves are delicious, but I ordered pack of 6 boxes, and LITERALLY not one cracker was whole. As I opened each box, I held my breath, hoping that box would not just have pieces of what was once crackers...  All 6 boxes were just pieces of crackers!!  I wish they had been packaged better.  :-/",2
"I was hopefully that since this was a mixed food combo it would be thicker in consistency - WRONG! It was like straight water. It made such a messy. I used it with my 6 month old who has recently started solids, but this was a disaster. He did seem to like the flavor, that's why I gave it 2 stars. I am going to keep it so that when he older I can mix it with some oatmeal for breakfast.",2
I love Oreos but hate the filling.  These prevent me from having to scape the filling out and they're good for you - calorie wise.,5

We were expecting a case... but no - we got 23 cans thrown recklessly in a box that arrived with a hole in it - some of the cans were dented! Will not be making this purchase again unless we can be assured this will not happen again.,2
"I have purchased this in the store and loved it.  These boxes were introduced to the local stores at 99 cents each.  Now they are running about $2 per box in the store (each box contains 5 packets/ net weight 7.55 oz.). If this is a 6-pack, I can't see why I would spend much more than $12 to order on-line.  I'd even throw in a little extra to get the ""unusual"" flavor that I like but WOW -- WHAT A HUGE MARK-UP ON AMAZON!",3
These are pretty good actually. They used to have a better Asian side dish but of course discontinued it. Now I can't find this in the store. Hope it will be around!,4
I HAVE AN 8 YEAR OLD CHIHUAHUA AND HE HAS NEVER BEEN A CHEWER.  HE DOESNT CHEW HIS TOYS AND DOES NOT EVEN LIKE TO EAT DRY FOOD.  I HAVE HAD TO HAVE HIS TEETH CLEANED EVERY YEAR WHICH IS VERY EXPENSIVE!!!  I HAVE TRIED ALL THE DENTAL CHEWS AND STILL NOTHING.  MY DOG LOVES THESE TREATS!!!  I AM VERY PLEASED AND LUCKY TO HAVE FOUND THEM!  WONDERFUL PRODUCT!,5
"The coffee package leeks out all over machine wial brewing.Not a good manufacturing job.the coffee is good, what ever gets into your cup.",1
"I admittedly liked this product.  People thinking ""I like smoked salmon"" may be thrown by this product at first, but think ""jerky!!""  Very chewy: the larger pieces can give your jaw a good workout, and every once in awhile you hit a peppercorn which makes your eyes water (in a good way).  Good salmon flavor.  I would be a happy consumer except that I have run into moldy strips in two separate orders.  Got the 8 pak, and on pak #6, almost the entire contents were fuzzy.  An e-mail to the company got absolutely no response, but Amazon was kind enough to replace it in spite of it being a generally non-returnable item.  Unfortunately, the replacement jerky also had a white fuzzy mold pocket in one pak.  Not in every pak, but since you tend to chew jerky while busy doing something else (fishing, driving, whatever), it gave me the creeps knowing how little I looked at most of this stuff when shoving a strip ""in between my cheek and gum.""  Eat in good light and keep your eyes open.",2
"I love the taste and texture of these bars; they're sweet, but not overly-sweet and have a satisfying, nutty crunch and just enough chocolate to make them interesting.<br /><br />UNFORTUNATELY, I apparently have a severe negative reaction to the artificial sweetener, maltitol, used in the chocolate coating.  About an hour and a half after eating one, my abdomen puffs up like a balloon filled with air, resulting in a very sore, achy feeling tummy and (excuse me) painful gas that lasts about three hours.<br /><br />Many people have this reaction to maltitol; if you're one of them, you'll have to learn, as I painfully have, to avoid anything that contains this sweetener.<br /><br />Hopefully, the company can make some maltitol-free versions of these bars in the future.",3
Great tea. Like dessert in a cup. Only 4 stars because Numi is better.,4
"The Switch Kiwi Berry is 8.3 ounces and has 135 calories, 15 mg of Sodium, 34 g of carbs (11% of daily value), 33 g of sugar and oh yeah 100% of your Vitamin C daily value. Mind you, a 12 oz can of Coke has 140 calories, 50mg of Sodium, 39g of carbs and 39g of sugar. So apart from the no sugar added, preservatives and all the added artifial stuff, there is not much of a difference in nutrition between these two products. Need the Vitamin C? Drink orange juice. Yes, the Switch may be a tad healthier but it is still a can of empty calories. Moreover, a can of this may not be enough for most people, so double the calories if you decide to drink two.<br /><br />As for taste, it is too sweet. I agree with the reviewer that said that this tasted like apple juice. It does. It tastes like over sweetened apple juice. There is a slight (very slight) hink of kiwi and none of berries. The sweetness is too strong at first but it does grow on you.<br /><br />This soda has way too much sugar, almost as much as a regular can of soda, and it tastes like it. It is too sweet for my taste. Frankly, giving the calories for this small can, it is not worth it. Now, I would like to try the Diet version if there was one.<br /><br />As for price, each can is about a dollar. Way too expensive. This is like paying $1 for each of those small Coke cans (the 8 oz small cans). Would you pay a dollar for one of those? Neither would I.",3
"I have loved ""Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli, 7-Ounce Packages""(I am assuming at that age they might have been another brand but they were the vermicelli) since childhood.  I loved watching the waiter get a wok full of hot olive oil, adding veggies and various meats(whichever you chose) and throw these noodles into the hot mixture....poof...they were little bird nests with yummy food inside.<br /><br />I did this at home with  ""Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli, 7-Ounce Packages"" with crab, orange, cilantro, Vidalia onion sliced very thin and threw in the noodles...Poof, I was back to childhood.<br /><br />Delicious after being tossed a bit with a slice of lime.<br /><br />Wonderful choice I made and I will make it again.  They are incredibly healthy so tasty and good for you....how can you miss?",4
We really enjoy this coffee. Have been using it for some time . We serve it to friends & family and have had nothing but compliments. I would recommend this coffee for anyone who uses K-cups.,5
"There are many things to like about the Black Cherry Switch drink.  I found the taste to be very good. Also, since juice by itself, can be a little flat, the small amount of carbonation in the drink gives it that zing that seems to further enhance the taste.  I was happy to see that it is 100% juice, but on the down side, Switch has 130 calories.<br /><br />Now, if you're drinking a lot of sodas, this could be the way to change your habits. Drinking one can a day would be a delightful treat with the benefit of juice, which may not be a part of your diet at this time!  It's worth the switch!  Sorry, I couldn't help myself!",4
"I ordered these cookies and expected boots the monkey but did not receive them.  I spoke to Amazon who sent a replacement package.  The replacement package also did not have boots the monkey.  I did receive compensation, however it did not help with needing them for a 3 yr old birthday party.  Dora cookies look nice, produced in 07 and expire in 09.  Before ordering next time I would contact customer service.",3
"I just received my order today and what came in was NOT what is shown in this picture!!! It is NOT made with organic soybeans. Yes, I should have read the other reviews. Shame on me. This is the same stuff I can buy at my Walmart but don't want because I WANT my soymilk to be organic. I ordered the vanilla too and it says ""certified organic"" in the details but it is NOT organic either. Shame on you, Silk!!!!!",1
"I like Starbucks. My partner does not much care for them. So you get both sides of the spectrum in this review.<br /><br />On opening the bag (which didn't seem to be vacuum packed ??) the coffee smells slightly of vanilla and you can see little bits of bean (or something non-coffee) in the mix. While brewing I have to say I didn't smell much, but when the coffee is poured into the cup there is a nicely subtly hint of vanilla aroma. (Nothing like the Folger's we often buy, because...hey! We are cheap).<br /><br />My partner says: it's ok. It almost tastes like someone put vanilla extract in the pot because there is an almost alcoholy aftertaste to the brew.<br /><br />I get almost no vanilla flavour, but the scent is pleasant. It tastes like regular Starbucks coffee which is to say slightly more bitter than grocery brands and more drying to the tongue with a nice roasted aftertaste.<br /><br />At $6.50 (if you buy enough to get free shipping) a bag this is OK, but you might find it cheaper (if you like it) at your grocery. They just got it at our local store & it is on sale for about the same price. We liked the Melitta coffee we tried better...and--well to be honest the Folger's Gourmet has a lot more flavour.",3
"I rarely write reviews but wanted to warn others of the affect these lollipops had on me. I've never had any stomach problems and can eat just about anything. However, every time I ate these lollipops, I would get a mild headache and feel nauseous. I really have no idea why but that's exactly what happened. I thought it was a fluke, waited a few days, then tried some more and had the same results. Some reviewers point out the fact that these are made in Mexico and I don't know for sure but wonder if that was part of the problem. Regardless, eat at your own risk.",2
Thought I was saving time by buying online.  The image is of a larger bottle but in the description it is for the smaller bottler. The price was higher for the big bottle than I had previously paid at BJ's who had sold but was out last time I went to buy it there.  Buyer beware these come in several sizes. They are becoming more available so I will buy locally from now on...,4
"I have tried more chocolate nutrition bars tthan i can count... And these are good, but hands down the saltiest! Reminded me of beef jerky, only chocolate! I ate them, but will choose other varieties in the future. If you crave salt though, these are yummy!",4
I bake alot of different types of items and this is a good vanilla that is multipurpose for many items.  Pastry and cake and cookies alike. So I do recommend it.,4
This brand is only 95 cents per can at my local grocery store ($11.40 for 12).  Canned mushrooms are convenient and the product is good so I gave it 4 stars.,4
Tastes pretty good but it's difficult to eat by being sticky to the wrapper even after refrigeration.,4
"I purchased this product as an alternative to a rawhide. Our 5 month old German Shorthair Pointer puppy ate it in a matter of 6 minutes or less. She loved it, but it was more of an expensive treat.<br /><br />With a puppy, I needed something to satisfy her chewing urge. The treat fractured into small bits all over the floor but our dog was willing to pick those up. The pieces looked rather sharp and that was a concern. Others mentioned it was made in China and I would like to add the first ingredient is corn.  It might last longer for very small dogs.",2
"Fortunately, my kittens have had no ill behaviors while eating this food like the previous reviewers cat. I mixed this in with my Purina Kitten Chow that my kittens were eating and the kittens seemed to really love it. My other two, one year old cats were also fond of ""stealing"" the kittens dry food instead of their usual Iams (where real chicken is the main ingredient), so this must be tasty. Usually, I just feed my cats dry food on a free choice basis and supplement with canned cat food and boiled chicken meat. My only gripe is this isn't a dry food that someone on a strict budget could likely readily afford on a regular basis for a number of cats. Otherwise, this is a good quality kitten food.",4
this was delicious coffee for a great price which i could not find at any store in my area or areas nearby,5
"These are quite good. I wasn't too sure about them at first, but the more I ate them the more I liked them.",4
"These are DELICIOUS~and the best part for me is that the product contains only potatoes, no additives, etc.  Awesome!<br />I searched a lot of different companies before I found these.  I will be ordering again and again from them.",5
"January 3, 2012<br /><br />I purchased the Beef Stroganoff from Omaha Steakhouse last week. It arrived in a small tray covered with plastic. I didn't really read the instructions for preparation ... just got out my trusty skillet and lid. I popped it out the container and addded just a couple teaspoons of water and let it simmer. It simmered about 15 minutes before I tasted it.. The sauce was delicious and the beef was tender. There was only one thing lacking [noodles]. There was only a tiny beef of egg noodles and alot of meat. Nonetheless, it was tasty. I give it 3 stars.",3
"For starters, the bottle is made of thick & heavy glass which is very durable to take with you when on the go. The taste is very good, and tastes pretty much as you would expect it to. My only wish is that it would have been a bit hotter. Its heat is very very mild (IMO), which surprised me considering the ingredients do in fact list Jalapenos and Habaneros. Other than that, its well worth the money!",4
"I purchased these depending on the stated CERTIFIED ORGANIC SEAL. This item however is NOT the ORGANIC Grits which means they could be made form GMO corn.  No where on the package does it say ORGANIC and in research I found that Bobs does have an Organic Grit, but it is NOT this one. (even though amazon has posted the Certfied ORGANIC SEAL!!) BUT WOW * I contacted Amazon ""Help"" regarding this issue and was immediately issued a refund for 'product not as described'.  Amazon has been my favorite online retailer for several years and I am subscibed for auto ship on over 16 items.  Now I can add that they indeed have a great customer service policy.",4
Let's see that's FROZEN lobster tail for more than $50 per pound.  You can get -- right on this site -- Live New England lobster for $10 a pound.<br /><br />Am I misreading this?,1
"Great source of selenium, quality is tops. Value priced. I only wish they offered a ""roasted"" version.",5
"These were nasty, they were so greasy and too rich for my blood, plus they lacked major flavor, no spicy jalapeno flavor at all.  I was so dissapointed in these chips, I am always hearing great things about these chips but I am telling you, yuck yuck yuck.  Give me pain chips any day.  Maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but I am staying clear from these chips. I wish I could give these zero stars if I could.",1
"I found this surprisingly good, it didn't have that ""I'm such a good health food that I taste like bamboo and cardboard"" flavor. It doesn't go soggy in the first 30 seconds which is REALLY nice. And because it's gluten free, I didn't bloat out like when eating Kashi and other wheat cereals. And I found it just right sweetness-wise, not sure why other reviewers were coming down on it for that. Sweetness is subjective and I probably tolerate a higher level, so for comparison, I can eat Honey Nut Cheerios all day, but if you give me regular Cheerios then I need a bit of sugar or at least a banana thrown in there. If you prefer straight Cheerios out of the box, then you may find this a bit too sweet, but it's not like Frosted Flakes, lol.<br /><br />This is good, definitely one to buy again, although the selling price is a tad high becasue you only get 10 ounces in a box. But good food costs, so I guess I wouldn't expect this to be a buck a box. Enjoy!",4
"I was offered the opportunity to taste this product because of Vine. I would not normally purchase this type of product, so my review and opinion will be biased in that regard.<br /><br />I'm not a big soda drinker, I'd just rather drink water or coffee. I will occasionally drink a diet soft drink, usually Diet Pepsi or Diet Coke.<br /><br />Did you know that a single 12oz can of Coke Classic® has 140 calories and 39 grams of sugar? This 8oz can of Switch has 140 calories and 34grams of sugar. And this is healthy? 4 ounces less is size, same caloric content and more sugar per ounce that Classic Coke. OK, so it's not ""added"" sugar, but still, that's a lot of sugar. 100% Orange juice, 8 oz, has 120 calories and 28 grams of sugar.<br /><br />The can says it is ""Orange Tangerine"" but in fact the contents are #1: Water #2: Concentrates of Apple, Grape, Tangerine, Orange, and Acerola juices. Then they throw in some ""gum acacia"", ""natural flavors and colors"" and some ""ascorbic acid(vitamin C)"". And as a little surprise bonus, they have added ""soy"". Soy?<br /><br />I asked my wife to taste this product with me. I poured the drink into two glasses and we both took a sip. Her reaction was swift and strong... she hated it. I agreed with her. It was for me, sickly sweet and left a sugary aftertaste in my mouth. Not only that, but the taste was just nasty. It didn't taste at all like orange or tangerine to me. It just tasted terribly sweet with an undefined cirtus something taste. The carbonation did not add anything positive to the experience. Neither of us finished drinking our 4oz portion. It went down the sink.<br /><br />I would not purchase this product in the future and if I could have given it 0-stars, I would have. It's that bad.",1
"Hi, does this supplement make you super thirsty?  I wanted to check because I have been feeling very thirsty especially in the late evening.  It has coincided with me taking this supplement.  But I have heard that excessive thirst is also symptom of diabetes.  Is it documented anywhere that magnesium can result in thirst?  If anyone can share this info, it would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />As for the product, I just started it.  The taste is citrusy.  I have had no side effects other than thirst.  But I don't know how much is psychological I have already been feeling more energy.  I will update if I continue this for a longer time hopefully.",4
"I have purchased 3 bags of Taste of the Wild Bison and Venison. I had 2 Standard Poodle when I purchased the first bag. My 5 yr old SP is notoriously picky and has a very sensitive stomach. She LOVED this food. We went through the first bag and both were doing great. (Gaining weight which is very hard for her to do). So I ordered a second bag, exactly the same. They ate almost all of it over several weeks and all was fine. With the last several cups in the food container the 1 year old SP became violently ill like she has never been before. The older one then became sick. I figured they had gotten into some thing outside and reordered. The 3rd bag came several days later, both had recovered completely by this time. We also got a Bichon Frise puppy about a week before this. The older dogs had Taste of the Wild late in the afternoon and the puppy grabbed some they had spilled on the floor. All 3 dogs then became ill, throwing up all night. Immediately the next morning I removed all Taste of the Wild from the house and put them all on puppy food. Everything cleared up. I have called customer service and was told their vet would be calling me. That was several days ago. I have now emailed requesting a refund.",1
"My wife and I like the Act II Microwave popcorn that you used to be able to buy in the microwaveable bags at [...].  Recently we saw this and decided to try it.  There are some problems.  First it is almost impossible to not get too much on.  The dispenser is made to use with a huge machine, not a family size microwave popper.  I finally had to put it on with my fingers.  Even then I had to be very careful because it was very easy to get too much on.  I probably used a 1/4 teaspoon total and that seemed to be a little much.  We had to sift our popcorn too to get it to work right at all.  This container will easily last us 100 years or more and that brings us to the second problem.  They need to sell this in a smaller size (and with a much better dispenser that allows you to control how much comes out).  It is gaggingly salty if you aren't extremely careful.",2
"Though I wasn't expecting a lot from a soft toy, I was hoping that this would be able to provide a little more relief for my teething pup.  While the bone is easy to use and freeze, the actual 'enjoyment' time is limited and not worth the time it takes to refreeze.  After about 5 minutes, the bone was thawed to the point it was dripping and could easily have holes chewed in the fabric.  When I went to refreeze it, my poor pup didn't understand why I was taking her toy and ended up becoming disinterested very quickly the next time I brought it out.<br /><br />Another issue I hadn't thought about until after freezing is how hard and heavy the bone becomes.  If you have a puppy that likes to 'throw' their toys or pounce on them, this can become a flying projectile.<br /><br />Though it did seem to help with the soreness of teething, and provide a cool treat, the overall experience left a lot to be desired.",2
"It is probably one of the most recognizable bottles if you are looking for absinthe.  After seeing the word ""Absente"", taking a look at the bottle with the attractive vintage-like label and the line ""Absinthe refined"" you are sure you have found a nice absinthe for not so much money.  Specially since most of the time the bottle comes in a box with an absinthe spoon as gift.  However, although nice, the presentation does not live up to the promise.  Specially after you take a look at the fake importation stamps.<br /><br />Problems with this drink:<br />- First, see the tag ""Absinthe liqueur""?  A liqueur means a spirit that has been bottled with added sugar.  Real absinthe does not come with sugar.  You are free to add it later, but it should not come with it from the manufacturer.<br />- Second, it is made with Southern wormwood (Artemisia abrotanum).  To be considered real absinthe, it has to be made with grande wormwood (Artemisia absinthium).  Substitutions in the main ingredients are not valid when talking about absinthe.<br />- Third, it is artificially colored.  Real absinthe get its color from the chlorophyll of the plants of which is made, or no color at all; even though, the green is always subtle.  Being bright lime green is in no way a good thing.<br />These three points are enough for this drink to not be considered absinthe at all.  Some other things to consider are:<br />- It is overly sweet.  It's no wonder, considering it is bottled with sugar.<br />- You only can taste anise.  No other herbal flavors, or the subtle bitterness of wormwood.  Just anise.<br /><br />However, it has some good things:<br />- It is way cheaper than real absinthe.  If you are going to try it for the first time, it can be a good substitute; so if you decide later that you don't care for it, you are not out of a lot of money - this drink comes in mini bottles too.<br />- It does louche (meaning it changes color when you add water, turning milky).  That is always fun to watch.<br />- It provides a good example of what real absinthe tastes like.  Mainly of anise.<br /><br />Overall, this can be a fine pastis or absinthe substitute.  By all means, buy a bottle and share it with your friends at a party.  Just be advised that:<br />1- It is not absinthe.<br />2- You should not gift it to your absinthe-loving friend and expect a great reaction<br />3- You should not buy it if you have or plan to have an interest in real absinthe.  This spirit just does not cut it.<br /><br />P.S. I refuse to discuss thujone content and other non-sense and myths in my reviews.  If you are interested in thujone, go eat sage and forget absinthe altogether.",2
Vibrant color. Great taste. Very easy to work with. I will definitely be using more of this product in the future.,5
"I purchased this drink and, although it did have somewhat of a good taste, little did I know that it was elevating my blood pressure.  When I went to see my doctor for my follow up appointment approx. two and a half weeks ago, I was almost admitted in the hospital with a blood pressure of 175/104.  Went down immediately after I stopped using it per my doctor's orders. Would like to return the remaining six out of the two cases brought from Amazon.com if they would kindly allow the return. Please, BEWARE!!!",3
"I love coconut so I thought this tea would be for me.<br /><br />I tasted more chocolate than coconut. Also, I didn't care for the flavor/consistency aspect- it was like drinking a weak tea that should actually be a coffee.<br /><br />I have ordered other teas from Republic of Tea and love them - this tea just wasn't for me:(",3
I have  a shih tzu Chihuahua mix and he will not eat these. I was surprised since they got great reviews..maybe my moms cat will eat them.,1
"I'm a big fan of the Blue Diamond brand almonds and I especially like the ""bold"" flavors.<br /><br />The Lime n Chili flavor is my favorite with the Habanero BBQ being a close second.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer that says the tartness of the lime flavor is just enough to bring out the chili flavor. Its a nice balance.<br /><br />I would say my only complaint is towards the end of the bag the flavor can get a little overwhelming because of all the extra spices that accumulate towards the bottom.",5
...I really should have paid closer attention before buying 3kg; they don't hold a candle to Maynard's (more expensive) product.,2
"My gf bought this for me not knowing what's in the basket.  First of all, instead of that frog you see in the picture, a cheap one dollar store stuffed animal came.  And, snacks they put in the basket would cost you no more than $10, even if you buy them at overpriced convenience stores.  They put some cheap looking imitation snacks that looked like Doritos, and they were from ""golden flakes"", a brand that i've never seen or heard.<br /><br />WORST OF ALL, I found a live COCKROACH inside the shipping box that contained this gift!!!  It was huge.  Seriously, I was going to take a picture to share customer image on amazon page, but it was just too gross.<br /><br />I feel so bad for my gf who was such a sucker to buy this crap.",1
I love it...but you can find it at sams club for $6 versus the $14 here on amazon.,5
"I purchased this tea after reading the wonderful reviews of it. I compared it to Taylors of Harrogate China Rose petal black tea. This product has lesser quality black tea, with smaller leaves. Also, The rose petals are miniscule and few and far in between, whereas the Harrogate product has much larger rose petals. The label states they added ""rose essence"" to it, so compared to the Harrogate product, it smells sort of synthetic. Not to mention, you get more tea with the Harrogate version.",2
"I have two kids, a 3 year old and a 5 year old. My 3 yr old was crazy about them (she loves veggies and she loves chips so it was the perfect combination for her. She excitedly called them ""green frenchfries!""). My 5 yr old hates peas and disliked the pungent whiff you get when you first open the bag. She was not crazy about the color. It took her a couple of tries before they grew on her (seeing her sister devour them encouraged her to give them another chance).<br /><br />These are a bit oily even though they are baked. They have a great crunch and are not too salty (but we love salt!) I think they look cool and taste good. They can be addicting! I like dippingthem in hummus.<br /><br />I don't think they are a healthy substitute for vegeatables (fat content) but a good way to introduce veggies into a veggie-hater's diet. They are in our snack cabinet and make a nice addition to a lunchbox every now and then but I don't offer them everyday.",4

"I just cannot understand the high praise these chips have received.  I ordered the variety pack and am very disappointed.  All flavors have a really weird taste to them, except for maybe the plain chips.  The salt and vinegar especially tasted gross!  I took one bite and had to throw the bag away.  Now I'm stuck with a bunch of chips that I'll never eat.",1
"I have been drinking this tea for some time.  I happen to like Chamomile teas they are very a mild, I do not like teas that are to strong.  One bag is enough or me I can put it in a cup of hot water and leave the bag in without worrying if it was to get too strong like other teas do.  Adding just a little raw honey enhances the flavor also.<br />I enjoy this tea before I go to bed and it has a very soothing and the warmth of the liquid allows me to slip into a nice sleep.<br /><br />I like the convenience of a foil package, I can carry one or two with me when I go out to lunch with friends, I just order a cup of hot water and slip this tea into it.<br />I have on occasion I have put this is a cup with some fresh ginger and it makes a totally different tea, and he ginger helps sooth the tummy while the Chamomile tends to relax you.<br />Doesn't get much better than this.",4

"There is some fault with this coffeemaker that makes it explode when washing it. I had not made coffee for 24 hrs, so it was cold when I decided to clean it with dish soap. Suddenly I heard a loud pop and the carafe was filled with glass. Luckily my hand wasn't inside and only one shard flew out - away from my face. I have no idea what caused it, but I'm thinking the carafe had some sort of flaw. I called Melitta and they have sent me a new one, but honestly, I'm kind of afraid to use it. The woman I spoke to said she had not heard of this happening, but I've found similar stories on the Internet, so it's not just me. It's a shame, because it's a very pretty coffeemaker and makes good coffee, as all Melitta pour-overs do. It's just a dangerous one.",1
"Baronet Coffee Decaf 100% Columbian Medium Roast Pods did not disappoint. They fit very nicely in either a one cup or two cup Senseo coffee maker. They brew a medium to light coffee flavor.

Everything on the ingredients label of this canned food is recognizable as real food; no ""powdered protein"" or other questionable substances.

The turkey and brown rice from Newman's Own is also excellent.",5

"I have an almost 11 month - lab weim mix - who is close to 100 lbs. When I got him he was on some high protein food from the feed store. I switched to purina puppy for large breed and he had loose stools.

I will definitely keep buying this. I can't find it locally so just get it from amazon but with free shipping, its almost easier having it delivered to my door.",5
"First, I really liked the conditioner.  It smells nice, not too strong a scent, it makes my hair feel very soft, it is nice and thick and works into my hair easily.<br /><br />The packaging, however, needs a small adjustment.  It has one of those lids that you push one side in & the conditioner comes out the other side, and the actual lid is nice and large and easy to manipulate, unlike some of the small lids, I really liked that part.  However, with this style of lid you have to squeeze the bottle to get the conditioner out.  Which is fine, except that the plastic is a little bit thick and hard to squeeze, and once the conditioner bottle got to less than half full, it gets harder and harder to squeeze out.  There's a lot of waste.<br /><br />Also, for you guys - my husband puts a little conditioner on his whiskers in the shower to soften up the whiskers before he shaves.  He didn't like this conditioner for that use at all, he said it was too thick and didn't seem to wash out of his beard well and gooped up the razor.<br /><br />In short, fine for hair, needs easier-to-squeeze plastic for the bottle, don't use for a pre-shave treatment :-)",4

I enjoy loose leaf teas...and this Oolong is lovely.  I can get three pots of tea off of one set of leaves.  (A good oolong should give you multiple pots off of one batch of leaves a lot like high quality grean tea will.)<br /><br />The flavor is delicate and flowery.  The color is that perfect oolong gold.  If you're looking for an inexpensive oolong that doesn't cost $50/lb...I highly recommend it.  Yes...there are better teas out there if you hit the gourmet shop...but if oolong is one of your everyday teas this won't disappoint.,4
"I'll admit, I'm not very handy in the kitchen. But when my child's birthday came around, I was determined to bake a cake our mostly vegan family could all enjoy. Have you ever read the label from those pre-made cakes at your grocer's bakery? They are loaded with chemicals I cannot even pronounce, let alone even begin to understand why they would be ingredients in a cake for that matter. I came across a few recipes for vegan cakes, and with a slew of ingredients I didn't have in my pantry, I figured a mix would be an easier choice. That's when I stumbled upon Cherrybrook Kitchen Cake mixes and frosting. I chose to try the yellow cake with chocolate frosting. The other reviews for the chocolate frosting were very good, and I was not disappointed. While it is true it is made up of only 3 ingredients, these pre boxed mixes are about convenience. Now that brings me back to the issue, mix called for the addition for butter or a substitute. While I read others successfully using vegetable shortening as a butter subsititute, I opted to used Willow Brook soy margarine, which made the frosting overly salty. SO i would not recommend using that. But overall, you can tell the frosting was DELICIOUS! The texture was great. We still managed to eat the whole thing even with the saltiness!<br /><br />Overall I'd highly recommend Cherrybrook's Chocolate frosting mix. It is absolutely delicious, and would be a great addition to your vegan or allergy free kitchen.<br /><br />The reason I deducted 1 star, my only complaint, with a product of this caliber, how Cherrybrook goes out of their way to maintain excellent quality standards, they should go the extra mile and make all their ingredients ORGANIC! Then it would be PERFECT.<br /><br />UPDATE: I went ahead and made the frosting again, but this time using Spectrum Naturals Organic vegetable shortening. The frosting was delicious, Very light and creamy, but it somehow lacked that flavor punch that came with making with the soy margarine. Next time around, what i plan on doing and what I would recommend to anyone using this frosting, use half shortening and half margarine. Also the frosting gets hard when it gets cold from being in the fridge, so take it out of the fridge awhile before you're going to eat it to allow it to soften.",4
"My husband is gluten sensitive, dairy sensitive, and diabetic, so it is very difficult to find desserts for him.  Usually, if it's gluten free, it has waaaay too much sugar, for example.  I tried a box of these cookies for him.  He tried them and said that they are surprisingly good.<br /><br />They are not mereingues, even though they are shaped like those types of cookies.  They are regular cookie consistency.  There are just a few in a package, so they are rather expensive.  However, they are less expensive than buying all the materials yourself and having them fail.  (Can you tell I have made some bombs in my time as a specialty cook? LOL)",4
"I ordered the 16oz Cowboy Strips Original, the product arrived promptly, and this is some of the best jerky I've had. Reminds me of a brand (long forgotten) I loved as a kid (1960's).<br />This Jerky is not too sweet and with a hard texture like Jack Links, Oberto, and the store brands. Nice salty taste, thicker strips, tender (for Jerky) texture. The one pound size is a great value too.<br /><br />I ordered two more pounds of Cowboy Strips, Pepper and Original right away.<br /><br />I hope you plan to continue to offer the 16oz bags. I will definately be a loyal customer.<br /><br />Thanks for a great product!",5
This is without a doubt the most incredibly addictive packaged cookie in the world. The dark chocolate dipping at one end is a great contrast to the rolled wafer of the cookie itself. Why did I ever buy a whole case! Bless Amazon for carrying the Bahlsen line of fabulous cookies because it is not available in Montana.,5
"I first had these on a plane.  It was nice to have something that wasn't all sugar or salt for a change when I'm trapped on a plane.  I plan to start buying them to keep in my desk at work.  As another reviewer said, they are not crispy like chips so the name is a little misleading.  They are more of a foamy or rice cake type texture.  Definately good when you are looking for a lighter, fresher snack to keep around instead of chips or candy.",4
"Oh, dear God it tastes like mothballs. I really wanted to like this product and commit to it -- so I ordered a case of the creamy chocolate fudge shakes. I previously was on the Robard products, but didn't like having to go to the doctor every week so I could get the shakes (it's doctor-supervised). Robard shakes are delicious and filling, but have a lot of unhealthy ingredients and are expensive, plus not readily accessible. When I found Orgain, I thought it'd be a great alternative because it's organic. However, if you're lactose-intolerant, beware -- it contains milk. And a very strange mediciney taste. I'm stuck with a case of this stuff -- maybe if I blend it with bananas it'll be palatable. Buy a couple of the single servings, if you can find them, before committing to a large order.",2
"I tested these treats out on three dogs, a schnauzer mix, poodle mix, and a terrier mix.  They all got very excited when I opened the bag, but the terrier was the only one who seemed very enthused about the treat itself.  The other two kind of chewed on the treats for a minute or two, then just kind of stared at them.<br /><br />The treats are a little messy, especially near the end.  My dogs left tiny crumbs on the floor, so that's something to watch out for.  They're a good size, perfect for medium build dogs.",3
"I bought this believing it was an all natural product.  When I took my first sip I thought it tasted artificial and after researching discovered that it contained sucralose. It is deceptive  not to include this information prominently on the packaging when claiming all natural flavoring. In fact I did not see it mentioned anywhere unless you read the ingredient list, where it is easy to confuse the 'sucralose' with 'sucrose' -a natural sugar.<br /><br />The advertising on the package claims to be unsweetened.  Not true, it is sweetened with an artificial sweetner.<br /><br />This is the product description on Amazon:  ""We start with pure, natural water, add carbonation and 100% fruit essences to create 10 distinctly thirst-quenching flavors."" Very misleading.",1

"Although the flavor of the coffee is good, the K-cup is not properly sealed.  The cover seal breaks when brewing, resulting in coffee grounds in the brewed coffee and coffee coffee grounds in the Keurig brewer.

The Zwieback toast had a good taste.  I compare it to the Old Nabisco zwieback and it doesn't quite measure up.  I also did not like the size of the product.  It was small in comparison to other zwieback products.  It was o.k. but I would not order again.,3

"These are pretty good. In my opinion, they aren't nearly as good as the Teriyaki Beef Steak Nuggets (which are sort of similar), but they aren't bad either. They have sort of a prime rip au-jus flavoring, but you can tell that the meat itself isn't prime rib. It's definitely work a try to see if you like it.",3
"I'm a gum fanatic, but usually I'm used to the sugary versions, or else the very minty alternatives.  I'm trying Spry for the first time, and I think it's a fantastic gum, but I feel the flavor runs out very quickly, and it also comes in very small portions.  The packaging is also frustrating, because I'm used to pushing into the tab for the gum to come out, but the packet that actually holds the gum is small compared to the sleeve, so you have to shake it out.",3
"I don't know, people seem to like this k-cup, but it just did not do it for me.  Maybe I got a bad batch, as it was simply overpowering for me.  And I do like many of the bolder k-cups, such as Midnight Magic and Rainforest Espresso, but those are simply better coffees to me.  Maybe I'll give the Emeril's regular another chance, but it did not win me over the first time around.  As a side-note, I really like the Emeril's decaf--it is much more drinkable to me than the Emeril's regular.",3
This was an excellent offer. The product is quite good. The packaging included a clear plastic bag with the individual packets all placed within a cardboard box.,4
"I bought the BBQ flavor.  From time to time you want some chips with a sandwich, or maybe just a salty snack.  The BBQ flavoring is good, but these chips are not as good as fried chips.  Frankly they don't taste good enough to keep my attention as a stand-alone snack.  I eat a few then lose interest.  I'll probably use them as a side with a sandwich.",3
I purchased the lemon flavored stevia to put in my water bottles to add flavor to my water.  I am trying to kick my crystal light habit and was hoping this would be a good replacement.  I would definitely by the product again the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the lemon flavor is pretty mild.  I know its because I'm use to stronger flavors such as crystal light but it is worth it if you are trying to cut back on your intake of other drinks and increase your water intake.,3

"I used Fresh Step and Scoop Away cat litters for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that they were the best ""bang for the buck"" litters. They clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, they form a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase one of these litters.

"We have fed our dog Purina Dog Chow and many of the Purina dog treats for years and have come to trust the Purina label. When we decided to try feeding Beneful to our dog, we started gradually, adding a little bit to his regular feeding and then increasing it gradually. We only increased to 1/4 of our dog's regular feeding when he started having problems with upset stomach and eating grass all the time and seemed to lose his appetite. We stopped feeding the Beneful and within a couple of days he was back to his old self. We decided to try again, and had the same results. I don't have a clue what makes this food intolerable to our pet, but I am truly surprised that a Purina product is causing this problem.<br /><br />Unfortunately, with these results, I cannot recommend Beneful as the healthy and nutritious food that is portrayed on the packaging.",2
I found these for 1/2 the cost on the direct website with a free gift of lava cakes as well. Makes a great gift :),3
so i tried the garlic one and i made a mistake.... and didn't wear a gas mask when i used it ... i LOVE garlic but wow this is over powering in powder form when i first got it i opened it up to give it a smell and almost fell over it was like i got mased eyes tearing up nose burning regardless i bought it im trying it and i mix up some sausage and if you add water like it says it gets toned down so you can work with it after stuffing it and letting it sit for 24hrs for the casing to firm up i grilled them and im not impressed its not bad like someone just dumped a bunch of garlic powder in my sausage and no other spices i feel like it needs more flavor then JUST garlic powder i mean even salt and pepper would be nice,3
"This bar is pretty good, but the chocolate taste is not a very true chocolate.  It has a bit of a strange aftertaste, but not unbearable.  It definitely tastes like health food, which isn't always a bad thing, if you are expecting it.  Just don't think this bar will replace your Snickers, because you will be sorely disappointed- but if you are a health nut looking for a sweet snack, give it a try.  (Maybe just buy one first, before the whole box, because I wish I had done that!!!)",4
I bought these for my disabled daughter. She has trouble keeping food and liquids down and I was buying gatorade and powerade for her. My son is a construction worker and in this extremely hot summer his construction job started handing these out to prevent heat exhaustion and heat stroke. He brought one home to his sister and it did more to improve how she felt than all of the gatorade and powerade. It contains potassium and other electrolytes that the aforementioned products do not have. And they taste a whole lot better according to her. I started looking for a place to get them and found them at Amazon. Thank God for Amazon. I now purchase them in boxes of 150 and she benefits from them greatly. She tries to get 3 a day in and can tell a great difference if she doesn't get them all in.,5
"Pros:<br />- Has chocolate in it<br />- Organic<br />- Very different<br /><br />Cons:<br />- You really cant taste any chocolate<br />- Taste is earthy as described...which tastes earthy with spice<br />- ""Nourish & Energize"" are the last adjectives I would use when describing how I feel after drinking the tea.<br /><br />I drink about 2-3 cups of tea a day, and sadly this is one tea I do not look forward to drinking.  I have let other people tried it, and they all too agreed that ""energize"" was one of the last words they would use to describe the tea.<br />However, due to the tea being very different, it does add something ""different"" for my collection.  You could call it almost a love hate relationship.<br />To sum up this tea: It tries to be something it isn't. (relating to every word used to describe the tea on its box)",3
"I thought I was getting a pure unsweetened nothing added black tea.  For those of you like me who HATE lemon in their tea beware - this tea does contain hibiscs and citric acid, probably as a preservative, but it gives it a bit of that canned lemoney nestea flavor.  Yuck.  I should have read the ingredients more closely ...",2
This product is too weak to really enjoy.  I would like a decaf with the flavor of the wonderful dark roast variety!,2
you have to try McCann.  Every morning starts off with a bowl of this traditional steel cut oatmeal that takes thirty minutes to cook.  It is so delicious.  Buying it from Amazon is convenient and easy and I can get it just before I run out.  Buying this oatmeal is a no-brainer.,5
"These crepe cookies are out of this world! I believe everyone should try these cookies at least once in their life.<br /><br />My first experience with these cookies was in a high end grocery store.  Found them to be more expensive in the grocery store, but i decided ill try them once in my life.  Now these cookies have become an obsession.<br /><br />The cookies have a flakey texture and have this lightly sweet taste that just makes my mouth water.  These crepe cookies are neatly packed into a golden wrapper with two crepe cookies.  The exterior has a wonderful golden color with a slight glaze to them.  Once a crepe cooke is in your mouth you can bite but the sweetness, which is not overpowering, just melts into your mouth.  I would recommend these to anyone who loves flavor without the crazy overpowering taste of sugar.<br /><br />I am a true believer when it comes to these cookies.  I will purchase them over and over again.  I wish there were more cookies per package.  Makes it hard to share because these cookies are so good!",5
Best tasting olive oil I have had.  It gets a little peppery at the back of your throat!  It is exceptionally delicious when making garlic & oil pasta.,5
"Fortunately, before I purchased I read through enough reviews of these k-cups to discover that they add some artificial sweetener to them along with sugar.  I'm shocked that the item descriptions don't make this clear.  I consider that important information!<br /><br />I decided to give them a try, anyway, considering some reviewers thought it was hard to tell.  I realize that many products do this recently, but they usually fall short of hiding that nasty aftertaste.<br /><br />Sadly, this one does too.  It's close - I can almost enjoy a cup - but it's still unmistakable, especially if you don't consume much artificial sweetener.  (I chew sugar-free gum, and that's it for me.)<br /><br />It's a shame, too, because the chocolate flavor is nice.  In fact, I rated these a 3 simply because my son tolerates the sweetener enough to drink them.  And I was really jazzed about the caramel cappuccino before I found out about the sweetener...but now I won't be buying any.  (Side note: many cappuccino reviewers complained that they're instant coffees that taste like gas station cappuccino - that would be fine with me, if it weren't for the artificial sweetener which those gas station cappuccinos don't have.)<br /><br />If they begin to offer a line without the artificial sweetener, I'd buy it, but until then I'm staying away from Grove Square products.",3
So I bought these to spice up my coffee.  Some taste good with coffee and some taste very artificial.  I use the hazelnut and gingerbread for coffee.  My SO uses the vanilla.  I put these in tea or protein shakes because I think they blend better with milk or something with texture.  I'm glad that they are sugar free.  I know regular syrups like the ones they use in starbucks are LOADED with calories and make it a meal instead of a drink.  Kinda defeats the purpose of drinking coffee with a healthy breakfast.  I haven't used the peppermint because I'm not a fan of minty things.,3
These were good but I like Klein's a little better as Klein's is less greasy and salty but these are good too and better than chips. Even my young kids eat them.,4

"These treats are amazing.  I moved into a new condo with new carpet and I think my cat was licking herself constantly to get the carpet fibers off.  As a result, she was having hairballs at least three to four times a week.  Brand new carpet and hairballs are not the best combination!  I tried these treats after reading all the great reviews on here.  At first, I gave her at least six everyday and they slowly started to work.  After she went a couple days without a hairball, I started to give her four every other day.  They continue to work.  These are more expensive than other treats, but they are totally worth it if your cat has issues with hairballs.  My cat won't eat these as a treat, but I just put them in with her food and she eats them right away.  AWESOME product.",5
These beans are sour! But not so sour my toddler can't eat them. They taste great also. And the little packages are only 69 calories. Great to throw in your purse or diaper bag for a snack.,5
"I thought this Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Megafudge product was pretty darn good. I was afraid that it would be too ""chocolaty"" or too sweet, but it's actually a pretty good balance. A few minor complaints is that the dough on the cookie crumbles a bit easily... especially around the edges. I would've liked it more cohesive. Also, the ""fudge"" core wasn't quite creamy enough, as far as the texture is concerned. The fudge also would've been better if it tasted more like ""dark chocolate"", but instead it tastes more like hot cocoa. Despite these observations, I think these are pretty delicious cookies and definitely worth a try.",4
I love this tea and can only find it at around the holidays.  What a great find I was able to order a large amount for a great price!,5
"I was skeptical of using a sugar free mix to make drinks, and to be sure, it's not like getting a margarita made with fresh-pressed lime juice.  But, if you drink a lot of these in the summer, give this a try. Getting rid of the guilt along with the calories makes up for the slightly bitter taste. Don't bother, though, if you have one every once in a while and enjoy the real stuff instead.",4
"These cherry tomatoes have a nice flavor although they sort of ""deflate"" if you cook them for more than a minute.<br /><br />Even out of the can, if you pop one in your mouth, it feels hollow. Hard to describe. I added these tomatoes to a pasta primavera I made the other night and had to remove them from the heat after just a minute because half of them had already started to collapse.<br /><br />I shared this order with a friend so now I'm left with 11 cans and I think I'll use most of them in pizzas or to make quick sauces. And if that works out then I'll keep the Subscribe and Save on this item, otherwise I'll have to cancel.<br /><br />I can't recommend this product because, in my opinion, the tomatoes should be firmer and not collapse like these do.<br /><br />Also, these cherry tomatoes are not peeled.<br /><br />Prompt delivery, but six of the cans arrived dented.",3
"Um, yeah, what the title says. My son just doesn't like them. But, they are an easy on the go meal... hope that helps? I will say this much: HE DOES PREFER THESE TO THE STANDARD/ STORE BRAND VARIETY. STANDARD = 'THE CHEF' (girl i x) LMAO",3
These had heat and had good enough coating of the seasoning. The first 2 cases were amazing best i had ever. Then they restocked and tried 4-5 cases and they taste either like plain chips or slight hint of seasoning on them. What a shame they seemed to cut back on quality to save money. Bad Uncle Ray!,1
"Kashi Go Lean Crunch is the best cold cereal I've even eaten.  Besides, it's actually good for you.",5
"Amazon just cancelled the 1L 2-pack of this good oil via subscribe & save @ 18.71 for my last shipment. That is 67 oz's of oil. Now it's 51 oz's for 22$ in subscribe & save, that is an increase from 0.28$ per OZ to 0.43$ per oz -- about 30% increase in price. Not anywhere as good a deal as it was before. This is good middle of the road, organic olive oil, been using it for last 2-3 years. But it's getting way to pricey for what it is.<br /><br />Maybe it's not Amazon - maybe it's the supplier price increase -- but it is a sad turn of events.<br /><br />Just read a bunch of articles about how low olive oil prices are hurting europe -- sounds like gouging to me.",1
"When I was growing up, we would visit my grandparents in the summer. They had a place in town, but also had a cabin up in the mountains that we'd stay at on occasion. At this cabin there was a lovely old spring house which my grandfather had built in his youth from stones found around the property. The spring house was built right into the side of the mountain where a natural, pure spring flowed all year round. The spring house had a large, thick wooden door with a huge iron latch which opened with an old key. The door would open and you would need to step down onto a concrete step which was in front of an even lower concrete pool, filled with water. On the opposite wall was a large, wooden cork attached to the stone wall with a chain. This stopped up the spring, but if the pool got low, you could remove the cork and clear water would rush out and fill it up again. There was a pail and a dipper, both were the old-fashioned speckled blue enamel. Occasionally, you would see a salamander or a spider there, but the spring house was one of my favorite places to be in the summer, dark and cool. And the water was extremely pure, very cold and very sweet. The only taste it had was a slight mineral taste. I'd give someone a hundred dollars right now just to have a gallon of that water again.<br /><br />This product shares none of these qualities and had a slight plastic aftertaste for me. Basic, bottled water here, folks.",3
"SWITCH isn't a bad product, but it's not great either.  I like the fact that it's all natural sparkling juice.  The can design is pleasant to look at.<br /><br />I thought the Black Cherry flavor tasted a bit too apple-ly, but my wife really liked the flavor.  Also, at 130 calories per can, this beverage has almost 50% more calories per ounce than the average soda.  Too many for me.",3
These are probably the best chips I've ever had.  What blows me away more is the fact it's all good ingredients.  10/10 hands down.,5
"After receiving these today, I gathered the household testers together (aka, the missus and munchkins) to try these cookies.  First, let me describe them.  They are about the circumference of a normal oreo.  On the inside is one chocolate oreo-type cookie, about 1/2 the width of a normal oreo cookie, with a thin layer of creme on one side.  Then the entire cookie is covered with a chocolate/fudge.  Althogther, they're slightly smaller than the typical two cookies with creme inside oreo cookie you're used to seeing.<br /><br />The testers and I agree that they taste pretty good.  The cookie on the inside has a bit of snap to it when you bite into it, and the creme and fudge work well together.  And of course, almost anything tastes better when its covered with chocolate.  I won't go into the ingredients here, but a single serving of 3 cookies has 170 calories.<br /><br />This is an interesting new product from Nabisco, and I like it.  Five stars.",5
Sadly these arrived melted beyond recognition. I will NOT purchase again from this vendor. Either they are stored improperly or shipped improperly.<br /><br />i have now discarded ALL 6 of these boxes AND discovered that I can buy properly stored and shipped Milk Duds at a lower price.,1
"I saw all the positive reviews so I thought I'd give this a try since it's a bit cheaper than my other favorite brands. Unfortunately, I'll have to disagree with the other reviewers, for the following reasons:<br /><br />1) To me, this doesn't taste like jasmine blossoms. Instead, it tastes and smells like artificial banana flavoring -- like what you'd find in banana-flavored chewing gum or Jelly Bellies. I don't even care for real bananas all that much, so this is definitely not a good thing.<br /><br />2) Speaking of flavoring -- the list of ingredients says ""Organic Jasmine Green Tea and Organic Flavor."" What the heck is ""Organic Flavor""? Oh, they must mean ""organic artificial-banana flavoring."" ;)<br /><br />3) The strings of the tea bags are attached to the bag with a mini-staple. First off, I'm not too keen on the idea of brewing metal staples along with my tea. Second, one of the strings detached from its bag because the staple didn't hold it in place well enough -- and this happened the very first time I tried this tea. The detached string was a minor annoyance, but what if the staple itself detached from the bag and into the tea? It's small enough that it could be inadvertently swallowed.<br /><br />I think it's worth paying a little more for these (both of which I've tried and like):<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028SWA7S"">Choice Organic Whole Leaf Organics Jasmine Green Tea Pyramids, 15-Count, 1.05-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E20E"">Rishi Tea Organic Jasmine Pearl Loose Leaf Tea, 2.99-Ounce Tin (Pack of 2)</a>",2
"As I reported when I received my order, it was supposed to be in a pack of 12, well someone needs to send me the other two packs as I only received 10, so I will not be ordering this item from here anymore, I will be taking my business elsewhere.",3
"I order pack of those when is onsales, it was very poor pack the bag almost fall out from the box.  I read good review hope is good, i was wrong, i only able to eat 1 box out 3 box i brought, is just not good period, tasted below average, nothing too special, it does tasted like fry and very oily, very mislead.  I think the contain is not correct is far higher.  I rather eat chips than this !",1
"I need to order these online because my local store stopped carrying them, and now I cannot live without this incredible taste I discovered: Heat up a sweet potato (only about 6 minutes in the microwave). Split it open and drizzle olive oil (a little fat helps you absorb the vitamins in the sweet potato - high quality olive oil tastes best) and place a chipotle bouillon cube inside. Mash it up thoroughly inside the skin with a fork. Aside from the level of sodium, which you can adjust based on how much of the cube you want to use, this is a pretty healthy snack, and tastes incredible! (kind of like gourmet sweet potato fries) The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I cannot vouch for the healthiness of the cube or what it's made from, but I can tell you this makes for some serious deliciousness!",4
"First I tried Diamond's almond milk in vanilla and unsweetened and sweetened chocolate flavors. The vanila is fine if you like almonds, I'm not wild about them. The unsweetened chocolate was undrinkable for me, and the chocolate was OK.<br /><br />Then I found the Pacific hazelnut, in plain and chocolate. I love hazelnuts. The plain in good, and the chocolate is terrific for a non-dairy milk.<br /><br />Unfortunately the three grocery stores I go to regularly don't have the hazelnut in either plain or chocolate so I am baffled where I got it. Now I will buy it from Amazon. I like that Amazon has the 8 oz. size, which I didn't know about.",5
"I almost didn't try this because I bought the Walden Farms chocolate sauce and marshmallow sauce several years ago and they were awful.  But thanks to Amazon reviews, I decided enough people liked the salad dressings that I should give them a chance.<br /><br />I found this at my local Fred Meyer (Kroger family) for a few pennies over $5.  The FM stores in Boise have a little diet food section, and that's where I found it.  I bought the Bacon Ranch, and I must say it's pretty good.  I had a full bowl of salad with plenty of dressing (I like lots!) for just 20 calories.  Very cool!<br /><br />I wonder how this would taste on shiritaki (yam) noodles?  I think I'll try that tomorrow.",4
The only redeeming quality about this product is that the ingredients are all-natural. It tastes just plain horrible! I cannot recommend it to anyone.,1
These 5 star reviews are likely written by somebody paid by Nabisco. These things are definitely NOT sheer indulgence. Crazy. Dry as sand... outer chocolate covering is just weird... strange flavor... just don't expect much.,3
"I was very excited to find a natural ingredient cookie mix (we love cookies but are often short on time) but VERY disappointed in the results.  The cookies have a slightly odd texture which could be overlooked, however they have no flavor.  Even the chocolate chunks are bland.  I added vanilla to the second batch which helped a little.",2
"These Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies are really not that.  They are large and securely packaged in a re-closeable package.  However, they are not really chewy, just sorta crumbly. Gooeyness seems to imply that they are hot from the oven or short from loads of butter, and I didn't find them to possess that quality. They taste of cheap chocolate and the chips are not any different in flavor from the dough part.  They might be gooier if you left them in a hot car or something.  If you like this brand then you might like them, otherwise I would choose something else.",2
I love this powder for the ease of use. It is great for hot or cold drinks and has reach taste and flavor. Great quality as Chirardelli always do.,5
"Dissapointed with ingredient list. Because this is marked Organic i would expect ingredient list to be ""prunes"", but it includes tuna oil. Won't be buying. Enough said.",1
"I love Flake. I get it whenever I go to Ann Arbor, as the World Market down there is the closest place that sells it (an hour and a half drive for me). So I know what this is supposed to taste like, and...this is not it.<br /><br />The candy is stale. I would think this is a seller problem, not Cadbury's...but according to Amazon I'm wrong about that (as I tried to leave seller feedback about the state of the candy).<br /><br />The thing is, not all of the bars were stale. Also, I've purchased a six pack of these before at World Market, and the six bars came in a packaging clearly made for them. It had the nutritional information on the back, the design on the front, etc. These bars came in a clear plastic wrap container with a big white sticker that said 'Flake 6 Count.' Clearly not the original packaging.<br /><br />I wont purchase again. I'll hold out for a trip to Ann Arbor. So much for saving myself the hassle.<br /><br />EDIT: Just wanted to add...there's some arabic writing on the packaging. Maybe I never noticed before, but I've never seen this on Flake purchases I made in an actual store. Just a big disappointment all around.",2
"There is a reason that they call this ""Talking Rain"" seltzer.  It is one of the loudest cans of carbonated beverage that I have ever opened.  Since I love very carbonated water, I think this is great!<br /><br />However, if it's possible to switch to a home carbonation system, I'd recommend that.  I'm a bit worried about consuming so much trace aluminum.  That's the reason I gave it four stars - because I think it's worth going for carbonated water that doesn't have aluminum or BPA exposure as a required part.",4
"CHANTEA ALOE VERA GREEN TEA, Passion fruit 11.5 ounce.<br /><br />I loved the taste of this tea, but you must drink it very cold, and make sure you really shake the bottle before you drink it as the tea is at the bottom of the bottle.<br /><br />I buy Lipton green tea with citrus for my teenage daughter and this product is very comparable.  They both have almost the same ingredients (citrus vs passion fruit in this case) and have almost the exact number of carbs and sugar.  The differences between them are the CHANTEA has a much richer tea flavor vs the Lipton.  If you are a green tea lover you would certainly prefer this over the other brands. The aloe pulp may put people off but, I liked it.  I also drink orange juice with pulp so maybe thats why. I didnt love the passion fruit but will definitely try the other flavors. The other major difference is the price.  A 24 pack of Lipton green tea with citrus is about .50 a bottle (16.9oz) vs the CHANTEA which comes in 8 packs at about 2.00 each (11.5oz).<br /><br />Pros- The flavor is much richer and closer to real green tea. I would classify this as a more grown up tea drink.<br />Cons- The price is much higher than other comparable brands.<br /><br />If you go to Starbucks for your daily iced tea this would be a value for you.  If, like me, you buy a case of a similar product and are ok with the taste, this probably would not appeal to you.",3
"While these K-Cups worked fine in the system, our tea drinkers found the result to be much too weak to be enjoyable.  ""Tea-colored water,"" was what one person said.  We don't know if this is really a problem with the particular product, or simply that the duration of the water flow through the cup is too short to allow the tea to steep properly.",2
"Excellent flavor.  Great choice if you are looking for a taste that is not overpowering, yet still robust enough to get that great cup of coffee.",4
"These are delicious, boneless, skinless sardines.  I eat them for a light, healthy dinner.",5
"I love this product.  Best taste, texture and nutrition in an all natural bar.  I just started regular monthly shipment of 2 cases from Amazon.  First shipment arrived with the chocolate melted and it is a real pain to eat.  Amazon's fault not Kind's.  Even after putting them in the fridge to harden up the coating.  I receive my next shipment in a week and will let you know if shipping is a problem",3
"Our source for this dog food went out of business. It was highly recommended by our dog trainer and wasn't out of line on cost. We couldn't find it anywhere and I jokingly asked my wife to check at Amazon. To our shock, you had it, at the same price and you had it delivered right to our front door, all at the same price.  Unreal.",4

"I think these are my new favorite gummy candy (and I'm addicted to gummies). Well at least my favorite sour gummy candy. Normally like their centipedes but last batch shipped out and was completely different from normal. If that's a ""new recipe"" or something I may have to switch to these fantastically addicting, mouth-watering treats. ONLY downside is that you only get about 3.75lbs for the same price you can get other bulk Haribo gummies in 5lb bags for. Likely due to the fact they come individually packaged...but if they put out a full on ""bulk"" 5lb bag for the same price it would be one of the sweetest deals on gummies around.",4
"As far as treat dispensing toys go, this is by far the best design. My 2 boxers love to bat things with their hands, and this thing takes quite some time for them to empty of kibble. The down side is this is my second one, I had the smaller version before and they managed to crack the bottom so that the toy was useless. The last one didn't last long, but I let them use it on concrete so I know that was a big factor. I think this new one will last quite a while as long as I allow them to play only on carpet. My boys use their hands exclusively to play with this thing; if your dogs tend to use their mouths and throw things up into the air I doubt this toy will last.<br /><br />I would love to see a version of this made out of aluminum. The dogs smell the treats, so it's not really necessary for the toy to be transparent. I would gladly pay the extra cost to have one of these made of aluminum, or carbon fiber, or something that I know they could use for a while and not worry about breaking.",4
"I tend to try a lot of jerky-type snacks and this product is a treat for sure! It was my first taste of these Jim Beam snack products, so I didn't know what to expect - but the texture and taste really stood out right from the start. The ""glaze"" is probably what makes this so decadent, it almost feels greasy to the touch -  but the taste is just so addictive. I usually end up eating the whole bag at once, so buying this 3-pack is definitely the way to go.",5
"If you are looking for fresh, organic coffee roasted to perfection, Basecamp coffee is definitely worth a try! This is the most consistent, quality roast I've found by far. Living in Seattle, that is no easy task as I am surrounded by the king of coffee's. Yet Backcountry Coffee roasters comes through with an amazingly bold Espresso roast. I highly recommend this product... you won't be disappointed!",5
Good coffee just not my style.  I gave it a try with the reviews but it's not for me.  I would give it 5 stars for the aroma!!,3
"OK, so my dog loves this and she is a picky eater.  I literally had to force her mouth open and give a roll of it on her tongue and she has been hooked ever since.  I usually only give her high quality treats and chews but I figure a few licks of this roll on won't her her.  I don't think I will buy it because it really is not a healthy treat for her but since she likes it and it does not make a mess I gave it 4 stars.  If it was better nutritionally I would have given it 5 stars.  This is definitely a great concept!  I just wish is contained better ingredients.  : )",4

"This cereal is surprisingly tasty considering it consists of just brown rice grits.  It is quick and easy to prepare also.  With being gluten free, it is nice to have this as a breakfast option.  gardenlady",5
"If you plan on making a pitcher of tea, forget it, it takes 4 packs for 64 oz and is still very, very weak, and it must be consumed in 12 hours (so they say) so you're much better off brewing your own.<br /><br />However if you're idea is to ""stash"" this in your purse (for the ladies) or pocket (for men which would be weird) it's just okay.  One packet does little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHo drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature?  Also, with only 8 packets (the raspberry pom) in a box, that gives you 4 16 oz drinks for $3.  Not sure it's worth it at all, I'd rather drink lemon water when out than this, equally as bland but free.",2
I ordered some of these and some pbj sahale snacks. The PBJ is great! This product though it honestly tastes like vomit or something of similar taste enjoy if you like that taste!,1

"VIA Italian Roast tastes burnt.  Since its a new product, Starbucks take notice: the 50pc half-filled non-descript recycled box packaging it comes in is really lame; It came crushed in the order. Moreover, the packets do not tear fully at the perforated line.<br /><br />Instead, try the VIA Colombia and VIA Mocha flavors. The packaging is the same but the flavor is rich and smooth and tastes brewed.",2
"I love me the regular Mi-Del Ginger Snaps... but out of a fluke I picked me up a gluten free bag once and thought it tasted not so yummy.  like ginger flavored sweetend hard dirt.  so unless you have to have the gluten free for some reason go get you the normal ginger snaps which as of Sep 2006, Amazon offers",3

"I found these to be flavor-free.  They tasted like white flour, the snickerdoodle ones I bought had hardly any cinnamon.  True disappointment, my kids will not eat them and I bought a whole box. Tastes like sweet, baked flour and water.<br /><br />However the chocolate chip ones are good.",3

I am no stranger to health foods and even use almond flour often.  I don't know what I was expecting but these have a strange consistency and flavor.  They are gummy and hard to chew which makes you think they have a lot of honey -- yet they are strangely NOT sweet.  It's like an unsweetened granola bar.  I am not a fan.  They sent a sample of the carob cookie which I thought was nice but we didn't care for that one either.  Maybe it's just not our bag.,1
"I first had B&M beans in the 1960s. They were pretty decent for a canned bean. The current version tastes nothing like the 1960s version.<br /><br />I doubt they were using high fructose corn syrup when they began making beans in the 1920s either. I also suspect that the ingredients they are hiding by using the words ""spice"" and ""natural flavor"", were not used in the 1920s. And if ""spice"" and ""natural flavor"" are healthy ingredients, they should be proud to tell us what they are.",1
looks good from the package but doesn't taste good at all.  hard crunchy freeze dried flavor.<br />save your money guys!,1

"I worked with my dogs on this toy for several days. Using it as an interactive toy we played tug, and the rubber stopper became wedged tightly so that it sealed the hole, trapping the kibble inside. The goodies inside would only fall out when the rubber stopper and straw was in a very specific position, AND the straw-like piece had grabbed the treat and pulled it through the hole, AND the bottle had to be upside down. This was something that my dogs could not possibly do with their mouth, tongue, and feet. They would pick it up by the rubbery end, sniffing and chewing at the rubbery purple parts, making it impossible to use gravity to allow the tiny treats to fall out, let alone accomplish the amazing ""straw grabber"" feat described above. Of course with no reward the motivation waned. Even my highly intelligent dog got frustrated and then became indifferent. After I had left the room for 10 minutes, my other dog had chewed up the purple rubber stopper and straw, and transformed the already useless toy into just a bottle with a small hole and no rubber stopper. Don't waste your money. I'm not impressed with the other two toys (by this maker) that I bought: busy bouncy bone, and busy bristle bone. (see my other reviews)",1
"I want to use a butter flavor in (very warm) oil-for-popcorn-topping and in (hot) baking.<br /><br />Although this product implies it is for baking, the actual packaging does not use the phrase pictured, and it adds the words 'Sensitive to heat and Light'. The packaging now says 'Artificial Flavor Butter'. The ingredients are: 'Vegetable or Soya Oil, Diacetyl, Butric Acid, Esters, Vanillan.'<br /><br />I will try again, but my (only, single) experience was to add it to very warm organic coconut oil and pour it over popped white organic popcorn; the result was an odd flavor and a sweetening effect.<br /><br />My main focus is to buy/try something else altogether, but I will try this product again after trying coconut-oil-only to see if it is the 'sweet culprit'.<br /><br />I usually have butter, but was looking for ways to increase coconut oil in my diet [...]",2
"I ordered three (ugh!) of these sampler packages intended as gifts to people to whom I had previously given Keurig's.  What a disppointment to see that they come in distasteful brown paper bag packaging with a 90 day expiration sticker right on the front!

Buyer beware!",1
"Our three cats throw up every day and have been doing this for years. I am not talking about hairballs but vomiting up undigested food. The vet says they are very healthy but ""cats do this"".<br /><br />Last week we switched from ""Purina One"" to ""Newman's Own Organics Adult Formula Dry Cat Food"" and low and behold the vomiting completely stopped -OVERNIGHT!<br /><br />Prior to ""Purina One - Urinary Track Health Formula"" we fed them ""Prescription Diet c/d"" with the same vomiting.<br /><br />One caveat -the chicken in this Newman's Organic dry cat food is ""Natural"" and not ""Organic"" so I contacted Newman's Own to ask them what they feed their ""Natural"" chickens. We received a quick response from L.Phillips Brown, DVM, confirmed that even though they are not Organic chickens, they do NOT feed these free-range chickens GMO grains.<br /><br />We recently learned that since the mid-90s, food companies have been slipping GMOs into human and animal food, without our knowledge or approval, even though studies say these are quite harmful (causing damage to internal organs). The Europeans are smart enough to ban GMOs but not us ""dumb Americans"". So unless it is organic you are best to avoid all non-Organic meat, poultry, and ""farm raised"" fish (they are all fed GMOs) and non-Organic corn, soy, cottonseed, Canola products (these are GMO).<br /><br />Perhaps this cat food stopped the vomiting issue because Newman's Own has no GMOs or perhaps it is because there are no grains. In either event, it works. And this is nothing short of a miracle! We are astonished that the change was so immediate.<br /><br />All three cats love this food. The cats have not vomited once since we switched. Also, the cats seem calmer and their food cravings - to have their bowls constantly filled - have gone away.<br /><br />We really lucked on to something here. What a great cat food!",5
"The coffee is good but not great. The package is supposed to be vacuum packed but this one was not. Seems like leaky vacuum bags are a problem at Lavazza.

"So far I've tried this product in two recipes.  The first, a balsamic vinegar and olive oil dressing, tasted rather good until the whole concoction congealed into a gloppy mess - probably my fault rather than that of the product - I may have used too much balsamic vinegar.  I also tried it as a spice rub on boneless skinless chicken breasts, and that was quite delicious.  The ""spices"" (mostly unidentified on the label) are a zesty mix of mainly Italian herbs with a pinch of sea salt, and while the product is flavorful, I wouldn't say it's significantly better than other spice mixes on the market, like the Mrs. Dash line.  The price seems a bit steep at more than $5.00 a bottle, but a little does seem to go a long way, and it promises to be a fairly versatile product.  I'll probably try it next, on the recommendation of another reviewer, as a pasta toss.",4
"Many many moons ago, I was a big Crystal Light fan, back when all they had were lemonade and pink lemonade in the little tubs that made a whole pitcher.  They've expanded their product line over the years, but they lost me way back then, though I can't recall any reason other than general apathy.  Anyway, this sounded like an interesting variant, still with the whole-pitcher format, so I tried it.<br /><br />My verdict is that it's really really sweet, with that extra-special artificial sweetener tang and aftertaste.  It was hard to drink at full strength, and I usually felt even thirstier about 20 minutes later.  However, it made an OK low-cal margarita mix with some tequila.  When half the pitcher was gone I filled it up again with more water, and it's much more drinkable now.  The artificial sweetener taste is still there, but not so noticeably.  I personally wouldn't get it again, but I'm one of those freaks who thinks plain ol' filtered water is fine as is, or add a squeeze of real lemon or lime to jazz it up.",3
"I found these cups to have a smooth, surprisingly powerful taste.  They make a great addition to the other dark, bold roasts I tend to favor, but seem to be a little less bitter than some.  Overall, very enjoyable coffee.",5
"It looks pretty healthy and with real meat, but the only problem is that my cat doesn't enjoy it at all, he doesn't really want to eat it. I don't know why, maybe it's not tasty.",1
Not as smooth a taste as I expected.  Not comparable to Tully's house blend bought at a Tully's coffee shop in Seattle.,3
"With a fudge interior, you would expect there to be some awesome chocolate flavor floating through it.<br /><br />Well there's flavor alright. It's just a processed, chemical-ridden conception of chocolate. And the dough (if you can call it dough) melts like gruel in your mouth.<br /><br />I guess these would be great when the nuclear fallout happens. Not only would they survive the apocalypse but would remind me of the days when we could actually eat chocolate, not some processed lab junkie's idea of what chocolate might taste like.<br /><br />The second star is for their nutritional value during the fallout. If I need to reach a 1000 calories a day to survive, eating 6 of these would bring me halfway there.",2
"The bars weren't bad, but they were a little too sweet for my taste especially when you get about 1/2 way through.  But the quality of the bars are good and there're big chunks of macadamia nuts which I thought were the best part.",3
"These are good, though a bit too salty for my taste. But you can get these for about 40% less at any grocery store. Save your money!",2
"I can't say whether or not these have any true health promoting effects (except for my skeletal issues I'm a healthy specimen), but I like the idea of using salt that comes from an ancient source and has micro nutrients in it, and I've used this in cooking.<br /><br />Big caution though, the product is MUCH saltier than regular salt, so be careful before you add it or sprinkle it on something!",4
"While this bar (Almond Walnut Macadamia with Peanuts) is really tasty, I was surprised by the misleading description because Peanuts are actually the first ingredient (you have to lift the marketing flap on the packaging to discern the actual ingredients), yet they say ""Almond Walnut Macadamia + Protein with Peanuts"". Their description would tend to let you think peanuts are way down on the list. Shame on you - how Kind is that? Just rename it for what it is.",3
"These do not cook up in 15 minutes, which is the main reason I bought them. In addition to the longer cook time, you have to add time to sort through the beans to find the ones that didn't sprout. After cooking, the unsprouted ones will be more brightly colored and smaller than the sprouted ones, since they are nowhere near cooked through.  The unsprouted ones are like rocks; they might damage your teeth. My recommendations is that you eat these carefully, even after sorting out the unsprouted ones.",3
"Had this oatmeal in Vermont and really liked it.  If you like natural, chewy oatmeal, you will love this.  I use brown sugar for sweetener and I use water instead of milk.",4
"VERY poor taste - or no taste would be a better phrase. Has a watered down taste, not an italian roast at all!",1
"I have been using Decaf Senseo Coffee Pods for about three years.  Since I drink one cup of coffee in the morning and no one else in my household drinks coffee, it is more economical to make one cup of coffee at a time.<br />Each cup costs about $0.50 and it's less expensive to buy through Amazon than at the super market.",4
Not really the best tea but not awful either. It is good if you just feel for a cup of tea and don't have anything else.,4
"My goodness the price of  Gold  is really up high. I can`t understand why prices vary  a lot from  state to state ,it seems the more one state is better off than a less to do state the more  you pay for everything ,in  this state  that is far better off .There is something wrong with  prices ,how they can change so much from  place to place ,in my opinion this should be illegal .when i saw what  $60.00  dollars bought  here  for noodles ,I thought  I would die. you  can by everything here  for under $15.00  your  Maruchan Ramen noodles ,36/30z  I can buy  here for $6.00 .and so forth.",3
"At first, I was excited when I found this product, but that excitement wore off quickly... A juice-based energy drink?! Sounds great! I'm not a soda drinker and can't stand carbonation. Another thing which I can't stand, is the awful taste of this drink! I don't even know if it is effective as an energy drink because I couldn't ever manage to finish a whole can of the stuff. The first sip I took was utterly putrid. I tried mixing it with some mango nectar to cut out the terrible taste, but you shouldn't have to dilute your beverages to make them easier to consume!<br /><br />Save yourself (and your taste buds!) the horror and don't buy this drink. I have tried over 20 different energy drinks and this is the most foul one of them all! Ick.",1
"Good and good for you. I got them to add to my daily oatmeal, but have found myself snacking on them a lot more often than that. A nice flavor. If you like cherries, raisins, or dried fruit, you'll enjoy these.<br /><br />These are also a great addition to trail mix.",5
The coffee seems to be going over quite well with our office- I haven't received any complaints yet!  K-Cups are SO convenient and the products are so easy to use.,4
"organic, antioxidant & omega-rich, air-dried venison, and loaded with recommended essential vitamin & nutrients...ZiwiPeak is definitely one of the best dog food products on the market!!  and I feel good giving my dog human grade quality food that's minimally processed and supports his raw food diet as nature intended.",5
"My order arrived on time.  I bought this for friends at work.  It was good, as far as taste, but this time the licorice was a bit harder than usual.  What always got me about Lucky Country Licorice was the soft texture, but this time I was disappointed that it seemed a bit hard.",4
"Well, it just came yesterday, 100 tea bags of Windsor, supposed to be the best. I made a pitcher of 20 tea bags by boiling the water, boiling again, letting it sit, putting a tea bag in my mouth and sucking and see if it would numb it. No not noticible at all, no wonder its legal in the US, stupid Coca tea! I heard if you put 3 in your mouth and suck on it for a while it will get numb, but I don't feel like doing that. I'm on my 3rd cup of iced tea today and I think I'm gonna just get a sugar-free monstor or drink expresso. Do I feel stimulated? Slightly. Do I feel sober? Yes. Alert? Yes. Energetic? Not particularly, and the fact its 65 degrees in the house doesn't help, I like warmth. Is it real Coca leaves? Yes, but dried and apparently from my research it would take 100 bags to equal 1 gram of coke. Does that mean 100 bags of fresh? I dont know. Why is it legal? Because there are not enough alkaloids in the tea to be considered an illegal substance, kinda like poppy seeds or the essence of coca you will see in the ingredients of coca-cola. It's also known to calm the cravings of cocaine users, although I don't have cravings any way, but if you do it's recommended.<br /><br />I'm now brewing one cup with 3 bags and seeing if I can tell anything...I pour the boiling water on the 3 bags. It has a nice green grassy color, similiar to green tea. It's quite delicious and as I drink it down my mood is slightly lifted, heart beat increases, but no more than with caffeine. Is it like cocaine? No, not at all and if you buy the tea hoping it's going to be that way, you've got another thing coming and will be very disappointed. I knew all this before I decided to try this. I'm not disappointed, yet not entirely enthusiastic about it either.<br /><br />It's a good alternative for thoughs who don't like coffee, it has a vast amount of vitamins, minerals and health benefits and is certainly better for you than caffeine. Also, surprisingly, no jitters like with coffee. Is it like doing a drug? No, not at all, I feel completely sober, yet my spirits are lifted a bit and a slight tingle, but it could be b/c I'm trying to feel something. I can see why it would be legal in the U.S not to mention it helps the trade commission in a safe legal way. And I'm not just saying that to keep it legal, everything I read about it not being anything like a drug has been true. I just didn't know until I tried it.<br /><br />After drinking the entire pitcher I was very giddy, but that was probably just the mood I was in naturally.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? Probably not, it's rather expensive. I'll just drink my cuban expresso, I like caffeine better than coca tea.",3
"I found the Pietro dressing at a food show years ago and was so annoyed that I couldn't find it in stores. Now, thanks to Amazon it's available on line delivered to my door! Here's how I first got hooked. The demonstrator had a bowl of lettuce. He put two pieces of the cut up lettuce in a small cup and then added TWO DROPS of this dressing on top. I tasted it and it was HEAVEN! It has a VERY high fat content but that's not BAD. The secret is to use just a LITTLE. Don't just ""pour it on"". The flavor is so intense that you will taste it immediately. This is my favorite flavor of the 4 they offer. Miso & Ginger come next. Even the Pickled Plum is interesting.<br /><br />The company ships fast and has A-1 Customer Service. With the convenience of ordering on line, you don't need to search. Thank God for the internet.<br /><br />Steve",5
"I purchased this because I had cravings for Slim Jims and read a review claiming that these were similar to Slim Jim. Well, I just received it and after one bite I realized these were NOTHING like Slim Jim. They taste like plain old boring beef sticks with jazzier packaging. Slim Jim is an institution and this is a pizz poor imitation, if in fact that's what they were going for. These might be healthier but nothing comes close to the distinctive taste of SJ. So if you want SJ, snap in to a SJ!!!!!!!!",3
"Taste is too sweet and not garlicky, to me. Also, it is named Gilroy Farms, but the label does not indicate the origin of the garlic. I think it just says packed in CA or USA. When I called and emailed about this I got no answer from McCormick, the company that distributes the product. I will not buy any more. There are other products on Amazon that give the country of origin without having to wait for answers that never come!",2
"This is good tasting tea at a decent price.  My only problem is not really with the tea but probably me, if I drink green tea on an empty stomach, sometimes I turn green myself.  Nausea eventually goes away, just have to remember not to drink it on an empty stomach.",4
"I chose this food for my dog because it was the only one without a ""filler"" ingredient high in the list.  Although I've been feeding cheaper brands to dogs in the past, I've since learned about the potential pet health impacts of doing so.  Overall, it's working out but not as well as it could be with my picky eater.<br /><br />My dog's a fan of several different varieties of the kibble, but *not* the LifeSource Bits (the little brown kibbles that have all the antioxidants that are one of the main benefits).  He picks them out and will only eat them when he's *really* hungry.  I've read plenty of reviews on pet-oriented sites about dogs who do the same.<br /><br />If your dog is not a picky eater, the kind who never finds the pill you hide in the food, you'll probably have no issues with this brand.  If your dog picks out the ""bits,"" you may have to feed him a little less or choose a different brand.",4
"All around good product. Coffee is tasty at a good price. Also, the K cup containers have less plastic so they are supposed to be less harmful for the environment.",5
"This is my favorite spicy mustard.  After a trip to London, I couldn't eat any other mustard.  When the product arrived I was very excited, but noticed there was a label covering the expiration date.  I peeled it back and sure enough the mustard had expired in January.  I still opened it hoping that there was nothing wrong with it.  I've eaten enough of this mustard to know when it doesn't taste right.  This did not taste right.  I suggest you order from a different seller",1
"At 410 calories, this is more a meal than a snack, but it's good for when you're on the go or need a quick lunch at work.  It's shelf-stable, self-contained, and easily fits in a purse or briefcase.  You get a small packet of gluten-free crackers, a tube of hummus (a bit thin and a tad sour for my taste, but I've gotten used to it), a packet of sweet-hot nuts and fruit, a packet of dry roasted edamame (you a drink to wash it down), and a square of Terra Nostra chocolate.  Best of all, it's suitable for vegans.<br /><br />I hope GoPicnic can make more vegan box meals like this.",4
"This is not espresso, people, it's regular coffe with a medium-to-dark grind; great for breakfast or any time of the day, smells great, has body and a great taste if you are a coffee connoisseur. The only problem with Lavazza is that you end up drinking more coffee! I have this, decaf and espresso and love them all!",5

"though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed.  i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results.  the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes.  still nothing.<br /><br />i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck.  i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.<br /><br />as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did",1

"Started to order Chocolate Malt Ovaltine on here, but read some reviews first.  Then went to my cupboard to see what I had, as it still tastes like the real thing.  Well, I'd had several jars on hand, all with the new look, but now I'm using the second-to-last jar, and it has the new design, but doesn't say ""New Improved Recipe"".  Still good.  However, I always try to keep an open mind.  Decided to open the last jar which says ""New Improved Recipe"" on it, had some last night, and it had the worst, fishy-tasting, disgustingly awful flavor!  Will be calling Nestle right away to beg for the original recipe back. Needless to say, I won't be buying any until they do. (Their phone number is on the jar 800-442-0099 M-F 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern) OR OvaltineUSA.com<br /><br />Update: Just spoke with a Nestle rep. He says the vanilla they used in the batch I had was too strong, and they now have corrected that.  We'll see.  Also, he bragged that the new recipe has 12 vitamins (as opposed to the old recipe's 8 vitamins)  I had to point out to him that the new recipe may have 12 vitamins, but they all have only 10% of the RDA, whereas, of the old recipe's 8 vitamins, 5 had 45% of RDA, 1 had 50%, 1 had 60%, 1 had 15%, and they also list Calcium & Phosporous as 8% each (so that's 10 added vitamins).  He said he would tell the ""marketing"" person what I said.  I had hoped he'd tell the cook!  I'll try another jar with the coupon he's sending me, and then post an update.",1
"Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile.  I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you like chamomile tea, this is a good choice.",4

"It was okay for about 30 seconds then most of the flavor had gone and the gum was hard to chew. It also started to get an off taste. I was hoping it was going to be good, I have tried the mints and there pretty good, different but good. I would agree with another reviewer that it's like chewing on a piece of rubber.",2

"Look up ""fiber one"" and ""Chicory root extract"", also known as inulin.<br /><br />I had a few Fiber One bars at a conference a few years ago, and I was out of commission for several days, ruining my conference.  This past week, my wife bought me the Fiber One raisin bran.  I normally eat regular Fiber One and mix it with another cereal to give it some flavor, and I've never had problems with Fiber One cereal in the past.  Not so with the raisin bran, which unlike regular Fiber One, contains chicory root extract (aka inulin).<br /><br />The stomach cramps this weekend were killing me, and I thought I had food poisoning.  It was only after reading the ingredients this morning (monday) that I realized it was the chicory root in the Fiber One raisin bran cereal.  I can't believe the FDA allows this as an ingredient.<br /><br />[...]",1

"Normally, this are outstanding bars.  If you dont believe it, go to a local health food store and try one (Trader Joes sells them as well).  I subscribed via Amazon a few years ago, and for whatever reason the last 3 boxes have arrived damaged.  They have a awelfull tainted taste unlike ones that are found in local stores.  They had a yellowish color (normally off white), and looked like they had been melted several times over even though the expiration date was current.  The last box, Amazon said they would fix the issue but havent.  I cannot return them because of Amazons policy.  Also interesting, I wrote a review similar to this one regarding the same issue, but Amazon deleted it off the website.  In any event, I cancelled my subcription and will contact the makers of this good product to let them know that somewhwere in the shipment process it is being mishandeling.  I would venture to say that many of the one star reviews are from people who dont know what these bars should really taste like,",1

"I have bought several flavors of these fruit leathers at local grocery stores. I did not know that these came in different sizes. These were much smaller then the size in my local store so they were not as good of a deal as expected. Of course I should have looked closer at the size, the packing looked the same, so it is harder to tell then on something like a box of cereal. I love apricots. I was excited to try this flavor. It was not as fruity when I first ate it and the after tatse was kind of soapy. I have enjoyed the strawberry amd rasberry flavors so Im not sure it is just a bad batch. I wouldnt order this flavor again. Even my kids who usually eat these like candy didnt like them.",2

"I will have to respectfully disagree with some of the other reviewers here.  As someone who cannot have gluten or casein, I often have difficulty finding good cereals.  Unfortunately, Arrowhead Mills' Organic Maple Buckwheat Flakes continued that trend for me.<br /><br />Some of my complaints about this cereal are common to many -- it gets soggy quickly, it's very expensive for its size, its nutritional value could be better.  What really bothers me, however, is the almost metallic aftertaste it leaves.  Although the ingredients say that it is made with natural maple flavoring, my refined New England maple tastes do not find this flavor to be anything familiar.  It is very strong and very unpleasant.  I found that I have had to brush my teeth immediately after eating each bowl just to get the aftertaste out of my mouth.<br /><br />I usually like Arrowhead Mills products, but this one misses the mark for me.  I'll finish the box, but I won't be buying it again.",2
"... per handful.<br /><br />It tastes good, but to market it as a low-calorie alternative to other snacks is kind of a stretch.  I mean, geez, there are only 70 calories in a fun-sized Snickers, but nobody would call it a healthy treat.  A little tiny bit of anything is low-cal (well, except for maybe alfredo sauce), but I wouldn't seriously consider this as a part of a healthy low-cal diet.",3
"This tea is really tasty...I wasn't even a tea person until tasting this, and once I did, I was hooked. The flavor is light and super-refreshing but you can still taste and smell the mint. The only reason why I took off one star is because I tend to like things that taste strongly, and this one is a little bit delicate for me. To remedy that, I either steep it with hibiscus or black tea, or I steep it at double strength and all is well.<br />Putting it with honey and stevia also tastes great, and makes me feel better when I have colds. I love this tea!",4

"I really wanted to like this product. I really, really did. Having to cut back on fats and sugars, this seemed an ideal product for me. However, I just can't cope with the flavor. Mixing the powder with sugar free jelly produced a water mess that seeped out the sides of my sandwich. Plus, the flavor was completely overwhelmed by the little bit of jelly I threw in, despite using two heaping tablespoons of powder. Using it on its own, mixed with water, produced a consistency that was more what I'm use to encountering with peanut butter, but again the taste was lacking. It tasted like an echo of a slightly burned roasted peanut. I'm sure the product is a great one for what it is, but I just can't see using it as a substitute for non-powdered peanut butter.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because the texture,when mixed with water, has a nice consistency, and it was very finely ground which made it easy to mix. I also think that it would be great for baking...maybe for rolling truffles in to give it a powdery hint-of-peanut coating.",3
"I'm not an avid coffee drinker, so when I bought my Keurig I really had my eye on the other drink types (teas, cocoas, hot cider.)

I hope one of the other hot chocolate k cups are better than this.",1

After I bought a espresso machine, three weeks ago, I thought about making my own white chocolate mocha at home; so I decided to buy this product.<br />This morning I read the instructions on the bottle and put two table-spoons of that chocolate in my cup of coffee... Then, three, four and, finally, some sugar to add some flavor. I put over 250 calories in my coffee for nothing. I never got white chocolate flavor at all.<br />I am, to say the least, disappointed and, definitely, I will never buy (or recommend) this product again.",1

They actually taste sort of sweet at first, with many degrees of flavor. The spiciness is more of a lingering taste that bites afterwards. I'd say these are definitely a good, unique chip. But if you absolutely hate sweet chips, I'd try a different flavor since these are a little sweet.",4

"I only gave this tea a three-star rating because there is not a really nice strong flavor to the tea.  It tasted a bit vague to us.  Therefore, I recommend not using as much water to make a ""pot"" of tea or using two of the blooms in a large pot to obtain a better overall tea flavor.",3

"This is ok coffee, I love their donut shop coffee, but this jet fuel is very unique and I am not a fan (were they going for a fuel-y taste?).  I like Green Mountain Dark Magic much better for just very strong, not as bitter taste.  I don't plan on purchasing again.",3
"I read many of the negative reviews here, but decided to give it a try since the price is right.  I don't have any complaints about the packaging, but I also found the taste mediocre.  Despite trying more tea and/or additional steeping time I can't get a cup brewed that is both strong, but not bitter.<br /><br />With that said, it isn't bad tea and it superior to supermarket teabags.  But when I use this up I'm trying something else.",3
"My daughter is not very picky, and would usually eat anything. I got her to eat about half a pouch the first time I introduced them to her, but it was a losing battle after that.

"To say I am no expert on tea is ...well... the truth. My earlier experience with tea was the occassional cup at a Chinese restaurant,or the cup loaded with honey for a sore throat. For me it was coffee, coffee, and more coffee.<br /><br />However,hearing so much about the benefits of green tea,I picked out a box of it at the store and put it up on my shelf.It just sat there. Then disaster struck - I was out of coffee! I remembered the green tea on the shelf and thought what the heck, maybe it will hold me over till I get to the store. I liked it! It gave me an afternoon pick-me-up that I wasn't expecting and even thought it tasted pretty good as well. I don't remember what kind it was as I have been through several boxes of green, various brand and flavors of the tea since then. Then I hit on:<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM68QG"">Good Earth Tea Green Tea, Lemongrass, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> -see my review for details of the Lemongrass - I loved it. It was the best I tried. Naturally I found the best deal here at Amazon.<br /><br />Next I wanted to try other flavors. This Orange flavored sounded pretty good. It has the added benefits of super anitoxidant(70% more than Good Earth's standard green tea) Japanese teas matcha and sencha. I found both the aroma and taste much lighter than the Lemongrass. The Orange gives just a hint of it's flavor. Other reviewers felt otherwise, so I would suggest to try one box first and if you like it go for this multi-pack. I do agree though that it's great for what ails ya. It's definitly one I would drink for anything from colds and sore-throats to aches and pains of all sorts. I also read that the matcha leaf helps to cleanse the body of toxins.<br /><br />This blend brews up an appealing golden shade. It gives me a renewed and refreshed feel but I also found it to be more calming than the Lemongrass which gave me quite an energy boost.It also doesn't seem to be dehydrating -as coffee can be - with more health benefits.Although I personally prefered the taste of the Lemongrass - my only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 - I still like this one and it is nice to have a litle variety for different moods or needs. And I don't need to add anything.<br /><br />It is caffeinated, but comparably much less then coffee per serving. It may be served hot or as Iced Tea.<br /><br />From the box:<br />Ingredients: Sencha Green Tea,Orange Oil,Green Tea Extract,Natural Flavors,Matcha and Chamomile Flowers.<br /><br />Super Green Tea - 162 mg avg antioxidants per serving.<br />Good Earth Standard Green tea -108 mg avg antioxidants per serving<br /><br />So I still love that morning cup of Java, but now I look forward to my afternoon Green Tea as well.Now I would find it a disaster to be without that! I even took some with me on a recent road trip - just to be sure I had some wherever I went.<br /><br />Remember to breathe,eat healthy and...enjoy the holidays!....Laurie",4
I love dark chocolate but sometimes the bitterness is a bit much. Newman's Own had a nice balance and flavor. I love the Newman's Own brand and their commitment to raising money for charity and using Organic ingredients. I'll happily be buying this product again. Highly recommended!,4
"St Louis didn't carry pink grapefruit so I ordered some. It tastes just like squirt ruby red. Can't decide which I enjoy more, this or black raspberry.",5
"I purchased this item for my 3 year old, after reading the reviews online.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  I purchased both the strawberries and bananas by this company and BOTH were SOFT, not crunchy...from the very first time I opened the package!  The strawberries came in a two pack, so I immediately opened the other pack thinking the first one was just a bad batch...no, those too were very soft and chewy.  I purchase these (expensive) items because I expected them to be crunchy like the small one serving packs I purchase at Walmart.  Not even close.  Kicker of this all...you cannot return food items for a refund (this was our first time purchasing food through Amazon so I did not realized this until I went to send them back).  Not a good buy...",2
"Excellent assortment of high-quality nuts, lightly salted for just enough extra flavor.  Temptation is to eat too many!  Actual container did not have the South Beach name on it, but they were pretty much the same as the nuts in the container that previously had the South Beach name.",4
"This Boston Cream Pie flavored coffee from Donut Shop Classics wasn't anything special. In fact, the name Boston Cream Pie might just be a fancy way of saying ""here is your standard fare of coffee with rich cream"". It was smooth, rich, and delicious, just as I expect Donut Shop Classics coffee to taste.",4
"First of all, this flavor smells great.  But who drinks anything just for smell alone?  The first few sips are not bad.. it does remind me of an Appletini, however, if you keep drinking - well, let's just say it might turn your stomach a little.  The artificial sweetener aftertaste in this flavor is a lot stronger than what is found in the other flavors of Crystal Light.  I just don't think I could honestly sit and drink a whole glass of this particular flavor.  Great try - and I wanted so badly to rate it a 3 out of 5, but because I would not drink a whole glass at a time, I couldn't see myself doing so.  Sorry - go back to the drawing board on this one.",2
I love spicy food and when I ordered these I was extremely disappointed at how non-spicy they were. Plus the noodles were too chunky for my taste. I am used to mamas thin noodles. These were just too chunky and pasty and not spicy.,1
"Roger That!<br /><br />After two years in my bin, I uncovered black moist compost and...wait for it....UN-decomposed green bags.  What the heck?  ""Compostable"" bags that do not Compost.  Have returned to putting everything in my compost can and just dumping into the bin and then rinsing-out the can.",1
"I hate when people throw around the words Miracle Product about anything.  It sounds so douchey.  So... I've decided that would be the title of my review.  I think in general, coconuts are one of the most insanely useful nuts/fruits/things(?) found in nature.  Coconut water is extremely delicious (Amy & Brian's brand or C2O, the other brands can be meh), coconut milk is a great substitute for milk in certain non-dairy applications for all you hipster vegans, and Tom Hanks made a best buddy out of a whole coconut.<br /><br />Coconut oil, when it comes in the pressed extra virgin form, like with Nutiva or the other kinds you can purchase thru GNC, Vitamin World, etc. is also a miracle product.  It has a lot of applications.  It stays solid at room temperature which is pretty gnarly.  That's not a pro nor a con, just wanted to get that out there.  Knocking over an open container of this oil doesn't mean you have a mess to clean up, it just means your a klutz.  It's great for hair care, so say my black friends.  I have pretty thick hair so I don't really need it for that.  It's awesome for skin care too, like for acne scarring or minor skin blemishes.  It's completely anti-fungal and antibacterial so that means it's an all natural lubrication.  That last one was not something I have any personal experience with either, it's just something I wanted to type to make any readers still here uncomfortable.  But it's true according to many ""What to use coconut oil for"" websites.  It's also good to add as a means of healthy fat to a protein shake or vegetable concoction a la Joe Rogan Experience kale shakes in the morning.  Lastly, the real thing I use it for, is baking.  It's a substitute for butter at a ratio of 1:1, and a substitute for shortening at .75:1, meaning 3/4 cup of coconut oil is 1 cup of shortening.  Check this page out:<br />[...]<br /><br />The ChezUs recipe for banana bread is awesome.  Ok, I'm not writing any more stuff about coconut oil, don't be so goddamn lazy, go research (google) it on your own.  I was just supposed to write 20 words on this product but started my rant.  Buy it.  Or don't.  I don't really care what you do.  But if you do buy it, buy the 54 fl oz. jar like I did because it doesn't really spoil, more is better, and because I said so.",5
I can't find many brands of decaffeinated coffee pods. Senseo's brand is satisfactory but it is nothing like the decaffeinated coffee I get in restaurants. Folger's brand of decaffeinated coffee pods is a little better than Senseo's.,3
"My son loved the original recipe Chick Chick but Happy Baby has now changed the recipe.  My son retched upon the first bite of the new meal.  Why do companies try to ""improve"" upon something that already works.  I'm guessing to cut corners somehow (ie. cheaper ingredients).  It's a shame.  I now have a case of the new recipe that won't be eaten.",1
"The coffee I tried had scarcely any flavor or aroma.  I feel that the hazelnut additive was more dominant than the taste of the coffee, and even that was quite weak.  I did not find the flavoring nutty either; rather unnatural tasting.  I generally have my coffee with the addition of half-and-half only; it is quite possible the people who enjoy this are accustomed to using syrups which might compensate for the blandness of this coffee.  Speaking of syrups, if you like hazelnut then I'd recommend instead a hazelnut syrup or liqueur added to a better coffee.  I found no advantage to the whole-bean either; I've certainly had better pre-ground Folger's coffee.  This is the second time I've both tried and been disappointed by the Eight O'Clock brand, and so I am beginning to suspect that I was not merely the victim of an old or otherwise bad batch.",2
These are great!  Our whole family likes them.  They are wonderful as a dessert too!  Whenever I really want crunch and Peanut butter this is what I go for. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because they do have too much fat in them.  If eatting both little bars they have 9 grams.  I tend to split it w/ someone or just eat it for breakfast!  Still it is organic and does have fiber and soooo much better than a candy bar!,4
"Dont get me wrong I like the creamers, but I think half and half would be better. These are nice you dont have to keep them cool. I do find I need 3-4 for a regular size cup of coffee and 4-5 for a large. The valu with subscribe and save is awesome. If you want them to stay cool a i found they will fill the average size crisper drawer in a fridge. lol Hope this all helps.",3
"I was fully intent on becoming a mole serial killer.  I wanted the very mention of my name to strike fear in generation after generation of the little turds.  But, to this point, the moles are having the last laugh.  The trap has failed to catch a single tunnel builder.<br /><br />The ""trap"" has sprung once in the weeks I've had it set. I could barely contain my excitement as I wrenched it from the tunnel, only to find that all it contained was a large clump of bermuda grass.<br /><br />My wife is belittling me for my purchase of this device.  I promised my young neighbor I'd bring her a mole, as she's never seen one.  Looking over the fence and repeatedly telling her, ""Not yet"" is getting embarrassing.<br /><br />It seems the moles are on to me.  Each time I set the trap they alter their route(s).  As soon as I move the trap, they return to their old tunnel(s).  It's becoming a game to both of us.  I WILL WIN THIS GAME.<br /><br />I ain't giving up.  I trusted the glowing reviews of this device that I read.  Yes, I have considered that the review was written by either the inventor of the trap...or by an employee of the trapmaker's company.  But I will persevere.  While my friends await the reportage of the first dead mole; while my neighbor awaits her first ever eyeballing a mole; and while my wife continues her laughing at my empty mole trophycase...I continue the battle.  I will not toss this ""trap"" into the pile of failed mole-stopping gear.<br /><br />I will report back when the first mole meets its demise.",1
"I got this in a large pack of Dove body wash at a big name bulk store and was excited to try it out.  I normally use the pouf to shower with (Don't tell my Pals!), but decided to give this a go.  It's, as another person posted, ""Like using a Brillo Pad!"".  I have very sensitive skin so it's way too rough for me.  It's too small, gets very slick, and it's impossible to reach in between the Guy parts.  I don't see how any Man could ever use this other than for scrubbing dirty, greasy hands.  It's made more for the mechanic or coal miner who needs to scrub their skin to get clean and definitely not for a Guy who occasionally does some yard work, etc.  If you arrive home looking like Mike Rowe after a hard day at ""Dirty Jobs"" then this may just be for you!",1
"I was very impressed with this cereal.  It straddles the line between the healthy and the sweet/sugary.  The result is a phenomenal cereal that both the adults and children in our house were excited to eat.  In fact, my youngest even opted for this over his usual sugar-saturated brand.  Once we were through with the box, he (and I) were actively looking for this item every time we visited the grocery store.  For me, the crowning virtue of this cereal is that it remains crunchy in a bowl of milk.  Whenever I eat cereal, I tend to eat quickly to avoid sogginess.  One morning, I poured my cereal and had to focus on helping the kids with something and only came back to it after several minutes. With most cereals, I would return to a soggy mess that I poured down the drain.  Amazingly, this cereal was still crunchy and delicious.  That--and its exceptional taste--will ensure that I continue to seek out this excellent cereal.",5
"My bad, I fell for it - limited ingredients don't mean diddly unless the ingredients are good. I failed to squint and didn't notice it's more chicken meal than chicken -  apparently our dog is allergic to something in it and it gives him nasty gas, I do mean nasty.",2
"This bar tastes pretty good, but it's not delicious. The nice thing is that there is a lot of chewing involved, and it takes several minutes to eat, which makes it a more satisfying food experience. I eat mine before bed with 8 ounces of water. My blood sugar is now a little better in the morning. I am on insulin at bedtime, so this gives me peace of mind that my sugar will be more or less stable throughout the night. My blood sugar in the morning is about 5% or 10% better than with just eating a small bowl of unsweetened yogurt at bedtime. (If I don't eat anything at bedtime, my sugars are worse in the morning.) The bad thing about this bar is that I always get a funny aftertaste from Splenda. But it's before bedtime and I just brush my teeth and just go to sleep and it's manageable. I enjoyed the crunchy texture of the Chocolate Delight bar. I have ordered these through Amazon Subscribe & Save Program and got a discount, which is a good thing.",4
"I bought these jimmies because I couldn't find the needed orange color in any of my local stores.  A pound of jimmies is a lot, but I went through more than I expected, probably half the bag to thoroughly coat a recipe of chocolate truffles.  The taste is, well, jimmy-taste.  My only disappointment/surprise was how short these jimmies are -- about two-thirds of the length of Wilton and CakeMate brands I have in the cupboard.<br /><br />If you need a special color that only CK makes, don't hesitate to get them.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee  Wesselmann",4

I was a little confused when I picked this item up, because the label on the dye shows a red color, nothing near ""true"" terra cotta, but the swatch (as seen left of the dye) shows terra cotta.  I went ahead and purchased this and wasted my time and money.  My icing came out pink and and grew closer to red as I added more dye.  I ended up using orange and various other colors to get my desired terra cotta coloring.",2

I usually couldn't get past the taste, sometimes it was the texture and sometimes the detrimental effect on my digestive system of a few of them.<br /><br />I had none of those problems here.  I loved the taste and crunch and was pleased with how it didn't seem to send my glycemic levels shooting through the roof.  I just felt healthier eating this as a snack plain/or with milk/or sprinkled on yogurt.. will repurchase in the future albeit the price makes me somewhat hesitant.  I do highly recommend, however...",5

"Based on the copy, which boasts awards, I was excited to try this tea. I should have known I was in trouble when I couldn't get the plastic off the cap. I'm sure that's a safety measure, but it's not exactly ""save the earth,"" now is it. The pungent smell was the next clue. It's supposed to taste like passion fruit but it tastes like chemicals---and it probably is. The ingredient list states passion fruit ""flavor."" I only had a few sips, and I cannot get the taste out of  my mouth. The final straw is the globs, and I do mean globs, of aloe vera gel that are floating around, waiting to assault your mouth.<br /><br />With 19 grams of sugar, you'd be better off having a cup of water and a cup of fruit yogurt instead.

"These Nonni's Biscotti ""Toffee Almond"" are good tasting, but very sweet and have 110 calories each.

"I am a fan of the Bellini drink, white peach puree and Prosecco (a Italian sparkling wine) and I was NOT disappointed.  I mainly brew it for ice tea.  I disagree with some of reviewers in that not only do you taste the raspberries and peaches you can also taste the sparking wine.  This is my primary drink in the summer.  To give it a little kick I will sometimes add a peach liquor or peach flavored rum.  I recommend it highly",5
"I kept wasting the almond milk in the larger container because I do not use that much of it in the time that it needs to be used up to keep it fresh, so I thought I would try this size. It is perfect for me. I mostly use it on granola or in a protein drink.I also live far away from stores and so it is very convenient for me to have amazon ship it on a regular schedule. I love subscribe and save and wish more of my organic foods were on it.",4

"I'm not sure why it makes sense to put vitamins in a squeezable package. It reminds me of the 4 or 5 blade razors that are prevalent today- do we really need such technology? Probably not, but if it helps you get your vitamins, I suppose it's not a bad thing. Aside from the package design, the drink is fine and the concept of adding this to your other drinks is great. I never even thought to do this with my powder vitamin packages. The squeeze makes accurate portioning difficult, but all in all, this is a worthwhile buy.",4
"My family loves this soda.  We sometimes buy it from a nearby grocery store.  HOWEVER,  I had it shipped from Amazon and it is no good.  I believe that somewhere in the process of getting to my home the Zevia Orange may be getting too hot.  It was very hot weather the first time it was shipped to me.  It really tastes weird...not like when we buy if off the shelf.  I tried again in cold weather this time and though it's not as bad, it is still no good. It has an odd bite to it that I assume comes from it getting too warm.  It alters the beverage and cooling it in the frig does not reverse it.",3

"My son is not a picky eater, but he really doesn't like this flavor.  I love the HappyBaby brand in general and so does my son, who is 11 months old.  I'm not saying this is a bad product, but I definitely would not buy it in bulk before you let your child try it.  You are much safer doing that with the fruit/veggie mixes.  Try before you buy seems like common sense.  However, the only store that carries this brand locally for me (Target) has a very limited selection so I couldn't let my son try this flavor before I bought it.  I imagine that is the same for other people shopping on-line.  I thought I could mix it with something else if he didn't care for it, but he will have nothing to do with it, mixed or otherwise.  I have to say that I agree with another review that says it looks & smells like cat food.  I try all of the food I feed my son and thought this product was bland, bordering on bad tasting.  I give it 3 stars, because I think this product is definitely not for everyone, and more of an acquired taste.  I highly recommend HappyBaby though!",3

"Just bought a bunch of this last month. This was our introduction to coconut cream (milk) powder to be used as an alternative to milk. Very Yummy. We will be making the switch. However, the low star rating comes from the fact that Chao Thai Brand powder (Manufactured by Korn Thai Co, LTD) has added sugar in the form of glucose syrup! According to the nutrition facts this addition adds 5 g of sugar for every 30 g serving size. I know that glucose is different than regular sugar, but for us, any added sweetener is unnecessary. Because of this discovery we are looking for a no sugar brand.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients as stated on the box:<br /><br />Fresh coconut cream - 85.20%<br />Glucose Syrup - 11.8%<br />Sodium Caseinate (Milk Protein) 2.0%<br />Silicon Dioxide - .5%<br />Dipotassium Phosphate - .5%<br /><br />That being said, if you are looking to try coconut cream powder and you do not mind the sugar this is a great product to try! We did not find any problems with grittiness, or clumping - just a smooth drink with a hint of coconut taste(not overpowering or overly tropical which concerned us). We just added the powder to hot water like we were making a cup of hot tea and then drank when cool enough. We used 1/3 cup of powder in 2 cups of water for a light drink and 1/3 cup of powder in 1 cup of water for adding to curries and other foods.",3
The instructions called for adding 6oz hot water. I added 8oz but still thought the taste was quite strong. You could probably dilute it with 12oz and be fine. Even so it has a strong ginger taste -  much more so than say ginger ale. The lemon gives it a bit of acidity as well. It almost too much. The taste is not bad but there's a lot of it. Wasn't my favorite.,3
I have to say the pizza flavor is not my favorite. They have a strong oregano flavor that is off-putting for me. I love how good for you they are though and I know I already like the chocolate flavor so I'll stick with those or try another flavor.,4
"rather pricey.  Amazon is selling these for $34.98 a carton (you get 6 boxes, each with five little packs in them) That works out to about $5.83 a box.<br /><br />Ok, that said...they are tasty, and the convenient size makes it easy to control how much you eat.  Each little packet has 130 calories.  Not a bad snack if you are watching your weight, as I am.  There is a lot of sugar for such a small little snack size (18 grams), so that is a bit of a drawback for me.  I do like that there is no trans fat in this snack though.<br /><br />When I was young my father used to eat Snack Well cookies, I don't remember what they were called, but boy were they yummy!  As I got older I dont' remember seeing snack wells for awhile, or perhaps I over looked the items on the shelf.  But, it looks like the brand is reinventing itself, with bright new packaging. (The cheery green with yellow is certainly eye catching!)<br /><br />Bottom line-this is a tasty snack.  Something I might buy for myself once in awhile, but at this price point it won't become a mainstay in my pantry any time soon.",4
This soup is okay and it is fairly healthy but I expected a little zing. A drop of tabasco perked up the flavor. It's  a little mushy but easy and filling.<br /><br />I would not purchase again.,3
"I purchased these based on a recommendation from the Hungry Girl emails as a great low fat snack.  These are ok, but the flavor is definitely not what I was expecting, there is almost a burnt quality to the flavor.  Also, the serving size doesn't seem like that much since the cookies are very thin.  For similar nutritionals you can have about the same amount of Keebler Elfin Crackers, which are much more tasty and satisfying.  If you liked the McDonaldland Cookies as a kid, go for the Elfin Crackers, they are very similar in flavor.",3
"I started using 5 Hour Energy about 10 years ago while a long haul truck driver. Then, I would buy them from ebay in the 100's in order to get the best price.<br /><br />But since 5 hour has been doing its media blitz over the last few years it has increased in price to the point that Im just not willing to pay. Guess they have to pay for that advertizing somehow...<br /><br />I just happened to see this product on the shelf of a Walmart & I decided at the price, it was worth a shot. ( pun intended...)<br /><br />Red Rain works for me just as well as 5 Hour. The size,taste & packaging is similar but it comes in a 12-pack for less than a 5 hour 6-pack. As long as Red Rain keeps up the quality & keeps down the price Ill keep using it.",4
"I can't believe I've used this stick as long as I have. This gel stick, and gel deodorants in particular I've found, is sticky and takes a while to dry - especially for a guy like me with a decent amount of hair under my arms. It doesn't stain shirts, but I am particular about letting my deodorant dry before I put a shirt on so with it's stickiness and gel-type, I'm left shirtless for quite a while. Though it does smell nice initially, the pleasant smell turns to that smell you get after you've worn gel deodorant all day. It's not bad, but it's a distinct smell I seem to get with all gel deodorant I've tried, but not with the dry form. I'd recommend Mitchum deodorant instead of this type. The dry deodorant sticks aren't sticky and dry a lot faster. The Mitchum deodorants are also very good anti-perspirants. I don't sweat at all when using them and they last over 24 hours.",2

I'm having a difficult time finding treats for a diabetic dog that are sugar free, low in fat, and something he will actually eat. I found it in this treat. BUT it's made in China. With all of the recalled pet products being made in China products, I can't bring myself to buy any more of these. Back to feeding Greenies? they're made in USA",3
"I love this full flavored tea any time, but you really need to like hibiscus to enjoy it. It can taste a bit sharp sometimes if you over-steep it.",4
"Just smelling this bottle makes my toes curl in strawberry-induced euphoric pleasure. &lt;3<br />This is really sugary though, and the strawberry flavor isn't as strong as it's smell. That makes me a sad person.<br /><br />I think Teisseire would sell better if they expanded to a fruit-perfume business. Yes...",4
"(I posted a similar review for Timothy's French Vanilla K-cups) Has a mediocre taste but its very weak even when brewed on the small cup setting. Generally, i find Starbucks coffees to be too strong and Duncan Donuts to be too weak. My preference is somewhere in between. Unfortunately, these Timothy's k-cups just taste like water.",2
"Always trying to give holistic, natural healthy treats to our dogs, but this product has the words ""Made in China"" in tiny letters. Our dog became ill. Vet suspected poisoning, tested for and found that the liver was failing. At autopsy, poisoning was verified. 4 other dogs were also sickened by this product. Be very careful. Trust treats made in China and you are taking a huge risk that no one wants to take with their beloved pet.",1
"great food choice for those that are looking for alternate protein source. Our dog is allergic to chicken and beef. This is the first food that didn't smell intolerably fishy (even the lesser quality wellness ocean smelled nasty). Believe me, it's still fishy, but tolerable.  After a few weeks on Wellness Core Ocean, her coat is super shiny and soft.  Would purchase again!",4
This product is available at Costco (Business Costco) and is a fraction of the price..its about $36 if you buy 6 packs of 18 (1.75 0z) . But nonetheless a good product. Tastes great.,3
"Convenience is probably the best feature of this machine but a machine that heats, grinds, steams, packs and pumps is bound to compromise somewhere and this machine is no exception.  The Vienna Plus will not pump coffee at the finer grind settings.  On the other hand, coffee at the factory setting is not bad.<br />I drink my coffee black which means that the taste is not obscured by milk, froth, or spices.  But coffee straight from the Vienna Plus is muddy, foamy, and poorly filtered. Since I like the speed with which a cup can be produced on this machine I pour it through a chemex paper filter and lo! poor coffee<br />is transformed into something quite good! It's not quite as good as chemex coffee made manually but it's in the ball park and it is much more quickly produced.<br />Other reviewers have complained about the plastic housing of the Vienna Plus but I suppose a solid metal housing would cost far more.  A more serious complaint is the plastic interior. The water may be heated in stainless steel but it is poured through a plastic brew group and hot water processed through plastic is likely to release small amounts of toxins into the coffee.",3
"The kit is great. This is the 3rd kit I have made, it is easy to follow the instructions.  I am new to making wines and this is a really good kit to learn by.  The product is quite tasty and is just as good as a  tropical fruit wine that I purchased at the store to get an idea of what I would be making.  I like this better than the store bought one.",4
These marshmallows were great! They taste just like the ones out of a box of Lucky Charms. I add these every morning to my bowl of Lucky Charms!,5
"Best popcorn ever...found it originally at Big Lots, couldn't find it anywhere after that. Ordered it from Amazon.  It is soooo addicting - not too limey or salty - just good. If you keep it in the freezer it stays good forever.  Just pop it into the microwave from the freezer. Fresh popcorn every time.",5
"I picked up a can of this soup because it sounded interesting, but I was very disappointed. The base was really bland, I was thinking it would be sweet because of the corn, but it wasn't. The chicken was okay but the carrots were mushy and the celery was cut too big and was bitter. I didn't even finish it and definitely won't be buying it again.",1
"I took a gamble, thinking this sounded like a fun idea, even though I had seen some less-than-glowing reviews.<br /><br />I really didn't care about the jumbled mess these come in, or the pretty beat-up condition of some of the K-cups. They are all in date, to my pleasure included a couple of recently discontinued varieties, and being a little scuffed up won't hurt them.<br /><br />What did NOT please me was that at least HALF of the K-cups in this sampler were NOT Extra Bold varieties. Worse, 3 of the included K-cups were decaf (1 Extra Bold and 2 not).<br /><br />Seemed kind of festive getting that big box, but the contents are a bit of a letdown. From now on, I'll stick with ordering the specific K-cup varieties that I want rather than try one of these samplers again.",3
"The poptarts were very tasty, the kids loved that they had several boxes.  However, I think it would have been alittle better if we could chose something other than the brown sugar ones.  Like maybe 2 flavored ones. Or a non-iced and iced flavored poptarts.",4
Benecol chew brought my cholesterol level down to a normal range after 3 months of use.  No problems with liver function as with the statins and cheaper than red yeast rice.  I recommend it and have recommended it to friends.,5
I absolutely LOVE the BBQ popchips.  They are my favorite but when I saw they had Chili Lime I thought that would be even better. Not so much. I purchased an entire box of 12 of the 3oz bags and wish I would have just stuck to my BBQ.,3
"i normally don't write reviews, but needed some recourse since i have to eat 6 bags of this bitter stuff. and the bitterness refuses to go away no matter how long you wash the grains. (other quinoa i've eaten in the past, i don't even bother to wash.) the nutty quinoa flavor i love is entirely missing. don't buy it.",1
Disappointed with these chocolates.  Disliked the taste.  I would not order again.  I live close to Napa and wished I had ordered Woodhouse chocolates from St. Helena.,3
"These are the toughest artichoke hearts I've ever eaten. They're so tough, they squeak when you chew them. I'm giving several cans away.",2
"I was disappointed when I received this bonsai desert rose for a number of reasons.<br /><br />First, the packaging.  I have mail ordered other bonsai so was disappointed at how much dirt came out during the unwrapping process.  I would highly recommend you unwrap outdoors, perhaps on grass where you don't care about the dirt.<br /><br />Second, the bonsai I received is not the one shown, or even really much like it.  I was hoping for the gnarled, twisted root and trunk look in the picture.  What I received was basically a fat trunk, no gnarls, no twists.  There are feeder roots coming off the trunk almost 3 inches above the dirt level.  The base does not seem firmly rooted in the pot at all.  In fact, if you grasp the trunk, you can easily lift the entire rootball out of place, without disturbing much of the surrounding soil or decorative pebbles.  Almost like it was just shoved into the pot for shipping to me.  It was advertised as suitable for a beginner, but I am going to have to do some quick research and see about repotting it more securely into the pot.  Far from what I was hoping for.<br /><br />Third, the plant ccame with a sheet of general instructions, not specific to this type of plant.  The first paragraph tells you how vitally important a humidity tray is for the plant's well being.  Why not add $7 to the price and include the darn thing rather than making me call in a separate order and pay for more shipping.<br /><br />Fourth, who the heck is Sheryl?  I made this purchase based on another review which mentioned how nice Sheryl was to deal with on a problem.  This shipment came from Lou's Bonsai--no Sheryl in sight.  Not that it really matters, but it seems odd.<br /><br />I have been bitten by the bonsai bug hard and intend to purchase more, but I most likely will not buy another bonsai from this seller.  There are other sellers available on Amazon and over the internet that will ship you exactly what you see in the picture, rooted into their pots appropriately, etc.  I gave the review two stars because the plant itself seems basically healthy.",2
"Before I used this product in a recipe, I read a lot of reviews here since there is not a lot on the bag. And from the negative reviews and complaints about hard noodles, what directions that are on the bag do not seem very helpful. So I went to the positive reviews and looked for guidance there.<br />My conclusion? Ignore the soaking instruction of one minute in room temp. water. Try hot or boiling water, for a couple of minutes, stirring to separate them. Then all was well.<br />I used them in a shrimp and vegetable soup and added them at the very end, cooking a little more until I felt they were done for my taste.<br /><br />That being said, I still had a couple of issues with these. The noodle are very, very, very thin. Thinner than I would like.<br />Also, the packaging, in a bag, does not provide adequate protection and a great deal of the noodle were broken to tiny, tiny pieces. Ok, for a soup I guess, but in say, a stir fry, no.<br />I looked at other brands in the store today and they all used a much stronger package to protect the very delicate noodles.<br />So not at all sure I would buy these again.",3
This coffee brews very weak - like a light roast.  W.P. Chef's reserve pods are just over half full.  Put pod on scale and it's 15% less coffee wgt than normal pods.  Stick with normal pods or extra bold if you like coffee that taste like coffee.,2
"If you like a bold coffee that's strong but not bitter, this is the coffee for you.  It has a great full-bodied flavor that's very enjoyable to taste.",5
"I bought 2 of this item for our (2) 14wk old labs and was shocked at how big they were!! They didn't seem to be too worried about the size once they realized treats were inside of it and it is a toy that they can grow into! If you have a smaller breed of dog, I would recommend getting the smaller size. I tried using larger treats at first (size of large breed chunk dog food), but they had a hard time figuring out how to get them out. I decided to use some of their puppy kibble instead since it is relatively small and they had a much easier time managing it. Now they have mastered it so well that I am going to have to resort to the larger treat sizes! It keeps them busy for about 30-45 minutes at a time! Overall, very pleased.",4
"Weak, dry, tasteless coffee.  Doesn't taste even remotely like it was made with Columbian Arabica beans.  The grind was also of very poor quality.<br /><br />How bad was it?  This stuff makes Folger's seem like premium, high grade stuff.  I have no earthly idea how people give this Community Colombian Classico such a high rating.  Perhaps I just got a bad batch of very old stuff from Amazon but I'll not be giving this coffee a second chance!  Probably one of the weakest and most tasteless coffee beans I've ever bought.",1
This tea has a smoky undertone to the flavor. All three cans had the same smoky flavor.  Other than that the tea was fine.,2
"I fed this product to my cat and my roommate's cat.  I was experimenting with food since the cats are almost 1, and I wanted to introduce different kinds of adult food so they'd get used to them.  I mixed half Science Diet dry kitten food with this product, and the cats began to eat less.  I was worried about how much they were eating (nearly 1/4 their original diet) so I filled one bowl with this indoor cat food and one bowl with their kitten food.  They barely touched the indoor cat food, while eating most of their kitten food.  I ended up having to mix some canned cat food in with it to get them to eat.<br /><br />Part of it might be that the food is triangular and much larger than the kitten food.  They had a hard time eating it at first, since they were used to the small pieces of the kitten food.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged, though.  My cat can't tell the difference between the kitten food and the regular adult food.  They really enjoy Science Diet's fish flavored food, so give that a try.",3
"They would eat some of it, but not finish it which they do if they really like the food. It is very easy to open and feed as you just squeeze the pouch.",3
"I ordered what I thought was pictured and described but instead received the Gluten Free version. Not thrilled. Also the bags are so beat up they are about to fall apart.  Who's filling these orders...Return, return return.....",3
"We have had the breville single serve coffee maker for several years now and have tried many different varieties of k cups.  My husband and I like our coffee strong enough for cream and sugar but dont like bitterness.  Jet Fuel is strong enough to use the larger cup size and still have great flavor.  It has no bitterness for such a strong cup of coffee.  I recently purchased and sent several boxes as gifts for family and friends who recently purchased kcup systems--my brother in law had been using the make your own k-cup with his ""fancy"" coffee beans but said the day he received these he ended up having 2 cups by 7:30 in the morning because it was so good--he had to stop himself from making more that day! I also love parisien nights by timothy's which has a slightly smoky/dark chocolate flavor and midnight magic which is slightly sweeter.  Jet Fuel is definitely one that we keep around all the time",5
"I have actually tried all three new Taco Bell Sauces, the Jalape&ntilde;o which I am reviewing now, and also the Spicy Ranchero and the Chipotle sauces.<br /><br />Of the three, the Jalapeno is my least favorite because it has the flavor that seems to miss the mark.  It's got a little spice in a creamy base but it just doesn't seem to mesh together well.  Maybe because it's refridgerated and if it's going to be creamy and spicy I'd prefer to have it warm.  It just does not seem to work well and I can't figure out what food this sauce would taste best with.  The label says to use it on Taco Salads and tacos and things like that.  And you could use it on fries.... but I am not sure that it would taste all that great considering there are so many other options.  I would urge you to try one of the other two new Taco Bell sauce flavors first, the Spicy Ranchero or the Chipotle.  Both of those were much better in my opinion.<br /><br />The bottles are squeeze bottles but I found that they don't squeeze out easily once you are half way done with the bottle. You have to store upside down in the fridge or be forced to really shake the bottle to get the sauce to be forced down the the top. Sauces are thicker than traditional salad dressings.",2
"Shipping was fast! The bones are good quality. Some are smaller than others but, they are thick inside. My pitbull loves them! Saved 2/3's by not paying $16-$20 each at pets stores.  Will be buying them here from now on.",4
"Crunchy.  Came packaged well.  If you are thinking they are going to be like FunYuns, you would be wrong.  They are VERY mild flavored.  They are ok, but nothing I would crave for sure.",3
The picture and description is NOT accurate for this product as the shipped package replaces Cranberry Apple and Tangerine Orange with Wild Berry and True Blueberry!,1
"Dogs like them fine but the biscuits are just loose in the box.Bottom box seam not taped completely so dog biscuit ""dust"" falls out and is possible path for vermin. I would prefer if there was a liner or inner bag. If you buy these plan on storing them in a different container",3
"I have eaten in some of the best Indian Restaurants and this sauce really is excellent. It is not a sauce that a chef prepares from scratch in a fine Indian Restaurant. However, for a quick home dish it really is good. I have had it by itself and with some tweaking. My wife and I would recommend this sauce to anyone. Very tasty.",4
"My cider arrived very quickly, but was shipped very poorly.  3 of the 6 cans were damaged at the bottom of each can due to the way they were packaged together.",3
"I was disappointed and suprised that the 100 count tea bags were sent loose in an unmarked box. Also, the tea, when brewed, does not seem to be as strong as when I have purchased the same blend from traditional grocery stores. I question the freshness and authenticity of the product. I will not buy this product again in this manner.",2
"Good texture, good taste on the Ahi tuna. Almost as good as beef jerky.<br /><br />Avoid the salmon jerky. Most of the strips were hard and brittle. Some were so tough they were barely edible...more fit for my dog. Also the salmon was too spicy.",4
"We used to get greenies from Petco, what an amazing price difference this is!  Our beagle eats one every day and it keeps her breath in check.",5
I bought these potato chips because they sounded tasty and because of the natural sounding ingredients... but also specifically because they are gluten free.  I have a son with food allergies and he cannot gluten... or Milk.  I was so upset when I received these to find out that they contain Milk!  I do not see this information anywhere on the product page.,3
"This is a nice new flavored coffee, the cinnamon is a mild flavor..Great after dinner coffee, for something warm, slightly sweet with a mild touch of cinnamon and a touch of cappuccino foam on top..Love it !! will keep it in my pantry. I love most of the maxwell house international coffees...",5
"The crackers are OK.  I am looking (note present tense) for a graham cracker that is organic, and these taste fair but the big ding comes from them not being %100 organic; the description did say %74, to be fair.  For $1.50, I can get the  14 ounce store brand box of graham crackers that use graham flour, and save some money if I'm not getting a truly organic product. YES, most of the ingredients are organic.... but one turd in a pool sends everyone running for the deck.  BUT, they are GMO-free- and that does help somewhat.<br /><br />The flavor.  Hmmm.  Well, they're OK.  I'll use up what I got. Maybe.  There is a mild cinnamon flavor that isn't awful, but not what I wanted. I like cinnamon, but I wanted more of a honey graham flavor. The texture isn't really 'crisp' either.  They're not soggy, but it wouldn't take much to make them soggy if they were used in something like a pudding dessert.  I won't reorder them.  For a natural product, there's a funny flavor and aftertaste.  Glad I got the Xylitol gum in this order to kill the aftertaste.",3
THis stuff is awsome. but DO NOT PAY THIS $15.00 price. You can get it at the Le Gourmet Chef store for 7.99. THESE people should be ashamed of them selfs for jacking up the price so high.,5
"This is a waste. If there were nothing better, I'd just never eat a bread product again.",1
"My husband and I were so disappointed when they discontinued Starbucks coffee discs., after reading the reviews on amazon and trying several different coffees, finally found this one, it's the best coffee so far and my husband is very pleased ! I didn't think its possible to find anything to replace the Starbucks coffee but this is it. We love it!",5
"We really enjoy Stash teas and saw the sampler as an excellent way to try new flavors, most of which are not available in any of our local stores.  We enjoyed most of the flavors - and have found a new favorite, blueberry.  The aroma and flavor is just like fresh blueberries!  The flavor intensity varies greatly between flavors, which can be a good way to find a flavor to suit your mood.  The ginger, however, was just too strong and burned my taste buds.  I also enjoy Bigelow teas and would agree with another reviewer that some of the Stash flavors (little under half) are mild in comparison.  However, there are times when a gentle chamomile is just what I need.  I probably won't purchase another variety pack, but will purchase our new favorite flavors separately.  I recommend this to anybody looking to experiment with new flavors; Stash has some wonderfully original tastes.",4
"Hot from the toaster, add a scoop of ice cream - I like chocolate - drizzle with some hot fudge sauce and a dollop of whipped cream - ooooo! It's too good. Not just a toaster pastry anymore.",4
"I tested this water against my regular tap water and Whole Foods spring water - it does have a smooth and almost silky quality and a pleasant taste. We blind tested all three and could reliably identify each of them (just checking it wasn't my imagination!). I only received one sample bottle so I can't comment on its claim to 'hydrate better' or any of the supposed health effects, though some other reviewers have noted long-term benefits.<br /><br />I like the oversized bottle - if you're trying to drink more water each day, it's ideal for taking to work to measure how much you're actually drinking. It's a good product though the biggest downside is the cost compared with other bottled waters or home-installed filtration systems.",3
"I only drink loose leaf teas, and I was pleased with the quantity of this product. Problem is that I really don't love the taste, and I am drinking it every morning because there is so much of it! It is a strong tea that needs to be infused briefly (in my opinion). If you prefer a slightly bitter flavor, you will like this tea. My tastes gravitate to black teas with light flavoring such as mango, peach, etc. or green teas. Again, my palate doesn't welcome oolongs or rooibos either, so I may be too much of a light-weight to make an accurate evaluation of this tea. It's strong and it's plentiful. I haven't tossed it, but I sure am bored with it.",3
"I wouldn't call these almonds sweet, but they do have just the right hint of sweet flavor that the almond is elevated and feels like a treat.  The taste and texture of almonds doesn't particularly appeal to me, but they're such a healthy snack that I'm glad to find this delicious option.  Also, the small container is the perfect size to have on your desk or keep in the car, or use as stocking stuffers like I plan to do for a couple of my healthy eating conscious friends!",4
I had many a k-cup but at 1.29 a piece. I'll just take my refill cup to the store and let someone else make me a cup. I have bought k cups on sale for as little as .54 a piece. Green mountain is one of the better coffees but lets be realistic with the price huh.,3
"Bought this thinking it cheap and more convenient, but i was wrong. The meat in the package seem dried and old. The price was also higher comparing to my  local samsclub.<br /><br />I like it when the meat is more tender and moist. And this doesn't deliver that. 1 star.",1
"Cotton Candy Match!  To say I'm excited is an understatement!  I loved Cotton Candy as a kid and still at the age of thirty-seven will buy cotton candy when I see it.  My hubby humors my childlike excitement.<br />My first encounter with this matcha was heaven!  I opened up the pouch, preparing it for the tin that will keep in the yummy goodness.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.<br />I unpacked my matcha bowl that I specifically as for at Christmas time so that I could properly prepare matcha.  Then came the chasen from its tight plastic case.  Since this was its first use I warmed it up a bit under water, sitting in the bowl.  I think part of what I love about matcha is the preparation that feels very ceremonial.  All items ready...bowl, chasen, matcha and water!<br />First I mixed 2 oz of water with 1 perfect teaspoon of matcha. Of course in my preparation I was so excited and almost forgot to sift it first..disaster avoided!  Once that was properly mixed I added a teeny bit of sugar (this is cotton candy of course) and 6 oz of water.  After I properly exhausted any strength from my whipping right hand I was ready.<br />The smell of this matcha is not as strong once mixed with water.  The taste is there though!  The quality of this matcha is very tasty.  It doesn't taste too vegetal or clash with the sweetness off the cotton candy.  I think next time I will add just a bit more sugar as I didn't want to go overboard the first time and not really get  the original taste of the matcha.<br />My plan for the rest of Cotton Candy is to mix it first as a latte.  Then, try adding to my health food drink which is a vanilla base.  So I'll be back to let you know how that works out!<br />To get your own tasty Cotton Candy Matcha from Red Leaf Tea - GO HERE NOW!!!!<br />[...]<br />In closing - YUM!!!!",5
"But you might like it. I spent 1968 in India and do not remember having anything called Butter Chicken (but all my British friends are familiar with it and like it). But the flavor profile was immediately familiar. If you don't want a curry or spicey dish, then this may be for you. I prefer the Tandoori and also the Tiki Masala. Probably just a matter of taste. These are all excellent products.",3
I ordered a flat of food (they were on sale) that contained The Turkey and Wild Rice Dinner.  One of them was also improperly sealed; the lid popped.  We were lucky because I just happened to check that one.  Now I'm so paranoid that I check all of them several times.  I called Earth's Best and they assured me that they haven't had this problem before and that I shouldn't worry about it.  I'm so suprised that this got passed QA/QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer.  Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?!<br /><br />These are 2nd foods but please note that they're much more watery than Gerber or Beech-Nut 2nd foods.  I think the watered texture frustrates my son and I spill it everywhere when I feed him.  He likes the flavors fine except for the Chicken Mango Risotto (hates it).,1
"Baby loves this flavor, however, my baby (and I would assume most) would have issues with this one... My 15 month old has been sleeping through the night perfect for months now, until I started feeding her this(1 pouch a day) every other day or so. I'd give her the super banana flavor on other days. All of a sudden she started waking up during the night, multiple times, crying and just a plain wreck. After a couple nights like this my wife mentioned how the baby seemed to have a lot of gas lately. A few days more of this I was going crazy. I started looking at all the things we changed recently and came back to the happymorning foods I just recently bought. Started looking at the ingredients and nothing appeared out of the normal for the super banana flavor. Started looking this one over (super cinnamon) and the 2nd ingredient is PRUNES! My baby doesn't handle prunes well and she has been going through a very tough time lately because of this food. I stopped feeding her this flavor and all went back to normal. So again, just a warning for all.",3
"I drink a lot of coconut water and thought this was a great deal....big mistake. It is beyond sweet...doesn't taste like it is straight from the coconut at all like other brands. Next time, I'm sticking with ordering ONE.",2
they did not like these! I cut them in half thinking that they could smell that it was sweet potato but that did not help.,3
"These treats are awesome. My dog is 12 pounds and these are perfect for him. He loves soft treats and the stinkier the better so this is right up his alley. I have a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ARUKTG"">Ourpets DT-10504 Smarter Toys IQ Treat Ball , 5 Inches , Colors may vary</a>and these treats are the perfect size for it. They roll out easily but not TOO easily so it keeps him busy for at least an hour. I got the chicken flavor and my dog thinks they're great. I love them because they are healthier for him than the other treats we'd been giving him and they are great to train with. I'm glad it comes in the 16 ounce bag because we go through them pretty quick!",5

"I read the reviews and so tried a case of this mix....not happy with it at all.<br />  My dog likes it, that's all I can say.<br />  I made the bread in my Emeril breadmaker, which has turned out loaf after loaf of incredibly perfect bread....until now.<br /><br />It is DENSE, and when you slice it, unless you slice it thick, it falls apart.<br />  I had my husband try it, just telling him it was a new mix...he thought it was ok, he toasted it, with lots of butter, so the flavor is apparntly ok.<br />  I will have to try it for bagels or pie crust. Maybe it will work better for that.<br />Other than being at high altitude (and I followed the high altitude directions) I can't think<br />of anything else that could have gone wrong. I used the ingrediants it asked for....",1
"I was very disappointed with this purchase! The k-cups came in a plain box with the cups dumped in.  Most looked smashed or old. There is no expiration date so there is no way to tell how old these things are. They look old!!  Also, beware of return policy for this is NO return available (and there is NO mention of that on the item!). $40+ down the drain and in the trash. I will NEVER buy coffee through Amazon again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
The See's Candy I ordered for my husband was stale and old.  The chocolate was white it was so old. Horrible experience!,1

"I was feeding my 3 cats with the expensive Innova brand, thinking to avoid the pet food scare from not long ago. They liked it and for awhile everything was fine. Then one of my cats started having a reaction; she kept scratching her face and eventually made a bloody bald patch. I took her to the vet and he was immediately able to identify it as food allergy (red spots in the ear canal was another indicator). I searched on Amazon for allergy sensitive food and this popped up. I didn't want to have to feed my 3 cats separately, so I was planning to make them all convert to the new food. Thankfully they all love this food and with Amazon's awesome pricing, it's actually cheaper than the Innova food I was previously buying. I highly recommend this brand and ingredients for allergy sensitive cats.<br /><br />Now if only Amazon offered it as a Subscribe & Save, everything would be perfect *hint hint*.",5
"I go back and forth between Monster and Rock Star. I have a Mega Monster or a couple Rockstars at least 3-4 times as week.  This No Fear was alright. I thought that flavor was just a bit off and not really pleasant.  Between Rockstar and Monster I think Rockstar Punched is far superior if that helps judge the flavor.<br /><br />I didn't get jittery or wired with this, but then again I only had one.<br /><br />One thing it didn't do was upset my stomach like some energy drinks - so that is a plus.<br /><br />All and all I didn't think it was any better than what I already drink. The flavor would not make me want to switch at all.",3

Popcorn has good flavor. when my package arrived 2 of the packages had leaked out the liquid butter flavoring all over the other packages.,4

"This milk powder is too fine. With your average supermaket dry milk, you can just sprinkle the powder into your oatmeal and it will dissolve. This stuff, on the other hand, turns into chewy clumps unless you reconstitute it separately with a whisk. As a result, there are still three bags of this milk powder sitting in my cupboard, unused.<br /><br />This milk tastes fine. It's just too much of a pain to use.",2
I LOVE THIS COFFEE.  WONDERFUL FLAVOR AND IT TAKES ONLY A LITLLE TO MAKE A LOT.  THIS IS MY FAVORITE!,5
"While my 11 month golden retriever LOVES the fire plug and the everlasting treats, these replacements weren't a good fit for the toy. He had them out of the fire plug in a matter of minutes. The everlasting treat that came with the toy fit much tighter and lasted a few hours.",2
"Considering the price of honey these days, this would be a pretty decent buy if the product were shipped and received fully intact. I received this bottle, which is supposed to have a flip-top lid, with only the lower part of the lid on it. The top, flip part had not only been raggedly broken off it, the missing part was not even in the box! Obviously, the person who packed it could see that the top was broken off, but decided to send it to me that way, regardless. The inner seal was intact, so I decided to keep it, as it would not be worth the cost to send it back. It is delicious honey, with excellent citrus notes. However, noting that another customer also had a packing problem, this seems to be habitual. I would have rated it 5 stars if not for this problem.",3
"I love the Chai latte @ Starbucks.  Since I couldn't find that at a reasonable price in Amazon, I chose to try Mocafe Divinity Spice Chai mix.  To my surprise, it came out really very well.  The Starbucks chai and this one are totally different things.  Both taste good in their own fashion.  Starbucks chai seems watery but this one is the thickest you will ever get.  Mocafe is highly creamy all the way down but Starbucks is not.  This is a powdery product, Starbucks is liquid product.<br />Again, I seem to love Mocafe even though I am a big fan of Starbucks Chai.  I highly recommend this to all the Chai lovers out there.<br />Note: This had a price advantage over starbucks chai when I initially bought.  But I later found that Costco is selling Starbucks chai at a very cheaper price.",5
"My cats enjoy the taste of this, it seems to be healthy for them also. My orange tabby has hairball problems, hopefully the moisture will help him out here. The bag is heavy duty, re-sealable, and easy to store. I would definitely get this again, maybe in another flavor just for variety.",5
"Smooth rich coffee, comparable to a local favorite.  However better when I used the proportions, I prefer with my coffee maker.<br />Often I find, when I follow the coffee manufacturer's recommendation for coffee, I find it too strong.  This was no exception.<br />I prefer 5 coffee scoops (essentially 15 teaspoons) to 64 ounces of water.  The manufacturer recommended 2 teaspoons for each 6 ounces of water, which would have been about 21-22 teaspoons. Slightly different, but harsher tasting.<br /><br />All in all a good cup of coffee.",3
"Although the was packaged and sent in a timely manner, I was sent the wrong Item.  I ordered the Hersheys Milk chocolate and was sent the Hersheys with Almonds.",3
"This was a great toy for my beagle, who immediately figured it out and nosed the cube all around the house while the kibble dribbled out.  Not so for my pit mix, who didn't have the patience for such antics. Instead she just tried to bite it in half.  It didn't take took long for her to be able to do just that.  Although I will say the buster cube has lasted longer than some similar interactive toys which took her seconds to destroy, it's now unusable like the rest.",3
"This is an intense, rich, flavorful coffee. While I like a robust flavor, this one seems quite acidic. It does ""chase fog"", for sure! I think it has a real caffeine kick to it. The cups are intersting in that they have a wider brim so they fit right into the Keurig without touching the bottom poker. I brewed a 12oz. cup and a 16oz. cup. The 16 was more to my liking, but the acidity of the coffee made it difficult to finish either cup. Just a little too strong for my liking. Interesting packaging. We drink several cups a day, so I don't believe it would get stale. And they do fit right in the carousel.",3
"A friend of mine brought these over to my place a month ago for one of my horror movie marathons (""horrorthons"").  I think they're just ""OK"".  Nothing great.  They have a cheese flavor added to them.

"1st off I would like to say that I have bought trolli from this seller before, about 2 months ago and I got the 5 pound bag of trolli gummi worms that was exactly what I expected. This most recent purchase I have to say I am very disappointed. They sent me the knock off brand of trolli and the taste and texture are totally different from the original. No soar taste at all. I'm going to find a new seller. :-(",1
"This price doesn't make sense. These bottles are three dollars each, when you can get them for around 2.50 in stores.",1
I rememberd the Sunshine rasin cookies of my my youth. These looked like them so I purchased the tin.  Not very good. Dry as the desert.  Perhaps they were just stale.,1
"I was looking for an easy snack that was an alternative to ramen and such. However, this was a very big disappointment. The flavor was awful, not only bland, but it had some sort of off putting stench. Some sort of plastic trying to be meat smell. Second is the portion. There is a reason that this thing only has a small number of calories, it's because there are only like 4 bites of food in here. I'm much happier with a head of raw cauliflower. Now I don't know what to do with the rest of the box.",1
"The flavor of this product is good.  The calories are low.  But the reason for that is because these are thin cakes, about 1/2 the thickness or less of a rice cake.  This means I pretty much have to eat 2 to feel like I ate something, which doubles the calories.  The flavor is good.  I just didn't know they'd be so thin.",3
"These cranberries are the best tasting dried fruit I have EVER had! Fresh, tart yet sweet, excellent. A big BRAVO!!!<br />I wish I could give them 10 stars!

"I saw the chocolate chip cookies on the image, and I wanted gluten-free dairy-free chocolate chip cookies.<br /><br />The problem, is that these ""mini chips"" are miniature chocolate chips.

"We bought a case of these based on the positive reviews, but quite frankly no one who has tried it has liked it at all. It's a bit bitter, and the raspberry is tart tasting. Smells OK when it brews, but so far of all the people who have tried it (wife, myself, friends, relatives), no one has really liked it. So we have a half case of it sitting around collecting dust.",2
"This pasta is fine if you do not care about a glucose spike 3 and 4 hrs after eating. It contains inulin which is in the clear version of Metamucil. Only slows down absorption for an hour or two for me. Caution if eating left overs the rise is quicker. If you eat this with tomato sauce realize all tomato sauce has carbs you need to take this into account. People have said it is the acid in the tomato sauce that causes the rise, some sauces contain a lot of carbs and added sugar. These same people must have forgotten the stomach produces one of the strongest acids in nature to aid digestion so my guess is look at the carb count in the sauce for that rise. I can not believe by adding inulin which is found naturally in onions and bananas could prevent starch breakdown completely. It does seem to protect the starch to glucose breakdown but only for a couple of hours than by the third to fourth hour comes the spike. It is only tested for glucose rise for one and two hours after. Do a 1, 2, 3, and 4 hr blood meter test for your self. Many who really need to be careful with insulin spikes should check the 3rd and 4th hour to make sure it is safe. If you are on a low carb diet and you fall out of ketosis a couple hrs after eating anything get a blood glucose meter this way you can see a cause and affect from anything carb questionable you may eat. If it works for you that is great but be cautious. I am not a diabetic but follow a low carb lifestyle I get no rise at all the first hour than slow rise by the second. Than it comes for me between the 3-4 hour as if I ate a normal portion of regular past. I have never tested past the 4th hour.",1
"Everyone wants to know if it works, right?  Well for me it foes and there is one BIG BUT, you must drink a lot of it. Here's my experience.<br /><br />I've been using it for 5 months now, first 3 months I took it 1-2 times a day and wasn't sure if it was helping. I was also taking Fenugreek supplements but when that gave my baby gas I stopped and just stuck with the tea. I don't like any type of flavored tea and at first I was sure I'd dislike it but I actually love the flavor and it wasn't causing any harm so I kept drinking it.  Then winter came and I was cold and wanted some tea with dinner at nights. I'd take 2 tea bags put it in a big tea pot and have it at nights on top of having some in the day all of a sudden in just a few days I was in pain with oversupply. I couldn't believe it but suspected the tea. So I stopped taking it a for 2 days and noticed my supply went to back to its normal level which was always enough for my daughter.  Started taking about 4-5 tea bags again and BAM supply was  back up. I was feeding my dragsters constantly and in just 1 hour I'd be engorged again, couldn't believe what an effect the tea had.<br /><br />Still using and loving it today after 5 months of breastfeeding.  Would recommend to friends and family.",5

"Items weren't even shipped until after the projected span of delivery. I was willing to overlook that if these were amazing, but they were dry and seemed burnt. I taste nothing but the smokeyness of the chipotle pepper, like they seasoned it before roasting and burned all the seasoning.

"I discovered this product while living in the Philippines with my wife. I was so glad to be able to find it back home in the United States in local Asian grocery stores (first in California, then on the East Coast and online).<br />I love the TASTY HEAT that this product puts into my curry dishes. It is versatile, as I have used it to make beef, chicken, and pork curry (haven't tried to make seafood yet, but soon). This is so much cheaper (per ounce) and tastier than the impotent crap that they put in small fancy glass jars that they overprice and try to pass off as a great product. These companies (can you say Thai Kitchen) that manufacture those imitations probably survive here because most people don't know that they can buy MAE PLOY which is 100 times better. Not only is Mae Ploy tastier, it is also so much cheaper to make sauce with. All you have to do is add coconut milk (less than $1 for 14 a oz can) and/or a little fish sauce(not for me) to match (actually overmatch) the mix that the imitators sell. I also love the fact that I can vary the potency of my sauce because it is not pre-mixed with coconut milk. I once purchased a unauthentic crappy product out of desperation when I first returned to the U.S. in 2007. I used the whole jar (11 1/2 oz) and payed about $5. It was so weak and flavorless. That will never happen again as I keep it well stocked. One jar of this lasts me about 4-5 large curry meals (I always make enough for leftovers as I use two or three cans of coconut cream). So if you make a smaller amount it could last you 8-10 meals. They even make a 35 oz size of Mae Ploy that you can find (google it). Just make sure that you seal up the plastic well before using again (I also refrigerate it after opening).<br />Bottom line though is that this is the BEST and the ONE and ONLY Curry Paste that I will ever use. I never order curry when I eat out because I know it will not be as good as the one that I make at home. Thanks to MAE PLOY RED !! Thanks for reading. Read up on this product and then try it out, you won't be dissapointed.",5
"Those have to be the three most boring cups of coffee I've ever had. The first cup tasted like watered down creamer and sugar. Thinking maybe I'd done something wrong, I tried again with the same result. Next time around I used two pods, no cream, and no sugar hoping for a stronger cup. No dice. I really like the idea of the coffee, the organic certification, fair trade certification, charities and initiatives they support, but come on, make me a stronger and more flavorful cup! Brown water isn't going to cut it.",1
"Ordered 3 boxes of hard-to-find One:One Melitta coffee pods, 18 pods in each box.  Expected what was shown in picture and product description.  I received the wrong size pods, different name and different package (container). Not what was ordered. Told them, but no response.  Not too happy about this. First disappointment of an order placed through Amazon.",1
Ouch. These things are like eating stones. The flavor is good but they are closer to a hardball in texture than to any licorice I've had here or in Europe. I think these were left on the loading dock too long.,1
The reason I like the european version of Ovaltine is because the first ingredient IS NOT sugar. A tasty treat to which you can add more sugar if you like.,5
"If you love food that leaves your mouth burning long after a Mexican meal, and if you adore the taste of ginger, you'll love this beverage. Over-poweringly- piquant and heavily overwhelmed with the taste of ginger, this hot drink would really warm you up on that cold winter night. I am mad about ginger, and I crave spicy foods that burn my mouth for hours, so I enjoyed this beverage, once. All this said, I didn't love it, and I won't buy it. The ginger is overpowering, even for me, almost completely masking the light lemon and honey taste.<br /><br />If you are craving a rich, sweet drink to warm you up, this is not it. If you don't enjoy mouth-burning delicacies, this is not for you! However, ginger is very therapeutic for certain health conditions, so this may be a more appropriate use for this product.",2

"I purchased this thinking ""what a great deal!"" Now I know why it was, and it really is a bad deal! First off, several containers were defective. The top parts were not secured (they flipped up), so the screw off top wouldn't work properly. Second, really didn't like the taste. Thought I would as I love the Peach/Mango, but this is awful, doesn't taste @ all like tropical fruit! Perhaps, this was just a fluke (defective bottles, bad taste), & I realize all tastes are different, so some may like it. The defects were just insult to injury...  Turned out to be a big waste!",1
"I found these bars to be okay. If I was in a pinch and really needed something to eat, these bars would serve their purpose. I could barely taste the peanut butter and the bars had a mealy texture that I didn't enjoy. Maybe it's the fact that I'm not a die-hard chocolate lover, but I would have enjoyed a drizzle of chocolate on top of the bar rather than the hard layer at the bottom.",3
"Normally my husband uses whatever shampoo that is within reach while in the shower.<br />He tried this 2 in 1 Anti Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, it lathered up nicely.<br />Years back when I purchased 2 in 1 anti dandruff shampoo and conditioner, it did not lather and reminded me of like school glue (if that makes sense)<br />This was not like that at all.<br />Removed all of his hair product residue from his hair and left his hair soft, shiny and very clean looking and healthy looking.<br />Like this product and the results.<br />The scent is not over powering in my opinion and I think a woman could use this as well and not have to worry about the scent being too much.",4
It arrived quickly & in good condition. It has good flavor. Nice product.,2
"I make tandoori chicken all of the time so when I saw the price on this premixed seasoning I couldn't resist. When my case of 12 tins arrived I read the label only to discover that the expiration date was one month away.

I've been giving tins to all of my friends and telling them to use it right away.",3
My dog doesn't always like new food.  I think she really liked this Chef Michael's food. I checked out the ingredients and it along w/ meat for protien and veggies it says it contains 23 essential vitamins and minerals.  It also contains cruncy kibble. I can't taste it so of course I was relying on my dog's willingness to eat it when put in her bowl. I must admit the thing that I loved the best was that it didn't stink like most dog food/kibble.  Dry dog food really stinks to me no matter what brand I've tried but this didn't have that stinky smell. I give this a thumbs up and will be trying it out. Haven't checked the price to compare to others but as long as it's not double the price I will be purchasing another bag.,4
"This made the best kahlua pork for my son's luau party - tasted great. I will say, this is a lot of salt - be prepared to store it for a while. I have also used it in a salt grinder for smaller grain salt. Tastes different than Kosher or other salts. Nice product.",5
I'm normally a fan of jack links but this really disappointed me. Ordered 4 bags and had two of them. I spent more time picking through the meat taking out the nasty gizard and fat chunks all throughout the bag. Also the meat quality was terrible and quality control isn't. Good for this flavor. One piece would be moist and flavorful and the next would bard as a rock and uncomfortable to chew. Overall this was a terrible product. Jack links shouldn't put 10 different cuts of meat in the same bag. If you like quality controlled products this isn't for you.,2
"Let me start out by saying how sad I am to give this product a negative review.  I love watermelon EVERYTHING, so I was super excited when I saw this new syrup was available.  I have to say, however, that it blows my mind how the guys in Amoretti R&D actually thought this syrup tasted like anything but watermelon cough syrup.  For use in Italian sodas, this is *completely* undrinkable.  I've confirmed this with a few friends to make sure I wasn't just being a bitch.  Others reviewers here have mentioned using this syrup in yogurt, and I did try a couple pumps in a strawberry smoothie, and the dairy did seem to help cover up the poison/medicinal overtones.<br />  In short, I cannot recommend this flavor.  If you're looking for a good watermelon syrup, try the Torani version.  I'm sure Amoretti has some excellent flavors in their arsenal, but this is definitely NOT one of them.",2
"I've always liked Cheez-Its, but the original cheddar version was always a bit sharp for me. This new Mozzarella brand has a smoother and ultimately more enjoyable flavor. Overall, I love it. I could eat a whole box of these in one sitting. I only wish they were healthier!",5
"howdy y'all,<br /><br />this is ok. it would be better if the product name ""Real Bacon Bits, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)"" had mentioned the hickory smoke flavoring added to it. i would not have bought this if i had known of that in advance. other than the somewhat sweet, fake-tasting hickory flavor this is pro'ly good stuff.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee",3

"at first I tasted it was looking for somekind of explanation why it didn't knock my socks off like it usually does .. the black tea taste is a bit stronger and the herbal taste is a bit weaker...

"This product was very easy to prepare.  One warning to those unfamiliar with GF 'dough'...it's more like a very thick muffin batter.<br /><br />While wheat flour has that stretchiness, this does not, simply because it's gluten-free.  I think if I had been more prepared for the consistency, it wouldn't have seemed so odd.<br /><br />That said, it was easy to mix (I did it by hand) and it did rise a bit during the waiting period.<br /><br />I added dried oregano and chopped fresh garlic to mine, and will add more seasonings next time I make it.<br /><br />Spreading the ""batter"" is not hard, if you are prepared.  I used a cookie sheet and made one rectangular pizza from one package.  Make sure you oil/spray the pan and you will need to spread the mixture using wet hands.  Again, since this is not wheat, you will be doing more spreading and patting down than stretching.<br /><br />You bake the crust first and then add toppings. I used jarred spag sauce, sliced mushrooms, sliced onions and shredded mozz cheese.  Baked it for about 18 minutes and it was perfect.<br /><br />This will not fool anyone into thinking this is a traditional wheat pizza dough.  There is no comparison, as wheat has totally different characteristics than these ingredients.  BUT, this product is great.  Really, it does not have much of any taste at all, and you can add whatever herbs and spices you want to the mixture to customize it.  The texture was slightly crunchy and even my husband loved it.<br /><br />Since this is my first GF mix, I have no other point of reference, so I can't give it 5 stars.  BUT, I will continue to use this product on a regular basis and I'm looking forward to trying the all-purpose flour I ordered at the same time.",4
"I had the chance to try this out (I'm a guy), and my impressions are on par with what others have said. This product for me anyways leaves my hair feeling greasy and I don't like perfume smells and this one has a very strong scent. I've given this to my wife to try as well if she is interested, if not this will be trashed.<br /><br />It would have been great if there were some real directions on the package but the only steps were ""massage into hair."" Maybe I did it wrong, I don't know, but I don't like this at all and will not be using it for myself.",2
Great price for the 100 count box. Each wrapped individually and the same size as usual. But I found that they were very greasy! No really what I want in a beef jerky. But they did taste good.,3
Bought the bottles less than a month ago.  Totally Tasteless...odorless...useless.  First time I used it and found it a waste of time in my coconut cream pie.  For crying out loud...it doesn't even SMELL like coconut.  Sorry I purchased it.,1
"Like others have said, I really wanted to like these.  While I didn't expect anything approximating true noodles, I was not prepared for these.  This is only a noodle (or fettucine in this case) insofar as the shape is the same.  But that's where the similarity ends.  This is a translucent slimy tapeworm-resembling product that does not remotely resemble food.  I tried it with spaghetti sauce and cheese and the only thing that made it edible was mixing it with true pasta.  But of course that defeats the purpose of the zero calorie angle. While I was thinking perhaps this could act as a filler or stretcher for pasta to lessen the calories, I have to say it is not worth it.  I rather just eat the one or two forkfuls of real pasta than mix it with this.<br /><br />P.S.- You may want to put on a DVD of Fear Factor to give you courage to eat this-<br />or just that old Charlie Chaplin movie where he eats his shoe.",1
I was surprised to find out how weak this coffee is.  It has a good flavor but even on half cup it is very weak.,2
"I bought this dispenser to replace a Bags om Board bone dispenser which worked great until it fell off my leash and I lost it. The problem with the bone dispenser was the plastic ring that attached it to the leash popped open and the bone dispenser fell off the leash without me knowing it  --and this was after only having it for 2 weeks! I decided to order the white dispenser but wasn't too impressed with the plastic zip tie that attached it to the leash either-- as another reviewer pointed out, the end of the plastic tie irritated my hand, the tie itself couldn't be readjusted once you attached it, and I was afraid the plastic tie would eventually break off and I'd lose this dispenser too. So I removed the plastic tie and substituted a metal key ring to attach  the dispenser to my leash and so far so good! The bags are great, the metal key ring securely attaches the dispenser to my leash yet I can easily detach the key ring from my leash if I want to, and I have no problem getting the dispenser open. It's too bad the company doesn't use metal key rings instead of the cheap plastic rings and plastic zip ties-- if they did, I'd give this product a 5 instead of a 4.",4

"I had bought Nestle Dark Chocolate in a single box at local store and loved it.  Then on Amazon, I saw the 50-count, 2-pack size and the outside of the box in the picture also said ""Dark Chocolate"" so I ordered it.  Much to my surprised, it was awful, and the ingredients were different too.  It showed up as ""Dark Hot"" when I ordered it but I went by the picture online and thought it was just a different name for differentiating it from the regular single boxes of Dark Chocolate.  Nope.  Tasted awful and I ended up embarrassingly giving one box to the needy Food Bin and gave the other opened box to some people at work.  Not the same thing at all even though it says ""Dark Chocolate"" (still does), it is NOT the same as the single box of Dark Chocolate with 8 envelopes sold in pack of 12.  I will not buy the actual one I like at Amazon as the price is about the same as my local store.  But if you like the Dark Chocolate generally sold as 8 packets in a box, be aware it is NOT the same thing as the 50-count box labelled Dark Chocolate on the outside.",1
"I do realize I missed the part where it said instant coffee, well I saw it but I thought it meant instant in the kuerig, not actually Folgers type instant coffee. However the so-called k-cups aren't kcups at all. They caused my Kuerig to malfunction and clog. And as if that weren't bad enough the actual coffe tasted burnt.<br /><br />Don't be like me, read and heed the reviews!!!! It's not worth a nickel let alone $20.",1
"I wanted to love. I think Amy's makes lots of good products. This is an ok soup and good for use in some things, stroganoff and perhaps other hearty gravy type things but it doesn't suit what I wanted it for - a healthy substitute for the red and white canned cream of mushroom soup. If you want to use it to sub for that, I don't think you'll be happy with this. If you just want a decent, healthy soup then you might give this a try.",3

"Not just for lunch, snacks, and dinner, but anytime!  I'm having a delicious NB breakfast patty right now.  Shelf life is positively incredible: This box said Best by Sept 2006 but is still just fine! Today I've cooked up the last of the mix I had made up in the fridge for about a week. Sometimes I've kept on hand some NB muffins as grab-n-go snacks or as quick entrees-for-one, since my family won't even try it. (all the more for me!)  Last week I made and savored a Nature's Burger Patty Melt, toasted crispy whole grains bread, toasty/caramelized onion, crispy NB patty, a smattering of mustard to bring out the zing of the (imitation) cheddar cheese. Serve with kosher pickle and baked chips, so good and satisfying. Another way I like NB, I have some super zesty relish and NB takes the inedible heat off the relish so I can enjoy the pepper flavor. Very important: veg oil will keep patty from crumbling and/or sticking to hands and pans.",5

I am a bit torn on these Popchips Tortilla style. I really liked the original Popchips with the different flavors and textures but the tortilla do not seem a good replacement for real tortilla chips and the flavors seem a little too light and washed out.

"My pomeranian is 11 and will eat any treats. Heck, she eats more produce than most people do. So we bought the duck jerky and peanut butter bits. She won't touch either one. Now, she has never been given duck food so I'm not shocked that she wouldn't put it in her mouth, but she eats peanut butter like crazy. So, I looked at the ingredients and both packages contain tumeric, rosemary, and sage. I think that the seasoning may be what turn many dogs off. My dog won't eat seasoned meat. I'm not positive that this is the problem, or everyone's problem, but I don't see any other ingredients that would turn off dogs. Our pet supply store gave us a full refund and we chose another treat that she goes crazy over.",1
"I like the regular Arriba! fire-roasted salsa (which, for a jarred salsa, works nicely), so I tried this to sample other Arriba! products.<br /><br />Oh, man. What were they thinking? The queso is very hot, yes, lots of chiles, but also kinda watery and not the cheesy loveliness that queso should be. The bean dip is bland and has a nasty texture, not the creamy yumsiness bean dip should be.<br /><br />Only try the salsas from this company. The other products are a huge, huge disappointment. Even to a Mexican food junkie like me, these were unacceptable. I threw the queso and bean dip jars away after sampling. Waste of moolah.<br /><br />Big thumbs down for two of the three.<br /><br />Mir",2
"The Switch Black Cherry soda is a fine drink if you enjoy light-flavored carbonated beverages.  To my taste, this drink needs more intensity of cherry flavor to compete with the carbonation.  It contains concentrated cherry juice, along with the main juices of apple and grape.  I found the carbonation slightly more than I expected, after trying one of the other flavors of this brand.  The black cherry-flavored brand name colas deliver more ""cherry punch"", but if your goal is to drink something less sugary and more healthful(100% juice), than this is the one to choose.  The cans are small: 8.3oz., which is good for a small thirst or small child.",3

I called Stash to find out if the soy was GMO, and...the woman in customer service guarenteed me the suppliers sell them non-GMO soy. If this is the case, they really should label it as such. I like the flavor though, it's very soothing and gentle on the tummy (hence the three stars). The only way I will order again is if they start labeling the soy as non-GMO, i can't trust the product without a label!<br /><br />PS: after reading ingredient list again, I found NO mention of soy...",3

The Red 40 is a bit disconcerting, and the package can be frustratingly difficult to open (maybe that's good to curb cravings). Couldn't pass the price up as a gift for a licorice fanatic, but promptly cancelled the S&S subscription because halfway thru the 4lbs, we've had more than enough. They're addicting, but they just don't feel like food in your hands.",3

"I love Tim Tam's, and I searched when I found Pepperidge Farms was coming out with them. That version I can cheerfully pass by. I don't share my Australian ones, even the kids know not to ask. The difference? The original has a very light crumbly cookie, the center melts when exposed to hot liquid into a sublime smooth rich cream and the outside chocolate has so little wax it will melt in your hand. Even several months old Arnott's Tim Tams are better. The US version by Pepperidge Farms has a stiff chocolate coating, a thicker cookie-less porous, and the center leaves a greasy mouth feel. Very disappointing.<br /><br />If you have not tried Arnott's Tim Tams, these are a pleasant creme-filled cookie covered in chocolate and probably good for chocoholics.",1

I am three weeks in to using the stuff on a daily basis, and, unfortunately, the taste is still horrible.  It tastes like chalk and the consistency does not allow it to completely dissolve, so you sometimes will get powder balls popping in your mouth when downing a shake.  I've tried blending mixed fruits, adding cinnamon, adding honey, adding brown sugar... no luck.  The problem is you have to add so much sweetener to counter the bad taste, that you defeat the purpose of making a healthy shake.  My search for a non artificially flavored protein continues...",1

The biggest thing though, is they did not send me what the picture showed.  The majority of them were from the Holiday collection - spiced eggnog, gingerbread and french toast, and I don't think those are even in the picture!  It's like they put in there whatever is on sale at the stores - I just bought the Holiday variety box at Bed, Bath & Beyond for half off, so I was very disappointed that the majority of the 35 were from that collection.  I won't buy them like this anymore.",1

"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1
"I do not use it for my personal cooking because it is really bland.... the taste is only slight more flavorful than water.  But, I do stock up on it when it is available at a local discount store and use it for the dogs' food which I make from scratch.

It has virtually no nutrition... protein is only 1 gram in a cup.",2
"Please make sure you buy this food in small quantities at first if you are unsure that your cat will like it. Our Russian Blue treats it like medicine because he hates the taste of it. He only eats it because we have been strict with his diet and refuse to give him much else besides the urinary formulated foods. We intend to stop buying this product completely.<br /><br />Our most effective food for him has been the Royal Canin Urinary Formula (you can only get it from the vet), as he loves it and it keeps his pH in check - however, it's $50 for a 7 lb bag. Not too pretty.<br /><br />We also tried the more expensive ""Pro Plan"" equivalent - and it is the same product in a different bag, which made it even worse. Both products do work (this one and the Pro Plan) but good luck trying to feed it!<br /><br />We now feed wet Friskies ""Special Diet : Urinary pH"" and our cats love it! It comes in beef, chicken, or (the best one) ocean whitefish. It's very affordable as well. Check it out.<br /><br />If you still decide to try this out, please please please buy a small bag first so you know your cat will not hate it!",3

"This is the kind of garbage ""food"" that gives paleo/primal a bad name.<br /><br />Whenever you see the words ""Gluten-Free"" on a product label, you should immediately be skeptical.  99% of the time you'll want to run away SCREAMING at the top of your lungs.  'Cause it's not only about gluten, it's about blood sugar spikes.  If you care about your pancreas (which you can't live without), and not becoming (or staying) diabetic, you should care about this.<br /><br />Look at the ingredient list:<br /><br />Ingredients<br />Manioc (Tapioca) Flour, Modified Manioc Starch (100% Manioc), Iodine-free Sea Salt, Basil, Garlic, Onion, Oregano. Manufactured In A Gluten-free Environment. Allergen Information: Contains No Wheat, No Soy, No Corn, No Rice, No Potato, No Yeast, No Nuts, No Peanuts, No Lactose, No Casein.<br /><br />Those first two ingredients are garbage carbs you don't want to eat no matter what.  Tapioca starch will spike your insulin faster than a Snickers bar... faster, even, than two slices of whole wheat bread.  No need to investigate further.<br /><br />But say you're still curious. Let's go to the Chebe website.  Here's where the real tale is told:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The box contains 10 servings, at 18 grams each - HOWEVER, you use THE ENTIRE BOX to make one pizza crust!  That's 180 grams of pure, processed carbs with zero nutritional value in one 14"" pizza crust, which is only a medium size pie.  The other ingredients you add to the crust mix are negligible carb-wise (but you still look at them): 2 eggs=1 gram, 1 cup shredded cheese=0 grams if you grate it yourself from hard, aged cheese (the pre-grated store cheeses are coated with potato starch and do add some carbs), 1/4 whole milk=2.5 grams, oil=0 grams. So 3-ish grams are added to the pie.  And now let's say you top it with tomato sauce, part-skim mozzarella and some veggies (since a pizza isn't just a crust).  Even without calculating precisely how much you're using, it's a good bet that you are adding another 30 or so carb grams.  Thus, your medium pizza pie will have 180+3+30 grams of carbs, or 213 total.  You eat half the pie, that's 106+ grams of carbs.  If you're trying to lose weight, that's more than two DAYS worth of carbs.  If you're trying to keep your blood sugar stable, you just blew that, too.<br /><br />To lose weight eating grain-free, the rule of thumb is no more than about 50 carb grams per day, no more than about 15 net carbs (carbohydrate-fiber=net carb grams) per sitting.<br /><br />And that's how you evaluate a ""Gluten-Free"" label.  Or, you could buy the product, make it, test your fasting sugar with a glucometer right before eating, then again an hour later to see firsthand what it's doing to you.  The average healthy, non-diabetic person will zoom from about 90 to 160 within an hour; then it will take another several hours after that to get back down to around 100.  Do that once a day (or several times per day) for a few years, and your problems will be over - because then you can start injecting insulin into your belly with a syringe before each meal and eat whatever you want!  And once again, the ""food"" industry and Big Pharma win.  To me, that's just sad, and the antithesis of paleo/primal eating.<br /><br />I love pizza.  I eat it all the time.  AND I eat a low-carb/high-fat diet.  In a few months, my triglycerides went from 261 to 87, and I'm no longer pre-diabetic.  That never would've happened if I were preparing meals using commercial mixes like this.  There are dozens of reputable low-carb, grain-free recipe blogs and websites out there with pizza crusts made from cheese, eggs, flax meal, nut flours, cauliflower, or even just sausage (Meatz Pizza) that are just as easy to make as this one from a processed mix, that hew to the spirit of paleo/primal eating and are far healthier to boot.",1
"Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats, Chicken compares favorable with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052OUXHO"">Stella & Chewy's Freeze-Dried Salmon & Chicken Dinner for Cats, 12oz</a> which my older cat really enjoys.<br /><br />As both foods are freeze-dried, they both need reconstitution--I heat some water, place some of the food in a shallow dish and pour the water over the food.  I wait a few minutes, allowing the food to get soft, drain the water and then place in the cat dish.  Its a great ""hot"" food alternative for the cat who is too finicky to eat other types of raw food.<br /><br />Nature's Variety is easier to portion.  Each chunk of food comes as a disk around the size of a fifty-cent piece with about half an inch of thickness.  Once softened, I have cut this a bit with a fork, but for the most part, my cat likes it so much she moves it off her plate to attack it whole.  The Stella and Chewy food comes in smaller tater tot shapes which unfortunately, depending upon the way they are packed to be shipped can arrive crushed.  For some reason, the crushed food does not appeal to my cat.  In addition, it is difficult to decide just how much food to give the cat--once reconstituted, the food will go to waste if the cat, like mine, decides not to eat it all.  Nature's Variety's size makes this easier to manage and will result in less waste.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats, Chicken, makes for a seemingly delicious entree item for my very picky cat who purrs while she eats it.  Easy to portion out and reconstitute, it makes for a raw treat to ""serve"" on top of kibble or just alone.  Recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />""reneofc""",4
"If you are all about eating salt covered chips, you'll be OK. For people who don't like the taste of salt poured in their mouth. Might want to move on.

"I got a SodaStream for my birthday.  It comes with a 12 pack syrup sampler with 6 diet syrups and 6 ""regular"" syrups.  I have only tried the diet, caffeine-free syrups.  None of them come close to tasting anything as good as the diet drinks I buy at the grocery store.  Even the store brands taste better than the SodaStream diet drinks.  They remind me of the pre-Nutrasweet sodas that used saccharine as the sweetener.  I use my Soda Stream to make seltzer and it does a great job at that!  I've been experimenting with using drink mixes like Crystal Light, and those work OK.  DISCLAIMER:  I'm one of the folks who get a bad aftertaste with Splenda and Splenda is the sweetener used in the diet SodaStream drink syrups.",2
"These remind me of Now & Laters in that they've got an interesting tangy-sweet taste with a subtle petrochemical flavor. Like Now & Laters they taste nothing like fruit, but that's not what they're going for. I'm not a big fan of regular Twizzlers but I like these a lot - too bad they're not low calorie. They're a bit dangerous because they seem like they should be filling, but they really aren't so you can eat a lot of them without thinking about it. Best to portion out a few ahead of time & put the bag well out of reach.",4

I have a dog training book (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446675385"">Good Owners, Great Dogs</a>) with a picture of a dog pooping, and the caption says: ""To those of you who do not have housebreaking problems with your pet, this picture may seem a bit crass. But for those of you who have struggled with this particular behavior, a dog doing his business outside is a thing of beauty and a joy forever."" Well, I think of this whenever I unfurl one of these bags.  My rescue dog may have came with all sorts of training issues, but bless her, she is perfectly house trained.<br /><br />The bags are a decent size, wide enough to encompass the target. They are long enough to tie with enough clean part at the top, but would be even nicer if they were a bit longer. They are occasionally hard to open. Each roll is approx. 2.25 inches wide and 1.25 inches thick, including a plastic core which seems unnecessary to me.  I don't have a Bags on Board brand dispenser but they fit into a dispenser purchased at Pet Food Express. The bags are printed so you can see where to tear, which is nice. The ""Ocean Mist"" scent is not what I would call a ""fresh, clean fragrance"" - a bit cloying and sweet - but it does help mask that other fresh fresh fragrance. The bags are a pretty color but the contents do show through a bit.<br /><br />All in all, these bags are a worthy buy. I will no longer risk the horror of grocery store plastic bags that sometimes have holes in them.",4
"The red ones are really good, but the green ones none of my friends like. xD I bought them for a halloween party and I was left with a pile of greens bleeeh- it's may and I still haven't pond them all off on people. If you're giving them out for a party be ready to deal with all the green ones.",3
"This product claims to be Natural.  But there is nothing natural about paying a rabbi to bless a jar of peanut butter. Skippy Natural is a kosher certified product, which means that the consumer is paying slightly extra to cover the rabbinical fees involved in the certification procedure.<br /><br />Not all people want kosher products. Skippy should sell a non-kosher version of this product, for a reduced fee. But they don't.<br /><br />For those who don't know:<br />In order to determine if a product has been certified kosher, just look at the product label.  If you see the letter U with a circle around it, or the letter K with a circle around it (usually it is located somewhere near the product logo), then the product has been certified kosher.<br />You might be surprised to realize how many products in your cupboards have been certified kosher.  When I first learned about this kosher tax/scam, I ran to my cupboards and began looking at labels.  I found that nearly half of the products in my cupboards had been certified kosher.<br /><br />The flavor of this product is good.  But peanut butter always tastes good.  Skippy doesn't deserve credit for the fact that peanut butter tastes good.",2
"I bought a 48 pack of this through Amazon when it was on special.  I normally drink medium blends and stay away from flavored but my wife likes the flavored coffees.  Her favorite is Pumpkin Spice from Green Mountain.<br /><br />What we found is the flavor of this was artificial.  I almost think it tastes a bit like maple syrup.  Too sweet...it would be better with less of the flavor.  I tried making it on the largest cup setting on the B70 but that just waters down the coffee.<br /><br />If you like the flavored liquid coffee creamers, this might be something you will like.",3
"Unfortunately, I found this tea to have a simply awful taste.<br />I did not mind the box haphazardly-crammed full of 100 tea envelopes, but the tea itself has a nasty bitter taste--I have used lots of different kinds of ginger teas, so I believe I know how ginger tea should taste.<br />I was surprised to find that one of the ingredients is citric acid, though I don't understand why they would include that ingredient in an herbal tea.",1
"I gave this product only three stars simply because the coffee was not quite strong enough for my taste.  My usual morning coffee consists of a stronger brew, and this particular product did not give me a strong enough coffee.  The coffee has a couple of redeeming qualities, first it is a fair trade coffee, which I really appreciate.  Secondly, the coffee comes in very convenient single serve packs, which make brewing coffee very simple and fast in the morning.  The single serve packs were also a disadvantage for the coffee because you could not adjust the brew strength of the coffee.  I found that when I made my coffee in the morning, using my normal proceedures that the coffee was not strong enough once I added the cream and sugar to the coffee.<br /><br />The overall taste of the coffee was palatable, if you are a person that likes a light roast, or a light brew.  If that is the type of brew that you are after, this is an excellent coffee for you, personally however I found the coffee a bit too light for my taste.",3
I figured that the makers of the KONG would know the best way to keep my dog chewing productively for more than a couple of minutes - unfortunately I was disappointed. These only last a couple of minutes. I find that freezing actual peanut butter in her KONG is far more effective.,3
"I just re-ordered this decaf coffee.  We have tried several decaf varieties looking for that perfect cup.  The Donut House is our reigning favorite.  We had been drinking Donut SHOP decaf and just tried Green Mountain Breakfast Blend decaf.  While both of these coffees are pleasant, neither compares to the Donut House in aroma or flavor.  This coffee is full bodied in taste and very smooth.  We brew it on the 8oz setting and think that is perfect, although we make the next size larger for my mother who likes her's a bit weaker.  We'll probably keep looking for the perfect decaf; this one is excellent.",4
I bought the Angel eyes chicken flavor for my white faced Persian kitten. She doesn't like the flavor very much at the recommended strength so I reduced it a little.  There is no doubt the product works and her face is clearing up nicely. Her eyes are clear and no longer runny.  If I had to make a suggestion it would be to lessen the artificial flavor so the pets don't recognize that it was added to their food.  I recommend this product.,4
"I had requested green tea and was sent Orange Pekoe Tea instead; an easy error, as the packaging are very similar. Unfortunately I did not notice this until I opened on of the containers. BUT, fortunaltely, I do like Orange Pekoe Tea. I will still have to order a box of green tea. In the future, I will bemore carel to check the label.",3
"Bought these based on the glowing reviews (4 1/2 Stars), and the fact that they were heavily discounted from the regular price. First of all .8 oz. per bag equals about 15 or 16 chips per bag, which is not many. While this may be fine for those who are trying to cut back on calories, fat or sodium, the fact is that .8 of an ounce is not much, and that might tempt people to eat more than one bag at a time.  Due to the discounted price each bag was around $.55 each, not to bad until you figure that equals $10 per pound. At the regular price its about $16 per pound. As far as the taste, all of the flavors were good, none that I absolutely disliked, but none that really rocked my socks either. Bottom line, at the discounted price I paid I was not disappointed, but if I had paid the regular price for these I would have felt cheated.",3
"The chews have helped me change my cholesterol and fat numbers for the better. I've ordered 3 containers from Amazon. The first two were great. When I opened the third batch, the wrappers on the chews were slightly sticky. The chews themselves were different from my first two experiences in that they were waxy and opaque on the surface. The waxy/stickiness made them difficult to unwrap and I tend to just have to squeeze them out of the wrapper. I'm guessing they were stored/transported at too high a temperature and melted at some point but really have no idea. I'm hoping that my next order is not like this one. We'll see.",3
"Working an hour from home, and driving home at 2:00 a.m., I'd hoped to find a wonderful new energy drink in the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KBW"">EBOOST Acai Pomegranate</a>. It's easily portable, and mixes with water so it can be quickly prepared.<br /><br />The EBOOST smelled great, though the mild flavor was a bit... watery.  It has a bit of a chemical aftertaste.<br /><br />Most disappointing was that, after drinking the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KBW"">EBOOST Acai Pomegranate</a>, I felt like I'd had a glass of water.<br /><br />For the price, the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KBW"">EBOOST Acai Pomegranate</a>, I'd hoped, would be a viable option to the canned energy drinks that do help somewhat. Unfortunately, I got about as much help as I would have from a glass of Crystal Light.  For now, I'll have to stick with the overpriced cans or with cups of espresso.",2
"This tea is pleasant and drinkable, not unlike a number of oriental green teas I've tried.<br /><br />I learned (after ordering) that all coca teas sold in the US are ""decocainized"" (check wikipedia... hence the ""export quality"" that appears on all of these coca teas.)<br /><br />So this is the coca-tea equivalent of decaf-coffee.  I certainly don't blame the sellers or the products for this unfortunate fact (although they certainly don't volunteer the info), I do blame those who have taken our freedoms to chose what we put in our bodies... thanks all you ""drug warriors"" for restricting what teas I can enjoy.<br /><br />I think many drinkers of these decocainized teas are waking up to the fresh smell of a tasty placebo. Sorry to spoil the party.<br /><br />So: two stars, because it's hard to feel good about paying $75 for what is essentially just green tea... even if it might ""help with digestion"".  I certainly have not found it to be better at waking me up in the morning than my usual yerba mate.",2
"The beef steak tips with mash potatoes is on the lower end of the Hormel line. The gravy, for once, is surprisingly not too salty but I've always suspected that if you take the salt away, all that would be left is blandness and that is exactly what happened here. I also really wish Hormel would stay away from the mashed potatoes. Sliced potatoes is fine because they tend to have texture if not taste but mashed potatoes really don't add anything to their dishes besides something mushy and tasteless to quickly fill your stomach. And the tiny bits of meat in here try their best to overcome the mountain of mashed potatoes but unfortunately aren't up for the job. It's not that this one is bad, per say, but it's just one of those meals that blends into all the rest without ever being noticeable.<br /><br />For what this is -- a non-perishable prepared food that is fairly cheap -- it's pretty good. It will fill you up quickly at very low effort and cost, but if you are going to compare it to something you can make yourself, well, there really isn't any comparison.",3
"I had high hopes for this product. you really need to use at least 2 packages to get enough flavor in a single cup if you're not adding any additional goodies to it.<br /><br />I like to make it in a coffee cup and add some shredded carrots and veggie crumbles to spruce it up a bit. since there are so many in the package it will last me quite a while and I can keep them in my locker on campus (law student) for when I am unexpectedly stuck there and not able to go home for a meal.<br /><br />It's quick, easy, low in calories and pretty cheap. so all in all it's a good value but I don't think it will be a staple in my pantry.",4
"So soft and chewy! It's a great snack for yourself and even your little ones! I recieved a free sample from influenster.com and this was the first thing that caught my eye. It has a great taste, and I can see myself buying more in the near future.",4
"After popping one of these in my mouth I couldn't help but taste the familiar caramel flavor immediately.  It is more of a subtle flavor after you are sucking on it for a while but overall it has a decent taste.  It is a hard candy, which is a little weird to get used to at first simply because when you taste caramel it is usually a soft handy.  When you get to the end there is a soft center that has a hint of coconut.  It is packed with 3 different vitamins so not only do you get the sugary treat of a caramel candy you also get a full dose of vitamins B and C (if you have three of them).  These are a hit and a miss for me.  On the one hand you get the nice caramel flavor, on the other it doesn't strike me as something that I will want to reach for again.",3
"Well, this wasn't too bad. I've never tried any of Starbucks' ""flavored"" coffees before, preferring the tar-like taste and consistency of their Pike Place and seasonal coffees. But this vanilla-flavored ""Natural Fusions"" ground coffee...man, that's something special. The vanilla bean flavor isn't overpowering, but it's not too subtle. It's the right median, just want I look for in a flavored blend. Just give me a hint of that flavor, don't hit me over the head with it. And did I mention how aromatic it is? Brew this, and it doubles as a Glade plug-in for your kitchen. Smells wonderful!",5
This coffee was very good and economical. I usually drink 2 or 3 cups so I need a coffee I enjoy but not teribly expensive. I would reccomend this coffee as it it one of the better breakfast blends.,4
"Growing up, I was a connoisseur of candy (or as some might call it, ""a child""). I have tasted many gummy bears over the years and none of them are as good as Haribo. I was introduced to Haribo during middle school/high school, by my German teacher. Now I'm addicted to them (and German candy in general). Haribo gummy bears are chewy but not sticky, so they don't leave sticky residue on your fingers. They're sweet but not too sweet, and the fruit flavors actually taste like the fruit they're supposed to taste like.<br /><br />A note on locating them - I find it odd that everyone seems to have trouble finding these in the United States. I don't know about the other states, but they're everywhere, here in Massachusetts. You can get them at any convenience store or Walgreens/CVS/whatever.<br /><br />And I might as well put my years of German classes to good use - the product description says that Haribo's ""catch phrase"" (Haribo macht Kinder froh / und Erwachsene ebenso) translates to: ""Kids and grown-ups love it so / the happy world of Haribo."" Actually, it translates to, literally: ""Haribo makes children happy / and adults as well.""",5
Are you supposed to avoid sugars if you have a urinary tract infection?,1
"I am a person that if my food smells off, I probably won't eat it. When I opened the wrapper, I got this funny whiff of odd sugary something... I know that is not the best explanation, but it was hard to pin down. Everything was stuck to the wrapper so maybe it gives off an odor when heated. Just a guess. In regards to the natural ingredients, I appreciated that they made sure to use as few fillers as possible. I would try another flavor anytime.",4
"I got this after reading about a study that said four cups of white tea a day - and no other changes to diet or exercise - could result in 4 to 8 lbs of weight loss in a year, and would actually reduce the number of fat cells in a person's body!  [...]<br /><br />One note: this tea is not just white tea, but has green tea as well.  While I don't object to the tea having green tea in it - the study suggested that green tea was also good for weight loss, but not as good as white - it's certainly not obvious from the name, and I feel a bit deceived.  If it's White & Green Tea, call it White & Green tea, not White tea.  That's the reason I knocked this down to 4 stars.<br /><br />For those that think that four cups of tea is a lot...  You're right.  But this tea is mild enough, and tasty enough, that I've been doing it for over a week and haven't gotten sick of it yet.  We'll see if that keeps up!",4
"There is nothing ""extra bold,"" or even ""regular bold"" about this coffee.  On the other hand, if you like your coffee meek and weak, you may well like this.  This comment isn't meant to suggest that my tastes are superior, I'm just stating that this is not ""extra bold"" at all.  If you want your coffee ""slap your face"" strong, try another Green Mountain flavor.  Dark magic, for example.",2
"Pop Secret is by far my favorite popcorn and I eat about 2 bags a day. I normally get the homestyle, but is was always to dry when I ordered on line so I went to the Butter thinking it wouldn't be so dry. No such luck. When I buy from the grocery store it is much more flavorable and fresh and it doesn't cost that much more. I checked the dates and the store vs online bulk was about 6 months different on average which probably causes the difference even though they both are in the sale by date range. with this said, I am going to have to discontinue buying this product online unless something changes and I'll really miss it coming straight to my door since I eat so much. I waited for 3 months of getting this product before posting because any company can have a bad batch of anything. Sorry. I hope this changes in the future!!",2
"We bought a case of these based on the positive reviews, but quite frankly no one who has tried it has liked it at all. It's a bit bitter, and the raspberry is tart tasting. Smells OK when it brews, but so far of all the people who have tried it (wife, myself, friends, relatives), no one has really liked it. So we have a half case of it sitting around collecting dust.",2
"I really would rather give this stuff three and a half stars, but I rounded up because my third grade math teacher said to round up for half or more. And I don't want her to think I didn't learn anything. She'll find me, just like she did all the others. The horror...<br /><br />Anyway, this stuff is pretty alright. What it lacks in the crispness of a 7-Up, it makes up for in flavor and not giving you diabetes if you chug the whole 24 pack in a week. Which, given the taste, is not impossible. The diet-y bluntness is still there from other flavors, and if you're used to 7-Up like I was, its pretty noticeable. But once you get used to it, its pretty good for lemon-lime, which I've never been a huge fan of in general. Drink it on the verge of freezing and finish before it gets warm, because when it does, it feels kind of like thin syrup.<br /><br />Should you buy some? If you want stevia-sweetened pop, sure. I do wish Amazon offered six or twelve packs instead of only twenty-four. I'd love to try out black cherry, but frankly, $25 is steep for me right now.",4
"I'd like to start by saying that I rarely leave negative reviews. I'd like to add that my dog isn't a picky eater. Now that that's out of the way, these apparently healthy vegan treats are hard (brittle might be a better word), have no enticing aroma, and are not appealing to my 2-year-old toy breed. I stupidly bought a bag of every flavor since the reviews were so positive and since vegan dog treats are relatively hard to find (I'm in Florida). Now I have 4-5 bags of these that I can't use. Annoying.",2
"I'm not sure whose fault this is, but one of the canisters exploded in the mail and it was a huge mess inside the box.  I had to spend a half an hour cleaning everything, which was a pain.  I lost half of the chocolate powder in one of the cans.<br /><br />The chocolate itself is so good that I had to special order it.  We don't have Coffee Beans where I live and I've missed the taste tremendously.  There is nothing like it.",3
"I tried the original flavor and loved them!  Can't wait to try the Caesar flavor.  Calories aren't too bad, the serving size is decent, pretty low in sodium as far as crispy snacks go and 5g of protein.  A yummy snack when you are looking for something ""chip-like"".",5
"While these chips are good, they are not the ones I was looking for and thought I was ordering.  Don't let the picture fool you.  These are NOT the Wheat Thins Chips Veggie that you get out of vending machines.  The picutre DOES NOT match what you will receive. You get the Garden Valley Veggie chips that you can easily find in any grocery store.  Those chips are good too - but they are not as good as the veggie chips found in vending machines.  I called the 1-800 number on the back of the package for Kraft foods and was told that ONLY food vendors received the product that I was looking for and they were not available to the general public.",3
"I am a coffee lover of many years and as such am always interested in finding good coffees.  This was my first time to try blue mountain, and purchasing it with a gift certificate allowed me to be a bit more extravagant than I otherwise would have been.<br /><br />While the coffee is good, I don't find it to be superior to other coffees I have ordered which are considerably less expensive.",3
"My brother bought a six-pack of this stuff, and I like lemon juice in my water, so I figured I would try it.<br /><br />Boy oh boy am I regretting it. I can see how some people might really enjoy this drink, but to me it was a bit like being punched in the mouth. It's at first mouth-puckeringly sour with just a little bit of that ""sparkling"" thing, then a strong, bitter undercurrent comes through, like eating the white pith of a citrus peel. Then, finally, once that subsides, this awful metallic aftertaste just sits on the tongue. And now my stomach is hurting from the acidity.<br /><br />If you like strongly-flavored things, you might enjoy this for sure. If you are expecting lemonade, or water with lemon juice, drink something else. This is more like bitter lemon juice with sparkling water.",3
"This coffee tastes very flavorful and is not too strong, but I have to say it almost ruined my months' old Keurig Personal Brewer. The coffee is ground so finely that when the K-Cups are punctured by the needles (top and bottom), it gets packed into the needles and also sifts out through the holes made by the needles, going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty ""sludge"" in the bottom of each cup. I purchased a pack of 2 (48 K-Cups) and didn't even use one full pack. I do not recommend this brand or blend. It is a waste of money, which is something I couldn't really afford at this time. I sent a letter of complaint to the Wolfgang Puck company and, except for a ""cookie cutter"" letter acknowledging receipt of my comment, I have not received any further contact from them.",1
"The taste is nice, but no matter how much powder you add it tastes a little watered down. Too costly for the item value.",3
"Sorry, but I wasn't terribly impressed by these light snack crackers. Okay, I admit that I never liked Oreos that much in the first place. This 100 calorie bag of thin snack crackers tastes like Oreos, for sure--minus the sugar high pasted in the traditional sandwich cookie filling. But as one other reviewer noted, they're not all that chocolaty, a critical flaw in the opinion of this chocoholic. Worse than that, they're not so good for you. If you're going to have 100 calories, there are a lot healthier ways to do so than devoting nearly 40 percent to sugar. For my money, a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense. It not only costs less, it's got lots more nutritional value, not to mention fibre.",3
"My family has an eight year old Yorkie who has experienced significant joint problems in both his shoulders and hips.  He is used to eating glucosamine treats to help alleviate these issues but these treats have to be broken in to several pieces for him because of his small size (6 pounds).  This ""motion"" powder can be sprinkled on the dog's food and a teaspoonful is the serving size for small dogs (under ten pounds).  A disadvantage to me of this product is it has to be refrigerated after opening and our dog's eating area is a long way from the kitchen.  Our dog did readily eat the stuff when mixed with his regular food but I think he still prefers the glucosamine he has been receiving in the forms of treats for the last few years.",3
I recently purchased this after using Lavazza for years.  Wanted to get an organic bean.  If you like strong espresso this bean is not for you.  It is maybe the strength of a french roast but not an espresso roast. I am returning to Lavazza until further notice! Buyer beware!,1
"When I initially ordered this Whiskas Perfectly Chicken for my cats, they liked it OK. They did not wolf it down, but they would eat it without complaint.<br /><br />THE FELINE EEDING SCENARIO AT MY HOME:<br /><br />My Kitties always have kibble out and eat that freely. In the moring the two of them share one can of wet food and in the evening, each cat gets his own can or pouch.<br /><br />I rotate their wet food meals so that they do not have a constant diet of any one flavor of Product. I have had cats all my life and if there is one thing I deal poorly with, it is ""THE LOOK FROM THE CAT which says ""Are you out of your mind? Have you lost your senses? Were you born yesterday? Do YOU NOT RECALL that I Do Not Care for That?"" It can, of course, be that this attitude has developed onvernight and I am to be a cat whisperer/mind reader and know this ahead of time. But I hate that whole scenario. In my opinion, I have two overly spoiled cats who live in the lap of luxury with cat trees, cat condos, cat toys, and dry and wet cat food! Water too! Their buddy, whom I feed also, is a feral kitty and he dang well eats what there is. There is no THE LOOK from him. So I try, at all costs, to avoid THE LOOK!<br />To that end, the cats are offered a variety of wet foods. Kibble is a constant, but I try to make the wet food a treat and a time of relaxation and enjoyment. So, the Purfectly Chicken was offered about two times a week. Other varieties and other flavors were offerred at other times.<br />I put the Purfectly Chicken on ""Subscibe and Save"" and had it delivered every three months, so I know they were not overwhelmed with this food. But after 6 months, the noses went up and I got THE LOOK. So, I took the Chicken off ""Subscribe and Save"" for a year or more. Then, I was looking for something ""different"" to order and saw the Chicken on my old list and decided to try it again. No dice. One pouch of the plain chicken and I got THE LOOK. A couple of weeks later, I sneaked in the Chicken and Beef:  THE LOOK. Well, the feral cat really, really likes the Chicken and Duck, but I can't be buying special stuff just to keep him happy. He will have to stick with the large cans of Friskies (except of course when I feel sorry for him and sneak in the Purfectly Chicken after a run to the local grocery store).<br />So, I gave The Purfectly Chicken a fair shot with my kitties. It just isn't something they like. No accounting for taste! But, since they seem to live in their own happy, finicky world, they have told me to give Purfectly Chicken only three stars. They say they would eat it if they were truly Starving, but, hopefully, we won't have that happen and will just continue to accommodate their wishes with other wet foods.<br /><br />On the positive side, Mr. Feral Kitty has been living in my back yard for four years. (It is his choice to remain outdoors and living the wild life. But, he has progressed to the point that he appears at the back door at 5:00 PM and patiently waits until 5:30. Past that time, he begins to cry and let me know that he IS HUNGRY!) He eats once a day. His vote for Purfectly Chicken is 5 Stars. (He likes it because of the great amount of gravy and the large chunks of real meat.)<br /><br />So I have split the difference and given the product 4 Stars. Two cats give me THE LOOK. One cat really enjoys this product. If your cat is a true Chicken Lover, I believe he or she will like it quite well.<br /><br />Just FYI: My two spoiled kitties have decided that they prefer ProPlan which has Some Gravy and Small Chunks of food. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003R0LLYY"">Pro Plan Canned Cat Food, Adult Salmon and Rice Entr&eacute;e In Sauce (Pack of 24 3 Ounce Cans)</a> I am well trained enough to realize that they do not care for Pate!<br /><br />I happens to be December 2011 as I am writing this, so I wish each of you a Blessed Holiday Season and and a Happy New Year!

This item was gift and the receiver loved it. Unfortunately after a year of use the motor is seizing and does not grind up food anymore.<br />For the price I believe it should have lasted longer.,3
"After reading the reviews you would have thought this was a great tasting product! Right? It's a step above a plain rice cake with a few mini chocolate chips! That's it! I read all the review and thought this was a no brainer and I purchased 4 boxes. I gave a few to my office associates and got their opinion too! When you open of package it smells like dark mocha. When you bite into it we thought it had no flavor and at best was like a plain rice cake!  One person thought it tasted like ""dirt"". And after thinking about it a while I agree! Dry texture and dry mocha flavor. Well, you be the judge. I think all the positive reviews were from those who have been locked up for a while and recently released or those who think rice cakes are delicious!!",2
"First thing out of many , many purchases over the years that I wasted my money on. I went by the reviews. Honestly I looked forward to this and then I smelled it.  It smelled bad. I mean REALLY ""OFF"". I couldn't get past the smell. I passed it to  my husband and he eats anything but one mouthful and he was done. The rice would have been okay on its own so we will throw the vegetable stuff away and just keep the ""expensive"" rice. I have eaten Indian many times so the smell was not due to the spices.",1
This apple butter has a great taste but the price is so I would not purchase again. I know it can not cost this much to produce such a small jar,4
My  dogs love them.. They are pricey for a treat tho!<br />I did not notice any change on their teeth -plaque stayed the same.. even tho I gave it to my  dog 2 times a day for few months. Still needed to go to the vet for  deep teeth cleaning.,3
"The flavor of the tea is okay.  I've had other green tea that had a better, more flavorful taste.  This one blends lemon grass and so that may be the after taste I'm experiencing.  I added honey to the tea but it still had a bit of an after taste.  This tea is not horrible, but the flavor is not extraordinary either.",3
"The only thing that will bring my dogs in the house immediately. If I call ""chicken"" they come running.  Rattling the canister will even tear them away from squirrels and rabbits.",5
"Before giving up on your wireless thermometer, try replacing the probe!  I'm on my third probe now, which is frustrating, but these things are only $15 bucks.  A new 'Grill Alert' is $70!  Each probe that I've had seems to last a few years before I start getting screwy readings.  When I replace the probe, the unit works fine again.  I think the probes are only rated to 400 degrees, so that's definitely the weak link in this otherwise excellent system.  Now I'm ordering two probes, just so that I can have a spare ready to go.",4
I've been forced to drink coconut water daily and have found many different types out there. This one is good but there are definitely others that are better. Must be consumed ice cold to be tasty.,3
"I noticed that some people said that eating one was enough, but that's probably because of the taste. I've tried two other flavors of it before, one was chocolate, and I never liked them at all. I don't understand why some people say that it tastes like a candy bar, it looks really pretty, but then when you actually it bite into, it's terrible, b/c it's all mushy inside. Maybe buy one to try it, but don't buy in bulk unless you're sure you like it",2
"I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, ""Holistic"",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or ""natural"" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?",2
"Normally I love walnuts, however I regret this purchase.  The nuts are coated in a savory seasoning with paprika, garlic, and veggie flavoring.<br />I was expecting something sweet or plain which I could throw on my morning oatmeal.<br />However, they aren't a bad product, if you like salted and seasoned nuts.  I can only compare it to garden vegetable flavored crackers. The quality is decent overall, just not a flavor I enjoy.  The packaging is lightweight and portable, which is nice to grab on the go for snacking.",2
"While it does not have as much BAM as I expected, it is still an interesting product.",3
"This stuff is amazing. You can have great tasting chai for a fraction of the cost. Just make sure you refrigerate them after you open them. It says so on the package, but it is printed in a weird place and very small.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys chai lattes. (Chai + milk)",4
"Cute idea for a 50th gift, but the soft candy was hard, perhaps indicating somewhat not fresh. Would buy again if this issue was solved.",2
"First and foremost, let me make it clear that this item was received free to test and review through Amazon Vine Voice in May.  I have no idea how long ago this was packed together.  Nothing appears to be stale.<br /><br />The packaging was a plain cardboard box with a thin cardboard insert that takes up the length & width of the box, in an attempt to make it look like there's a wrapped Christmas package inside.  The whole thing was nicely protected for shipping.<br /><br />I've never had Cheese Straws before and wasn't sure what to expect.  They seem to be a cross between a thick cracker and a cookie.  These are Aged Cheddar by Sonoma Cheese.  The taste is pretty strong and be prepared for a hot feeling in your mouth afterward.  The package contains 2 servings.<br /><br />Three Pepper Water Crackers contains 4 servings that have the pepper visible on the crackers.  A thin, dry cracker that has a mild taste.<br /><br />Sonoma Jacks Parmesan Peppercorn gourmet cheese wedges have 6 individually wrapped wedges.  The main ingredients listed are Monterey Jack and Parmesan cheese.  A somewhat plastic/rubbery texture, although the taste is okay; nothing special.  A small cheese knife/spreader is included.<br /><br />Beth's Chocolate Chip Cookies are bite-sized with 2 servings.  The cookies appear to have a somewhat breaded coating on them that poured out of the package as crumbs.  The cookies themselves were intact and I liked the taste.<br /><br />Brown & Haley Cashew Roca.  These were really good and are doubly wrapped for freshness.  Too bad there are only 3 in the package.<br /><br />Nunes Farms Roasted Almonds with Sea Salt.  I generally eat plain almonds so I was happy to find that the salt is very light and added just enough to make these more interesting.  3 servings per package.<br /><br />1 sleeve of Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Hot Cocoa Mix.  I'm saving this for later.<br /><br />2 Ghirardelli Chocolate squares with Caramel filling.  It's Ghirardelli.  Enough said.<br /><br />1 Napa Valley Mustard Co Hot Sweet Mustard.  Label claims it's rich with honey; the main ingredient is sugar but honey is listed in there as well.  I really don't understand why this was included in the box.  There isn't anything to try it out on so this hasn't been tasted yet.<br /><br />As of this writing the price appears to be $39.99.  I just can't see myself purchasing this as a gift at that price.",3
"I didn't expect to get so many treats!!! They're small but perfect for training, and my dog loves them! She already learned how to roll over and play dead with these treats. Definitely worth the price. Buy the 1 pound, peanut butter bag, and your dog will love you!",5
Mango can use more flavor but still great & the macadamia nuts in it are large & taste great! Chewy & crunchy! Best tasting fruit & nut bar by far! Reminds me of being back in Hawaii!,5
I love fact that this drink is neither too tangy or tos sweet.The combimation of both is perfect and therefore quenches yor thirst  without leaving an unpleant after taste. t,2
"I tried this flavor since Nestle appears to have stopped making my favorite, Double Chocolate Meltdown.  This flavor is not as watered down as the Rich flavor, and for that I'm glad.  However, as a dark chocolate lover and someone who enjoys a true, deep chocolate taste, I was disappointed.  This flavor is more bitter than bittersweet.  It did not satisfy my palette, and it's unlikely that I will purchase any more of the current Nestle hot chocolate flavors.",2
"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 4:43 Mins<br /><br /></span>After experimenting with grocery store-type dog foods I settled on one sold by my vet. However, I thought that this brand might be worth trying. You will see from my video review that not all dogs are fond of it. I thought that it was just okay and the ingredient list is not very impressive. I hope that you enjoy my video.",3
"Our Lab puppy was able to figure out how to turn the red bar and left the dispenser lids, but the angle of the treat pod is such that she can't fit her snout, or manuvuer her tongue very well to get the food.  Even turning her snout sideways didn't help.  The idea has promise but unfortunately the design is lacking.  We'll keep trying but it doesnt really hold her interest since she can't get the reward.",1
"Newman's Own Organics Premium Dog Treats were thought to be something that my two dogs (minature daschunds) would enjoy, however Heidi, the older of the two dogs will not eat these treats. She is usually eager to get treats but she turns up her nose to these.  Max, the other dog will eat almost anything so he's getting to partake of the entire purchase.  I will not be reordering any more of this treat because I need something that both dogs enjoy.",3
"Now I know where all the K cups that no one would buy go. Largely not coffee cups. Some of the flavors included were Island Coconut (really?) , chocolate glazed donut, fudge, vanilla, eggnog, caramel apple, blueberry, spiced apple, caramel crime, cinnamon roll, French toast, pecan and toffee. This is not what I call a 'coffee' assortment but rather a bunch of awful flavored instant drink mixes. Add to that the fact that the expiration dates are only 2 months away and it is one bad deal.",1

"I use this in my smoothies with maca, fresh fruit and hemp powder.  This is the chocolate is better than plain cocoa powder. Good price and shipping too.  Thank you.",5
Good product.  Another ready made solution for getting those difficult dogs to pill medicated.,4
"I have to say that this stuff definitely smells like it did indeed come out of some backwoods swamp or something. It doesn't smell horrible like green tripe or anything like that, but just smells swampy. Anyway, regardless of what I think, my dog loves it, and it did actually help him put on a couple pounds, which was my purpose for getting it. Beaver is supposed to be high quality food with a high calorie content. I wouldn't feed this to my dog all the time, but I'd buy it again.",4
"Sure hope they keep making this product - just a light topping of vanilla yogurt baked onto the breakfast fast... not like the sticky sweet artificial berry flavored toppings ... and the bar is softer and chewy, not hard and brittle like some others. just the right size for a quick snack, whether on the bus or at your desk. Good for a quick pick-me-up in the afternoons, too, to get you through the day, or on a long drive somewhere.",4
My father got these as a gift from work & they are absolutely delicious. Very smooth & creamy. There are three different flavors in the package & my favorite became the hazelnut. I would definitely order these again when they run out.,4
"Very pricey, too little for to much I'd say but very tasty and if you need a good gluten free dairy free egg free cookie go for it.",4
"Tasty Bite has become my least favorite brand of shelf-stable retort-packaged Indian meals. The Bombay Potatoes are a pleasant surprise after some of the other meals such as the syrupy Thai entrees.  (The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5DKLM"">Tasty Bite Entree, Punjab Eggplant, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> is another one I like.)<br /><br />The potatoes and chickpeas have retained a sufficient amount of texture.  The sauce is thin but has a pleasant spiciness and there is plenty of it, which I don't mind because it is pretty good, especially compared to some of the other ones I have tried.  You can add leftover potato, chickpeas, or even green beans to this meal and I like to serve it with brown rice and garnish with diced chili peppers.<br /><br />The entire package is supposed to be two servings but is realistically one. The total contents have 820mg of sodium, 6g of dietary fiber, 8g of fat, and 1g of saturated fat. The meal is vegan and is certified kosher.",4
"I've come to the conclusion that I'm just not a big fan of these things... I'll definitely say that Mango Peach Mio was better than other flavors I've tried though! It tasted like a glass of juice, and the flavor wasn't half bad. I don't understand how it can recommend only a few drops though- for one, it takes about 20x that amount to actually get any flavor in the drink! For another, one of my biggest issues with these Mio things is that I can't get it to do a ""drop"". You squeeze it until it shoots out as a jet. I haven't managed to get it to just do a ""drop"". The peach flavor is a bit strong in comparison to the mango, and definitely is that artificial candy-type peach, not real peach flavor. All in all, I found this flavor drinkable, although it still wasn't as good as just buying some juice. It was still more drinkable than the ""sweet tea"" flavor, which was absolutely disgusting!",3
"After reading the 1st review, I thought this hot sauce is hot according to this person.  I was looking for HOT, (hot in the true sense of the word)sauce,so I decided to try it.  I feel it was a waist of my money and I actually paid $10.00 for the one I purchased.  On the first try, I had to pour 1/3 of the bottle on my rice before I actually got the taste of hot in my mouth.<br /><br />So if you are looking for HOT this is not your pepper sauce. I sure won't purchase it again.",1
"I can only call this stuff ""jerky-esque,"" because it is really not like any ""real"" jerky that I've ever had before. Easy to bite through and chew, but extremely processed and pressed into form. As alluded to in another review, the look and texture of the these is very reminiscent of jerky-treats that are made for dogs. Overall, I'd give the texture 2.5-3 stars....different...a bit odd...ok, but not really ""meaty.""<br /><br />Taste, I'd give 2 stars. They rate as edible, but certainly not good. Eating a full serving at one time tends to feel like a chore, so that should tell you right there that these things aren't too great. Not horrible, but not something I'd prefer to eat...<br /><br />Value. Decent, but in a subjective sense. You get a lot of product for the price....which is great if you happen to like them....but nothing to crow about if you don't....",2
"I bought this product through amazon, because its not easy to get organic travel size applesauce where I live. I love the product. My package came damaged I believe due to not enough packing materiel around the sauces.  I called amazon and they took care of it quickly and are sending me another one. Very pleased with Amazon's customer service. I would order again.",3
"Great cereal, but it's not organic.  Neither my fresh package from a local store nor Arrowhead Mills' website labels this cereal as organic.  Either Amazon is getting product packaged especially for them, or the organic label on this listing is erroneous.",4
"Ordered this for my Husband back in June and he said they were all flat.  It taste as if the cans had been opened and left in the frig.  We are going to try one more time, maybe we just got a bad batch.  Will come back and let you know.  I don't know how long they stay in the warehouse, we'll see.",3
"Best lollipops I've ever tasted, you can tell from the list of ingredients that these aren't going to taste fake/artificial.  Perfect when you're craving something sweet, great when you're feeling nauseous.  I don't have any kids, I bought these for myself and have given packs away to friends who were very happy to receive them.  A big plus for being organic and for not leaving a weird aftertaste in your mouth.  All the flavors included in these packs - Mango Tango, Pomegranate Pucker, Tooberry Blueberry and Wet-Face Watermelon, were equally tasty.  Some reviewers criticized the fact that these are made in Mexico - what's up with that?  Nothing.  These are simply the best lollipops out there!!!",5
"This tea is overpriced. At asian markets, retail is $6.95. Certainly, wholesale is drastically less. The price asked for here is appalling. It's the exact same tea and Foojoy is considered one of the lesser brands in teas. The product is great, the seller? Doubtful.",4
My dog LOVES this food. He follows us around at meal time till he gets his food and then never leaves his dish till it's gone.,5
"The text says it's 2.25 lbs, and the equivalent of 85 eggs.<br /><br />the directions say 2 tbsp on powdered egg + 4 tbsp of water equals one egg.<br /><br />the nutritional information says one serving is 2 tbsp and that there are 78 servings in the can.<br /><br />what happened to the other 7 eggs???",3
"Will not be buying this flavor again.  My 10 month old will not eat it.  It is very thick, especially after being kept in the fridge after opeing.",1
"This is a good olive oil at a good price, but I was disappointed at how poorly packaged it was for shipping. Both tins arrived dented, one minorly and one substantially.",3
"If you love Salt and Vinegar chips then you can't help but love these almonds, they are sooooooooooooooooooooo good!  Yes, the almonds have fat (much like chips) but at least its a good fat for you!",5
I train and race with Gu.  I never feel jittery or sick; it just makes me feel like I can KEEP RUNNING.  It's wonderful.  Just like natural energy.  And the chocolate outrage tastes like chocolate frosting!  Yumm!,5
"And Dutch I am,the double salty ""Dropjes"" is like taking a sip of the North sea,there was enough in the shipment for me to hide some in every crook&cranny in my house,car and in a special box to keep in my pocket at all times.<br /><br />Try it,you might like it.",3
"Nestle Tollhouse Semi Sweet Morsels they are the best, I love them and eat them right out of the bag, delicious chocolate chips, I make all kinds of bake goods with them, chocolate chip cookies, Muffins one of my favorite Brands to use when I make chocolate pies and they would suffer with out them. Even though the are so good they are a little pricey here, I get the 12 oz. bags at my local grocer for a little less price, I guess you pay for convenience, Semi sweet chocolate  morsels they bake the very Best! Thank You",5
"I bought these at a local Winco, after bringing them home, I read that little ""made in China"" part, and now I don't want to eat them for fear of getting lead poisoning.",1
I bought a bunch of these for my mom so she can make persian ice cream.  Received on time and package was very organized.,5
"I was expecting these to taste close to Maynards wine gums, but they simply just don't. That said, they're enjoyable. The pieces are bigger and denser than their Maynards counterpart. The flavors are *as* distinguishable if you don't look at the color before eating, but they're still pretty good.",4
"Love the Pamela's pancake mix. We are using it in every dish that requires some kind of flour or bread crumbs - casseroles,  cakes, omelets, crapes...<br />We have tried several mixes and this one is the best so far. Highly recommend!",5
"Better than the Knorr version.  Like most bouillon, probably about as healthy as eating salt.  But so very tasty.  (I've only used the cubes so far)<br /><br />UPDATE  Have now used the shaker bottle, yummy!  One note, unless you plan to spoon it out, tape the non shaker side down, or you will accidentally open that side and get too much out.  You can always unscrew to use a spoon.",4
"We loved the Hodgson Mill 9 grain and honey wheat breads but I hope I just got a bad box in the case of the Jalapeno Cornbread I ordered.  There is so much baking powder and/or soda in this mix that it tastes like soap.  No Jalapeno flavor.  I'm going to add a can of corn, some mild cheddar and some jalapenos to the next box I open and hope that it improves; no one ate more than one bite of the first box I baked.  I just can't justify giving more than one star to a mix you have to remake.",1
"I bought these for myself. Running around mommy and working I don't eat because I don't have time. Then my steam runs out and I think ""why the hell didn't I eat?"" My mom is a type 1 diabetic and she found these and now she can't keep her hands off of them. She said she doesn't feel hungry as quick. Now my husband has found them. Geez! I have had one package that was a little more gooey but most of the time they are drier tasting. Personally I don't want it to be gooey. I am on a subscription of these through Amazon and I need to increase the amount. My kids haven't tried them...I am sure they are next except they are picky eaters.",5
"I've been on a G.F. diet for 7 years so I don't have unrealistic expectations of G.F. products. I was very disappointed in these bars. They are hard and dry. If I didn't know from the box they are supposed to be peanut butter, I wouldn't guess it from the taste. Not something I'll ever purchase again.",2
"These breakfast cookies are delicious! They have a fresh ginger taste, and they really do keep you full. I usually have a small snack about two hours after breakfast, but since eating these, I don't feel hungry again for at least 4 hours. At 290 calories, I would recommend them to anyone who needs a quick, healthy breakfstt.",5
I bought this item on a deal and because it had good reviews. I am not very impressed by this. The taste is ok. I have tried 2 flavors. The taste is very artificial and close to same. I would not recommend to buy it.,3
"Expensive, nasty and low in protein! I really don't understand how this product has got good reviews. I am not exagerating but the taste is nasty. I drunk it once and the rest I flushed through the toilet. Bad!",1
I love lima beans but these are a little off for some reason. Maybe because I'm used to frozen and its the taste of the can? I will go back to the frozen or dried. At least these are not lined with the BPH plastic that leaches into your food!,3
I bought this for my daughter who is a fan of the Harry Potter movies.  She got a laugh out of it.  The flavors are just as horrible as they said in the movie.,4
"I add a serving of PB2 to non-fat yogurt for a protein boost, use it to make a lower fat Thai-style peanut hot sauce, and add it to desserts.  If I bothered to read recipes, there would be more delicious and healthy uses.  We're going through our second case.  It is much more economical to buy by the case.",5
"My dog (mixed breed) loves these treats! He like a lot of different kinds but can tell when I am getting him a marrow bone and gets extra excited, they are a nice size treat, probably best for a medium to large size dog.",5
I used to be a coffee addict but now I'm addicted to Teeccino.  I like the vanilla nut flavor better than the original but the chocolate is probably my favorite.  I brew it like coffee and drink it black since it has a nice flavor.,5
"I'm a former Marine, got out after 8 years, did two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. I was first introduced to beef jerky during MCT (Marine Combat Training)...which is where you learn warfighting techniques. For those LONG, sweaty, depressingly hot days in NC...this was an excellent snack. Beef Jerky is nutritious, low in fat content and tastes great! It also is a great chewy snack for those 'hurry-up-and-wait' days. Perhaps the biggest benefit for me was the salt....if you're out in the sun all day, you lose a lot of sweat....the Marine Corps motto should be 'drink water'...but as for electrolytes/ salt....this snack does an excellent job. I love the peppered taste...probably because I'm Jamaican. The 1.5-ounce snack size fits perfectly in your pocket and works out to be about half the price you'd pay at the gas station (thanks Amazon). I have a couple of buddies over in Afghanistan and I sent each two packs....for them and to pass around to their troops...they love it.<br />For a healthy snack (especially if you're very active and sweat a lot)this is a great product.<br />If there was one complaint....I wish the desiccant that is inside every bag was somehow shaped differently.....if you grab a handful in the bottom...you'll never know that you grabbed the desiccant too....luckily I've been able to catch it!",5
"This company is scamming everyone.  They put instant coffee in a k-cup and pass it off as real brewed coffee.  I purchased their Dark roast to try it out.<br />The first thing I noticed was how lite the k-cup felt.  If you shake it, it sounds like a little snarl drum.  As it brews, you get a real dark thick mixture of water and coffee, and then only water.  When it was done I opened the k-cup.  No coffee grounds, No filter, Nothing inside, completely empty.  The coffee is only for 8 oz. cups, any larger and it is watered down coffee.  Even at 8 oz., the coffee didn't taste good. (that's my personal opinion on the taste)  Overall:  You're getting low quality instant coffee at fresh brewed prices.  Shame on Grove Square.",1
"I love chocolate, and I love cookies, so I was excited to try these cookies.  I was particularly looking forward to a gooey center filled with fudge, as depicted by the large picture on the package.  I was disappointed.  There is a thin, disc-shaped chocolate-colored center in these cookies, but it is certainly not gooey.  Really, it's more like putty, and it doesn't have any discernable chocolate flavor.  The rest of the cookie is chalky in texture and also has no recognizable chocolate flavor.  Personally, I prefer the regular, old fashioned Chips Ahoy cookies over this new gooey version.",2
"Have purchased the same item at Costco for 60% of the price from this vendor--same experience with most other products of this type, to say nothing of nuts.  Go to Costco.",2
"When I ordered a week ago, no other reviews existed.<br /><br />So let's set the stage as they say.  It's 3:00am and the guilt from watching the last P90X infomercial while eating ice cream had just worn off.  Suddenly as if Billy Maze himself had yelled it through my TV - I got the craving for some Peanut Brittle.<br /><br />Not being one who needs instant gratification I turned to my old friends at Amazon. I figured ... If I were to order food, sight unseen ... peanut brittle in fact, it seems reasonable to order form a company called THE PEANUT COMPANY of Virginia.<br /><br />Well - The items arrives well wrapped and protected from Amazon with no visible damage to the outside of the box. The contents however were a different story.<br /><br />Which is kind of the disappointment here. The brittle arrived in such small pieces that a lot of it being simply brittle dust. On what pieces were not completely incinerated you were lucky to have maybe 1-2 actual peanuts, These were caramelized and stale like the rest of the product reminiscent of something your grandmother put out  when surprised by an unexpected distant relative.<br /><br />Now it is possible - that The Peanut Company of Virginias has one employee who suffers from an extreme peanut allergy as to only be able to toss in 11 peanuts into the brittle mix before having to run for their inhaler and in running coincidentally tripped and crushed the box of brittle... and in his dismay, hid the box for 4 years in shame before it was accidentally found and used to fulfill my order. But ...there is also the possibility, that if you like real peanut brittle your better off buying from a store where you can see the product first. See my pic<br /><br />Good Chomping :-)",2
"I found the Crystal Light Mojito Moctail to be pretty good.  Although it has the ""artificial sweetner aftertaste"", it is pretty slight - and this is from someone who avoids diet drinks like the plague.  Since I've never had a Mojito, I wasn't sure what to expect from the taste.  However, it was a very pleasant blend of Crystal Light's standard Lemonade with a hint of Mint and Lime.  My 7 and 10 yr old children were even able to independently tell me without coaching what added flavors were in the drink.  One said ""I taste something minty"" and the other said ""I think there's lime in here too"", so Crystal Light obviously did a good job on the blend.  They obviously also did a good job on the overall drink because my kids drank an entire pitcher while I was at work.  And I thought I was getting the drink for the wife and I...",4
"I'm an avid hot chocolate drinker, and this is just doesn't measure up.  It reminds me of the sugar free Swiss Miss.  No matter what size you set your cup on, it's just missing that cocoa flavor.  Maybe the dark chocolate would be better.  I personally like the Cafe Escapes Milk Chocolate better!<br /><br />I bought a 24 pack, and then I was able to find it at my local grocery store, so I bought another one.  Now, I'm stuck with the 24 pack.",2
"This product tastes just like regular peanut butter. It is great on protein shakes for an extra boost of protein. I highly recommend this product. It is, however, extremely overpriced on Amazon. Found this for 3.29 at a local store. Good luck!",5
"We love earth's best organic baby food, but this is not the tastiest one. I've tried it myself and think it is pretty gross. But my daughter still eats it, just not with as much enthusiasm as other flavors. It's got a decent amount of protein, which is important for us as a vegetarian family.",4
"The wasabi flavor was not as strong as I like. I have had others (in the large 39 ounce plastic jar from Costco that were better, but they are no longer available.  These are an adequate substitute.  The smaller container is handy.<br /><br />PK",3
This is the second time I have ordered from Mo's and I will continue to do so.  The fudge is fresh and creamy just as if I had made it myself.  Since I no longer bake Mo's has become my go to shop for fudge.  I would recommend their fudge to anyone.,5
"I was super excited to get hot chocolate for my keurig.. and clearly I bought the wrong brand.  This is the nastiest hot chocolate I have ever had in my entire life.  It tastes like some kind of weird, prune juice hot water chemical chocolate thing.  It's absolutely horrible and I am mad I spent the money that I did when I could have just squeezed some syrup in a cup of milk and heated in the microwave.  That'd be gourmet compared to this nasty crap.  gross!!!",1
Anna Linguini #7 is an excellent pasta product made and packaged in Italy. It is not carried by any of our supermarkets and as a result I placed an order for 20 one pound packages via Amazon to restock our pantry. The order arrived in a timely fashion but it looked like the original cardboard shipping container was drop kicked all the way from Italy. The box was ripped in a number of locations and the food product was exposed. Three of the the one pound bags were torn and had to be disposed of. Email to Amazon with a complaint must have been lost in transmission because I received no response. Next time I'll travel up to New York to buy my Anna Linguini. New Yorkers treat linguini with a lot more respect than Amazon does.,2
"I agree with all the reviews about the price. It's really ridiculous that the appeal of this machine for our family was the cost of soda vs. the cost of this stuff. It' is 1/3 the price per serving of store bought soda, 1/2 the caffeine, 1/3 the sugar and calories, but it still tastes amazing. And we don't have bags and bags of recycling, and we can make whatever soda we want when we want. At this price, it's basically just buying 3 cases of soda on sale... what's the point??? When you can order it online from ANYWHERE ELSE for half the price, this is just absurd. Please just search for it, you'll find a better price in about 10 seconds.",2
"Our 5 year old (healthy) pomeranian took these, although I could tell they were not his favorite treats, and ate them over a period of about a month.  I began to notice that his gums began to be sore, and he was having tenderness in his mouth.  I took him to our vet to have his teeth checked, and discovered that several of his teeth had become loose, and he had to have two of the front bottom ones extracted, and 5 more molars extracted.  A third (front tooth) is just hanging there tonight. The vet told me that several more were loose, and he could have pulled more.  I am heart sick that I fed these to my pomeranian....hindsight being what it is, they are way to hard for his little mouth and his teeth.  I thought I was HELPING him by giving him ""Denta Shield"" and instead he lost several of his teeth!  The small ones (for dogs up to 15 pounds) seemed OK for our bigger golden retriever, but are way to hard and thick for a small dog.  :(",1
Delicious!  Much better than the stuff I bought at Costco.  Unfortunately the shipping/taxes cost as much as the actual popcorn.  I probably won't order again.,4
"The ingredients are pretty impressive, but I am not sold. First off, the packaging of this is very wasteful, 3/4 of the container is empty..making you feel totally ripped off! My 7 year old wont drink without being mixed with some sort of milk, which you really have to blend because the powder doesnt dissolve well. A well balanced, largely plant based diet is really the best route to go in the long run. The quantity and price of this product is a joke.",2
"I ordered the small and my little maltese loves it!  She licks it, carries it around, bounces it, etc.  But the other dog tried to get the treat out and when she couldn't (and she's pretty tough)-- she lost interest.<br /><br />I'm leaving off a star because I think the price point is too high.  I've had just as much success entertaining and stimulating my dogs with other treat balls...like the Omega orange ball.  That one can be filled with a treat(food) of your choice and you're not bound to buy one specific filler.",4
"My wife and I bought this product with the intentions of using it for the coffee machine we own (Gourmet-Coffee cafe), little did we know that the product (when it arrived) would not fit our machine :-(  , we were so sad to find this out. Adding to the torture-the instructions where in german.  This company needs to put more specifications about its product, so that people like us have less trouble when buying. I would recommend this product but not for the people who have our type of machine. I also forgot to mention that we opened the package. Can we return this product ?-if we can, we will delete this review.",1
"My initial review was going to be... this is water! Tastes like water!<br />However, it has an actual particular metallic and nasty aftertaste. Drinking it straight from the plastic bottle. Maybe it's the added ""electrolytes"" which is actually just a bit of chemicals. But this water doesn't taste very natural.",2
"These black beans are low in sodium, black beans are healthy for you. The taste of these beans...well its really quite flavorless but i guess it can be a good thing..atleast they dont taste bad. They fit in good with my strict diet, i am losing weight in order to enlist in the airforce..so far so good.",4
"I agree with the others who mentioned this is the worse tasting of all the Celsius drinks.  The price was so cheap so I decided to purchase.  I almost threw up on the first try and couldn't even drink the rest.  Its smell wasn't even appetizing.  But if you decide to keep it and drink it, I would recommend eating a banana or something after drinking to remove that lingering taste off your tongue.",1
"My daughter and I have a lot of fun using her easy bake oven, but she would much rather cook for real with me.  Also, the mixes are really expensive for the small amount they make.",4
This is such a rip off!!!! You can get a case for $25 at Whole foods or a health food store. Reach out to your local grocer and request them to order it directly from the Vendor. Don't be foolish in paying this price!,1
"As a kid, I loved Kool-Aid and still to this day, the tast of Kool-Aid Lemonade brings back memories of Summer afternoons. But I'm just not digging this new Peach Mango flavor. It was quite peachy in flavor, I couldn't really taste the mango part of the drink. Apart from the easy to read and understand directions, I don't have too much to say about the drink. It just wasn't to my taste but others may enjoy the flavor a lot more.",2
"If you eat this stuff then you know why you buy it and this is a good deal (I think). If you don't you should, try it you might like it!",4
"I made 2 packs of this muffin mix, and made mini muffins. When I mixed it up, I noticed there were hardly any chocolate chips in the packages.<br />We've eaten 15 of the 30 mini muffins, and only found TWO chocolate chips. It doesn't look like there are any in the remaining ones either. I will be calling Better Crocker in the morning to voice this complaint. My children were very disappointed",2
"I was suckered into buying these cause it was the only ones i saw in a store one time that said they were San Marzano.  THEY ARENT!  let me repeat THEY ARENT.<br />You have to double check, like i did after using these... cause I have used other San Marzano tomatoes before in the past and they were delicious and sweet and packed with flavor.  These were acidic, bordering on no flavor and even their color was way off compared to the real ones.<br />These said they were grown in Canada... Im sorry but Canada is not Italy, you need to have the ones from the San Marzano region where they are grown and have an official seal from the government of Italy to say they are ""True"" San Marzano tomatoes.  I went to another store and noticed that Cento have that seal, if you dont believe me, Google it... cause it will show what seals need to be there from the Italian Government.  The Cento brand are quite good the money, i paid $3.50 a can for those compared to the $4.19 for these fake ones.  They are great for sauces or even just put straight on Pizza with a little sea salt.  Save your money and buy another brand, even if its a bit more expensive, its worth the cost to get the real deal.",1
"I've been enjoying carrot juice for years -- home made in my juicer and also another well-known brand sold in the produce department, which is also good. But recently I purchased Lakewood brand and was so disturbed by the taste that I thought the bottle of juice had somehow gone bad. Thinking it was an isolated incident, I didn't say anything about it when my boyfriend bought two more 32 oz. bottles to use in a recipe we planned to make this morning (a wonderful ""pumpkin pie"" smoothie made with carrot juice, sweet potato and dates). We were making a large quantity, to serve to friends, and it turned out these bottles of juice were terrible too, so we had to scrap the whole plan. There is a real ""twangy"" almost metallic taste, bordering on rotten carrots. I don't know if it's the pasteurization process or what, but this brand of carrot juice does *not* taste like carrot juice. I would hate for people to buy it and think they don't like carrot juice due to how this tastes. I don't know what their process is, but the end result is very icky. (Sorry, Lakewood -- I really don't like giving bad reviews! But this stuff is not good!)",1
but not great (IMHO).  Not quite as strong / robust as I like my coffee.  I do like Tully's - French Roast in particular.  I have friends who like their coffee a little less robust so this will be good for their visits.,3
I absolutely love this coffee.  Great full bodied flavor with none of the acidity.,5
"Did not like this product.. My husband and I tried this for a week, 7 days,<br /><br />and we both had stomach problems, constipation, etc... We followe d the<br /><br />directions and tried it another 5 days and still had the same reaction,<br /><br />The other Bragg products work well and their books are amazing with<br /><br />insights into how you are eating,, but sadly, this product had the<br /><br />opposite effect.",2
"My family loves cinnamon-flavored cereals. Their favorite was one that was made by another company that has since stopped producing it. They were hoping to find something similar with these Mini-Wheats Little Bites, but found the same problems as they do with Kellogg's Cinnamon Toast Crunch - they don't hold their crisp for very long, and the taste just isn't as good as the other brand they loved so much. We'll keep searching.",3
Only order during the winter months.  they arive melted together when you order them during the summer.  When they are in good condition they are very good.,4
"i did some research on the maca root and debated many many times on whether it was worth the [...] bucks. i have tried the chia seeds from this company and totally loved them. So i figured it was a safe bet to buy this.<br /><br />The powder has a unique taste. it is slightly sweet and would take some getting used to. i add this to my steel cut oats in the am, but it can be used in smoothies, cookies, tea etc. i foresee this bag lasting me a very long time. i plan on making this a stable at my house.",4
"Not as strong as I would like but I can make it with less water. I did expect more from Folgers, but it is a nice alternative to some other K-cups out there.",3
"Poor value for the price.  $27.99 for six ounces?  That makes it almost $75 a pound for an ordinary and unexceptional product.  I've learned my lesson, never again!",1
Tried the new coffee by Martinsons because I needed something new. Every cup I tried seems to have a lot of coffee dust and sludge on the bottom the cup. I know that some of these k-cups do that but it seemed much more than usual. I think the filter is not filtering the coffee properly and allowing the finer grounds to get through.,1
"I was buying <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IYDXVE"">Enfamil Premium Lipil Single Serve Powder Packets 17.4 g Sticks, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, they will make 4oz of formula and are in packages just like sports drinks...HOWEVER the packaging SUCKS. Baby formula does not pour well and can get caught in the tinest of wrinkle and then come rushing out when it makes it way past. It's very light and fluffy so spills go everywhere. The single serve sticks are also larger, longer in length and can take up space in your diaper bag, you can't fold them up it's just awkward all around, especially to pour them in the car or at the mall, etc. Not to mention EXPENSIVE. Really EXPENSIVE, 8 packs for $12-$16. Meaning 8 bottles for that, when a whole formula case is $25. MAKE YOUR OWN SINGLE SERVE SOLUTIONS! I really can't express to you how awful the packaging is on these, they spill every single time, I'm no butterfingers so I know it's not me. The tear wrong, the formula comes gushing out after you try to coax it down when it gets stuck no matter how hard you try to flatten it out before you open. All in all, this is a great idea in theory, it just fails in design.<br /><br />Here are two cheaper and more efficient solutions:<br /><br /> Most moms have and use either the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RFCXIK"">Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser Combo Pack, Colors Vary</a> or a variant of it ( hear its not as good as this one and I believe it). We got a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006BAJIG"">Philips AVENT Formula BPA-Free Dispenser/Snack Cup</a>and I think it's excellent quality and wonderful, the dividers do not ""leak"" into each other at all since it's one piece mold, and you can just take it out if you want to use for snacks, it's a must have. That said, its so big in my diaper bag. I like to have as much room in my bag as I can, and every inch counts.<br /><br />So I got These plastic bags make it possible. Plus if I have sports powdered mixes, etc I can use these as well for myself.  Why not make your own single serve pouches? I looked into a few kinds and these <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EDINH8"">500 Poly Bag Clear Zipper Shipping Bags 3"" X 4""</a> were the best economically, (bags for cost) I can pack 3 or 4 bottles worth in the same space that a pack of altoids would take up, less actually. About 2 or 3 on top of each other is the thickness of my iphone 4. I can fit about 8 bags inside the avent formula dispenser. This is way better than the size more conventional formula dispensers hold. The best way to pour it into your cup or baby bottle ( from experience ) is to pinch it at the ziplock seam, open it so that the left corner is touching the right corner, and pour it out. Never spill a drop, no mess all over the place, love it.<br /><br />That said I would NEVER Give up the avent formula dispenser, I actually bought another because I love using them at home. I sit these out on the counter and I don't have to clutter up the kitchen, plus when a baby sitter comes over I just tell her pour one compartment into the bottle and shake. I also fill up bottles of water and have them waiting at the ready so I practically have to  nothing to make a bottle when I am tired or relying on others. These are a must have. If you don't want to fuss with the baggies, I would say this is the best compact formula dispenser for your money and on the market, hands down it sweeps the competition. Don't buy the cheaper ones, their dividers SUCK and the lid is iffy. This is the one that works best. Also, the best way to pout it out and get it all out quick and fast is to line up the hole with the bottle and SHAKE SIDE TO SIDE Rapidly. Back and forth, left to right, three or four times and it's all out! Don't worry, you wont spill and the formula wont get mixed up in the compartments.<br /><br />These options are the best value for your money. You have a new baby, you have PLENTY of other things to spend your money on, the list never ends babies suck you dry, so don't waste the money on these if you don't have to. Hope this helps.",2
"I bought this thinking it would be a good alternative to the regular soda I drink.  And I have to admit, when you first drink it it is OK.  It does have a weird aftertaste though, which bothers me the more i drink.  Maybe I will get used to it but I doubt it.<br /><br />I will certainly not be purchasing this product again.",2
The Stash brand teas pass with flying colors by every tea drinker in the office (all English or Russian). The English Breakfast and Earl Grey are their favorites.,5
"I ordered these flowers for my mother's birthday, 2/17, on 2/16 in the early afternoon Mountain time to be delivered the next day. I expected 24 red roses in a red vase to be delivered just like the picture leads one to believe.<br /><br />The flowers never arrived on the 17th. When I contacted Pro-Flowers, they advised me that they did not receive the order until 10:39AM 2/17 and do not do same day delivery but the flowers would be delivered the next day. Ok, I can understand this. A day late is not acceptable but I can deal with it. Amazon must have had technical issues.<br /><br />The flowers were delivered 2/18. There were only 12 with a white vase. Of the 12, 8 were tiny roses. Nothing at all like the picture which is displayed.<br /><br />I spoke with Christine and explained the issue. She apparently had computer issues but could give me no information beyond the fact they were delivered because she had computer issues. She tried to transfer me to a supervisor, where I held for over 20 minutes and finally tried calling back. Spoke with Babbette, who pulled up the order. When I asked when the order was placed, she also placed me on hold for a few minutes. She came back and when I explained that the situation was not acceptable, she placed me on hold again for 5 minutes. At this point, she offered to replace them; however, the gift that I purchased to bring joy and a smile became nothing more than a headache. She blamed Amazon's system and beyond the fact that only 12 were delivered, they delivered on time.<br /><br />I will pay the additional money next time and order from another company who can deliver on what they advertise.",1
"We have four smallish house type dogs that rule the roost here, so we thought we'd try this new bacon flavored Lickety Stik product on each of them. Reviews were mixed. A couple of them sniffed a lot, but didn't seem to want to partake. The other two licked gingerly, and would continue to do so as long as we squeezed the plastic bottle, but they didn't seem overly enthusiastic. It seemed to take a lot to squeeze the brown goo out onto the plastic head, actually, and it tended to drip off too much at times before they could lap it up. I think it also was bothersome that the plastic bottle looks a lot like a roller-ball underarm deodorant dispenser. Rather bizarre in a way. One of our sons is always teased about liking bacon so much, so at the latest family night supper he was asked if he wanted some Lickety Stick for his underarms. Everyone laughed. Except the dogs. They were trying to do a serious analysis and review. Anyway, maybe some dogs will like this stuff, but our family voted against buying more for our dogs. It was an interesting experiment, and your mileage may vary.",2

"I have a ten-ish (I think he was older then what the adoption place said he was) Chihuahua who I like to joke sleeps twenty-three hours a day, getting up to eat and go for bi-daily walks which he rarely has problems trotting along for except for when the temperature drops below freezing.  I also have a five year old poodle mix that is fairly active.  As directed, I sprinkled the recommended dosage (about a teaspoon each) on their dinners and both ate it up with no hesitation.  The powder has a nice cinnamon type smell to it.  Almost instantly I noticed both dogs have a bit more energy than usual post dinner, roaming around and engaging me in a game of tug before their nightly naps.  In all, I used up one can in about a month and a half using it daily at dinner for both my dogs.",4

"I did a long search for bio degradable bags and settled on these.  They are fine until the seam at the bottom slips apart.  Granted this only happened probably 3 times in the box, but that's three times too many.  Wet poop falling straight out on to the side walk is an unpleasant, difficult job to clean up.  Not being able to trust the bag makes for a tedious hold after use for the remainder of the walk.  Disappointed.  Find a better adhesive for the seam and it would be all good!",2
"My hair dresser's salon bought a Keurig Machine, so I have been able to sample a variety of K-Cups. K-cups are about 10 times more expensive than a regularly brewed cup of coffee so I have never considered buying one for myself, but having a Keurig Machine at a hair salon makes sense! People have a variety of tastes and K-Cups can provide a nice variety and freshly made one at that.<br /><br />The salon has a nice variety of K-cups: Folders, Wolfgang Puck, Timothy's, and Green Mountain (that owns Keurig).<br /><br />Everyone's taste vary, but here is my assessment of the ones that I have tried so far. Wolfgang Puck was my second favorite. So far, I like Folgers the best.<br /><br />FOLGERS GOURMET<br />SELECTIONS LIVELY COLOMBIAN<br />Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 36 for $25)<br />Earthy flavor, fruity and nutty flavors come through.<br /><br />WOLFGANG PUCK CHEFS RESERVE COLOMBIAN DARK ROAST<br />Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 48 for $32.98)<br />A dark roast with caramel and earthy notes, slight burnt<br />and papery flavors.<br /><br />TIMOTHY'S DECAFFEINATED COLOMBIAN MEDIUM<br />Price per cup: 60 cents (package of 50 for $30)<br />A bit on the weak side, kind of papery, and less astringent than the others.<br /><br />Ali Julia review",3
"I have three older cats who take arthritis pills.  One also takes a thyroid pill.  I decided to try the pill pockets.  For the first month or so, they all loved them, and they made it easy to give the pills.  However, after three months:<br /><br />One cat still loves them.  I have to watch her carefully or she will steal the pills from the others.<br /><br />One cat has figured out how to eat around the pill.<br /><br />One cat sometimes takes them, but at other times just sniffs the pocket and skips it.<br /><br />I have figured out a few tricks that help:<br /><br />There are two types of pockets for cats:  chicken and salmon.  The chicken is slightly larger and more pliable and works better with larger pills.  However, I think that the cats find the salmon tastier.<br /><br />Get another cat treat and stick it to the side of the pill pocket.  Then place the pocket so the treat faces down.  My finicky cat is much more likely to eat the whole thing that way.<br /><br />The pill pocket still helps with the cat who eats around it.  After she eats the pill pocket, it is easier to shove the pill down her throat.  She is more likely to swallow it instead of spitting it out if it tastes of pill pocket.<br /><br />If you have two pills, try to fit them both in one pocket.  Giving the cat fewer pockets will make it seem more of a treat.",3

"I ordered the chocolate hemp shake hoping that it would be easier to drink (or for that matter, to keep down) than the bulk protein powder, but I was not impressed. The only liquid I seem to be able to get this to mix into without having large lumpy chunks was coffee-hot coffee. I'm not sure what the high temperature does to the protein, so this left me a little frustrated. If you want hemp protein I would actually suggest just buying the bulk protein and dealing with the bad taste.",2

I think there was maybe one teeny Bing cherry hiding in the first bag I opened. Then I looked into the other two bags for something cherrylike. Nope. Nothing. Very disappointed in that. The flavor is also rather bland, without a noticeable vanilla kick. Maybe it's a bum batch, but I'll not be purchasing this flavor again. I will stick with the fantastic Nature's Harvest granola varieties, also lower in calories and fat than many granola products out there and with a generous inclusion of fruit and nuts.",2
"These are pretty cheap, so we weren't sure what we were going to get. I feel like these are pretty weak, they are alot like the gas station cappuccinos out of the machine but not as strong. I do like that it is only 80 calories, so it's nice to have as a low calorie treat when dieting.",2
"A number of us earnestly tried this product but after trying another brand, found this to be wanting very much.<br /><br />  With that said, there is a company making soy jerky that has better flavor, texture and quality. They even make jerky that is unsweetened. Most importantly, this company tasty eats does not have any garlic or onion powder in any of their products.<br /><br />  This was the biggest, we felt, downfall of this product. Except this company, every jerky company; except tasty eats which uses no garlic or onion powder in any of their product line, all would list garlic or onion if an ingredient. The primal strips company has ""vegetarian spices"" so one is not clear what this is. Even the company, after phoning them, are rather reticent about saying if their is granulated garlic or onion. But there is. In these primals strips, all are having some form of garlic, possibly onion.<br /><br />  We found tasty eats soy jerky to be Perfect. Really, in quality, texture and also the fact that they use no onion or garlic whatsoever.",1
"Oatmeal Squares is in about the largest print you can fit on the Box.  When you read the ingredients, the second largest ingredient is WHEAT flour. So how can it rightfully be called a ""Crunchy Oat Cereal"".<br /><br />I wonder why Quaker which is noted for Oatmeal has to be somewhat deceptive and not disclose upfront that this is not completely an Oat Cereal and then go on to make claims about Cholesterol Lowering when it is not ALL Oat Flour.<br /><br />Oatmeal is made from oats not wheat.",2
"This is an odd ""cookie"" (on the front of the package these are labelled as ""crispy cookies"") because it has very little flavor. The variety I tried was the Fig & Honey flavor and I had the hardest time trying to figure out what I was tasting because the flavor is so mild. After trying a few I picked up the hint of sweetness (honey) and some cinnamon (the last ingredient is listed as ""natural flavor (contains cinnamon)"". The taste was no great, not bad....just ok. Not really a fig flavor like traditional fig newtons. Crispier texture. The package says a serving is 3 cookies which has 140 calories, 5g of fat, 0 cholesterol. 95mg sodium. A very underwhelming snack.",2
I was disappointed because I didn't pay attention to the quantity of the coffee.  I feel it's way overpriced for the very little coffee you get.  Two ounces of coffee for $8 is not a fair price.,2
"My little Lhasa loved these, but she threw up big balls of starch.

Small dogs don't have the digestive track needed to process these.  They will be switching from the existing potato formula to a more digestible Tapioca line.<br /><br />I need to hand it to Zuke's though. I told them about the product, and they rushed to send me samples and refund my money.",1
Very delicious and the ingredients are probably very close to what our ancestors had access too but I still worry about the amount of sugars in such a small serving size. Definitely healthier than your typical Chips-ahoy  but I feel the sugar content is too high for a low carb dieter.,4

"I drink my coffee strong.  The 3 ounce sample I received of this product wasn't nearly enough quantity for me to give it a real taste test, as I use twice that amount of coffee to make my morning brew.  Keep that in mind if you also drink your coffee strong: the 3 ounce packets are small.<br /><br />I am a Folgers fan.  It has a full-bodied flavor that is rich and satisfying to me.  So I am comparing Puroast Low Acid Coffee to Folgers, and the Puroast Low Acid Coffee failed miserably.  I found Puroast coffee thin and weak with some bitterness.  There is a mild espresso flavor that is similar to Turkish coffee I have had.  Bitter and unpleasant, but weak at the same time.<br /><br />I have had acid reflux (GERD) in the past and drinking regular coffee does exacerbate the condition.  This low acid coffee is made for people with acid reflux conditions so severe that they have had to stop drinking their morning coffee, and I applaud the fact that any coffee company has addressed the issue.  At the same time, the price is prohibitive.  10 tiny 3 ounce bags for $24?  If you make one pot every morning, that $72 a month!  For that cost, I would suggest buying acid reducer pills, and taking one before you drink your morning coffee, and to try to eat something bland while drinking your coffee, to give your stomach something to do with all the acid it is creating.<br /><br />Or, if you only have acid reflux in the morning and you think it's the coffee you are drinking, be aware that it could be caused by some medications you are taking, like calcium or vitamin pills.  In fact, any large pill can sit in your stomach and cause your stomach to create a lot of acid trying to break it down.  A recommendation is to either take more frequent smaller doses of the vitamin supplement, or stop them all together and cut out the acid reflux entirely.  Or add acid reducer medication and put up with it.<br /><br />Two or three sips of this Puroast Low Acid Coffee and it's down the drain.  It's giving me acid reflux just talking about it.",3

"I was really disappointed in this product. First of all the net weight is 4.25 oz, not 6 oz. It's about 1/3 water. Secondly the pieces are small and crumbled, without the taste or texture of crab. It could have been good quality white tuna I was eating. The taste is watery and washed out. If you're looking for succulent large pieces of crab meat this ain't it. Whatever taste is there gets lost, even in a green salad. In a crabmeat salad with mayo this would disappear all together. Might as well just use tuna already!",1
"I was very excited to try these bags given the great reviews that they had. They're biodegradable, have reinforced seams, and each package has an inspection tag that comes out, making me feel like their quality should be good. But now that I've been through more than 1 package of them, I conclude that I prefer the Lansinoh bags.<br /><br />(1) These bags are perforated on three sides at the top. Initially, I thought this would be a good thing, but it takes two hands and some mental focus to get them open. This annoys me.<br /><br />(2) Once the perforated parts have been removed, they still don't open as easily, and the top part is much larger. Both of these things make it more difficult to pour milk into them and increase the risk of spillage (for me).<br /><br />(3) Every brand of breast milk bag I've had has a few that leaked during thawing, but these were the first bags I have ever used that leaked immediately  - with  no freezing involved. I was pouring milk in to the bag, and the bag was pouring it out onto my desk. I think you failed, Inspection #1310712-A.",2
Not sure how it works as far as giving you energy because I could not ingest it due to the taste of the green apple flavor.,2
"Supposedly increases milk production? Yeah, I didn't see a difference after drinking this for a good 3+ weeks. Aside from that, it doesn't smell or taste very good. Very herbal medicine-like.",2
"Product arrived 3/12/2012. Item is marked 3/10/2012 with what I can only assume is the expiration date. Product not intended for U.S. as it has Arabic, Greek and Chinese lettering. There is some English but its a bit hidden. Not that the text needs to be English but combining this with the expiration leads me to believe the candy isn't intended for U.S. market. Is there a law against that, selling expired goods imported from another country? This product was packaged by Amazon LLC.<br /><br />I don't want to hurt the product itself with a low rating. Its probably good stuff, but I'll never know because Amazon sold me expired goods.",3
"I drink this tea because I love the taste and now, I still enjoy it, even though I was informed that it has some medicinal value, as well.",5
i like drinking this tea.  i add some extra lemon grass<br /><br />i would think of this as a nice decaf green tea with some other herbs; you wont be able to feel difference in your joints,4
"Sometimes, Amazon.com reviews lie, and they lie big time, but that's just me.<br /><br />During a recent trip to Whole Foods, a product in the freezer case piqued my interest: Artic Zero Chocolate Peanut Butter All Natural Frozen Dessert. At 32 calories for a half-cup, I was jazzed. After all, you can't even find sorbet that is that low calorie and is gluten-free and natural. I mean, 150 calories for the entire pint? I might as well eat the entire thing, and maybe that's what my plan was in purchasing it.<br /><br />So, over Shabbat last week, Tuvia and I cracked the pint open, and scooped out larger-than-1/2-cup portions and dug in ... to disappointment. Tuvia originally said that it was ""bland"" and mostly flavorless. I said it tasted like nothing but creamy peanut butter, straight out of the jar, which is my least favorite thing on the planet (I'm a crunchy kind of girl). And the chocolate? Non-existent.<br /><br />Eighty-five Amazon.com reviewers gave the product 4 out of 5 stars, which, let's be honest, shocks me. This stuff isn't worth it. A few bites in, we were both disappointed and uninterested. We chucked the rest of the pint and probably won't venture down the Arctic Zero road again -- even for a quick sweet-tooth craving.<br /><br />Bummer.",1
I really did not like this tea. i general love chamomile tea and drink a lot of different brands  but this one has a strong honey flavor that totally overpowers chamomile.,2
"My first impression: pears mixed with green beans????? Strange.  My second impression: convenient packaging? It was not more convenient than a jar in my opinion.<br />I tasted this first and was surprised that I did not gag--I can't stand most baby foods.  It really wasn't a terrible combination and the pear taste was a little stronger than the bean without being overwhelming.  As far as taste, the most important factor (the baby), reallyenjoyed the food.<br />I don't believe that having ""organic"" plastered all over the product should make the consumer feel safe.  The design of the product didn't bowl me over either and packaging in not biodegradeable.  I don't find this package any more convenient than traditional jars--and jars can be recycled.  In fact, once a baby is eating more (finishes a jar), the jar is more convenient since the baby can be fed directly from the jar.  IF hot water is available, a jar can be placed in it as easily as the pouch in order to warm the food.",3
"My dog had been taking pills without issue for several months.  Due to a recent surgery, her daily pill count has gone up dramatically, and it has become increasingly difficult to get her to take them. I have heard many people saying how wonderfully these pill pockets work, so I finally decided to give them a try.  First, I think they are ridiculously expensive (although reasonable at Amazon, these cost almost 30% more at my local pet store, where I unfortunately bought them).  Second, if the pills taste bad (particularly if they are tablets that are cut in half to lower the dosage), it is likely that your dogs will still spit them out if they are anything like mine.  I was hoping for the magic solution to pill taking, but this is not it.",2
The Green Mountain Nantucket Blend K-Cup portion pack for Keurig is a great coffee and everything is fresh and packaged nicely.,5
Economical way to purchase a cold brew tea that has natural flavoring. Easy to make and tastes great. No guilt with this drink.,4
"The product seems to be alright (I have not yet used it. Have it stored in the fridge until I'm ready).  However, I notice that there is no shelf life date on the package and there is no advice as to how I should store the item BEFORE I use it.  It does recommend refrigeration AFTER I open the package.  I would appreciate having had this information prior to purchase.",4
"This is the original recipe Dr. Pepper. It is made with 100% pure cane sugar; none of the high-fructose corn syrup the soft-drink industry has been shoving down our throats for years. This means even people with corn allergies can enjoy Dr.Pepper. Unfortunately, after October 2012, manufacturing of original recipe Dr. Pepper will be forced to cease. Apparently Snapple purchased Dr. Pepper and will no longer allow the production of the original recipe.<br />Original recipe Dr. Pepper tastes great. It has the same calorie count and caffeine content as the ""standard"" Dr. Pepper.<br />I wonder if a petition would sway Snapple's decision?<br />While it is still available, it is a very good price, but shipping is a bit outrageous. (However, considering 24 cans weighs about 20 pounds, I can understand.)<br />I suggest you buy original recipe Dr. Pepper while you still can and perhaps send off a note to Snapple requesting they permit Dr. Pepper original recipe to co-exist with ""standard"" Dr. Pepper.",5
"I am an occasional fan of grapefruit, whether it be the fruit or the juice, and I found that this was a bit too tart for my tastes. Granted, grapefruit itself is tart and so the flavor makes sense but when I had every flavor of the Sparkling ICE line in my fridge, I found myself always reaching for one of the others (especially the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P00PGQ"">Sparkling ICE Mountain  Spring Water, Pomegranate Berry, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a> and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006FUL4AE"">TalkingRain Sparkling ICE Lemonade, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>) instead.<br /><br />If you really enjoy grapefruit than I think that you will love this. It's just mild enough to mix well with the carbonation and like all of the Sparkling ICE line, it's calorie free so you can't go wrong with that.<br /><br />If you occasionally drink grapefruit juice but find it too tart sometimes, I'm not sure buying a 12 pack right away would be the best bet. I would try to find it in a local store first and buy just one to try as this is very dependent on personal tastes.<br /><br />Again, the ONLY reason this is rated four stars instead of five is simply due to personal taste. This is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone as long as they enjoy grapefruit :)",4
"If drink disaster has a taste, this is it. BB pina colada mix was so bad, I thought it was expired. Using Splenda is a bad idea, Bob. If you read these reviews, sCRAP this recipe and if you gotta go sugarless, try stevia, much smoother...",1
"This juice tastes great, and even my picky two year old loves it. It is very sweet so its perfect for those moms like myself who like to limit sugar (even natural kind) intake and delute down juices with water.",5
"The flavor of this coffee is average, in my opinion.  Tastes vary from person to person, and I am not partial to any one brand, I just didn't find this particular coffee to have any stand-out aspects.  It tasted fine, and I have no complaints.<br /><br />I will say, I did not find myself shaking from a caffeine let-down later after drinking it, so thankfully it's not as heavy on the caffeine as some coffees I've tried.<br /><br />I realize these pods are for a specific kind of machine, but I wanted to brew some coffee like tea with boiling water while on our camping trip.  Unlike other reviewers, I did not have any trouble with making a single serving mug - I simple pressed on the pod several times during brewing with the back of a spoon as it steeped in the mug with the water.  I had rich, dark coffee with very little fuss.",3
"I'm eating a cup of this soup as I type this. It's handy to have in the office, it keeps me from running out to buy something deep-fried or cream-filled, and it really isn't bad. But it's not my favorite Dr. McDougall's soup. It has a slightly bitter edge that I don't care for, the kind you sometimes get from dried herbs that have been sitting too long (the use-by date is a year from now), and at the same time it seems too sweet. The first thing my wife said about it when she tried hers a few minutes ago was, ""too sweet,"" so it's not just me (and she likes food sweeter than I do). We won't throw the rest of the box away, but I won't be ordering this one again. If I'm going to give up a trip to my favorite bakery to eat soup in my office, I want it to be better than not bad.",3
"Thank you for the fast delivery of my order, the 6lb bag of Midnight Blue popcorn. It popped on the stovetop just fine, although I think this company also sells a popper, which we haven't purchased. We will enjoy this tasty snack for a long time to come, and have plenty to share with a few friends and family.",4
"Tasty Bite has become my least favorite brand of shelf-stable retort-packaged Indian meals. The Bombay Potatoes are a pleasant surprise after some of the other meals such as the syrupy Thai entrees.  (The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5DKLM"">Tasty Bite Entree, Punjab Eggplant, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> is another one I like.)<br /><br />The potatoes and chickpeas have retained a sufficient amount of texture.  The sauce is thin but has a pleasant spiciness and there is plenty of it, which I don't mind because it is pretty good, especially compared to some of the other ones I have tried.  You can add leftover potato, chickpeas, or even green beans to this meal and I like to serve it with brown rice and garnish with diced chili peppers.<br /><br />The entire package is supposed to be two servings but is realistically one. The total contents have 820mg of sodium, 6g of dietary fiber, 8g of fat, and 1g of saturated fat. The meal is vegan and is certified kosher.",4

This is unlike any other k cups I have tried.  It is extremely weak tasting and only half of the actual cup is filled with ground coffee.  It tastes like instant coffee.  Im gald I got this super cheap.  I will not be buying it again.,1
I'm so glad that I only bought one bottle!  What was this company thinking?  Didn't anyone taste this stuff before bottling it?  Oh my gosh...I took a big gulp (expecting something delicious and refreshing) and just about spit it out!  This form of stevia is so bitter :-(  Don't waste your money!,1
"These are tasty and very satisfying food bars; I keep them on hand for when I'm out and about.  I have them shipped by Amazon's auto-ship to save extra cash.  They are very good to have when it's time to eat but you have no time to get something good for you.  These are also great for anyone on a raw food diet, and/or vegan.  But they are tasty for anyone that can eat fruit and nuts!<br /><br />Our favorites are any of the chocolate varieties, but this one's good too!",4

The taste of this item was very unpleasant.  If you want something good try the Ritz 100 calorie salty and sweet snack kettle mix, absolutely delicious. These 2 items look similar but when it comes to taste they are extreme opposites.  One is awful and the other is delicious.",2
A little less than I expected.  It tends to have a muddy taste - not what I expected since they said it was the favorite of the company.,3
"Started out OK, but after a few weeks my dog decided she didn't like the taste all that much, became picky and wouldn't finish her feedings. I ended up discarding a half-bag and switching to Wellness brand Puppy mix. Canidae does produce very dense, dark stools so if you have to pick up poop this makes it easy. With a 1-acre fenced yard I don't bother.",2
"This was a good sample of different types of pods, although I am not sure I can tell them apart in a blind tasting.  There are definitely differences in the brands - I do like some better than others, but overall are all pretty good.",4
"I bought this product because of the ingredients . No grain , thinking this would be healthier for my multiple cats . Unfortunetly , I cannot write a review because none of the cats would eat it . This is also true of the turkey and salmon flavor I purchased at the same time . Guess they just don't have a yen for a higher end cat food ! Sorry",1
"I love Salt & Vinegar chips and once I went on my diet I felt like I had to give them up because it's so hard to find healthy ones.  Then I finally found these and I love them!  They're strong tasting and I actually like them better than regular salt & vinegar chips.  They're less oily and I don't feel sick or guilty after having some.  The one-ounce bags are perfect for a snack, but the 3.25 ounce bags end up being cheaper so I divide it up into 3 ziplock bags once I open them.  It works great!",5
this is exactyl what i have been searching for for over a year.  it was availabe for a while in my local grocery store and was discontinued.  the item arrived in a very timely fashion.,4
"the smell of spices from this tea is awesome, but the tea itself is weak, if you try to let it soak in the cup for extra seconds it will leave bitter taste,I tried to  add a packet of lipton tea but the taste still bitter, so<br />I'm still practicing with it, it also didn't work with half&half, not much with coffee mate. nothing like the original or made from scratch.<br /> MY RECOMMENDATIONS: since it is huge quantity that you can't return, try one package from the store first and see if it works for you.",3
"I tried this coffee with a bit of trepidation. I'm not a fan of hazelnut. I've always found the flavor to be a bit overwhelming which is odd because I really like hazelnuts. Not so here. This was a very tasty hazelnut. The smell was subtle and not at all over-powering. The flavor was nice, nutty without getting into oily & nasty. The coffee in the package is a nice dark color. It's very finely ground so should work well in capacino machines. It brewed up very nicely in our french press and our drip coffee machine. I really enjoyed the experience.<br /><br />The bag on the other hand, I struggled for quite a while to get it open and finally just had to cut the top off. Which made it more than bit difficult to use for later storage. I understand that to retain the freshness, sealing the bag is very important, but in order for me to consume the product, opening the bag is equally important. And since I may be under the assumption that I can continue to store the coffe in the bag, like other brands, making it so I have to partially destroy the bag in order to open it seems slightly counter-intuitive.<br /><br />Anyway, great coffee, not so great packaging. If you get it, make plans for alternate storage.",4
This tea tastes more like spiced tea rather than coconut.  Try CS vanilla maple if you crave an excellent tea.,2
FOUND A RECIPE THAT CALLED FOR THIS SEA SALT.  IT HAS A UNIQUE FLAVOR THAT WORKS WELL WITH MANY DIFFERENT FOODS.  I LOVE IT!  COMES IN A VARIETY OF COLORS DEPENDING ON THE MINERAL WITH THE SALT.<br />SHIPPED PROMPTLY.,5
"I bought some of this and tried several packets. I wanted to like it, I really did. But like all of the aspartame-based sweeteners like Equal and Nutra-sweet, stevia is bitter.  Truvia gets 2 stars because it is markedly less bitter than the others but still not sweet like sugar. The rest of the fake sugars get no stars and some are so bad as to owe stars back, like negative stars.<br /><br />I am probably very sensitive to it but so are many others. So if you find artificial sweeteners bitter, then Truvia will be bitter as well. But splitting it with sugar helps somewhat. The only thing that tastes like cane sugar is cane sugar - or beet sugar or whatever but a non-artificial sweetener.",2
Well the creme caramel was on sale so I decided to give it a shot. Plus the fact that each K Cup is individually prepared by Mr. Puck himself. Anyway I quite enjoy these. I never buy flavored ones so overall I'm happy with these but they are definitely not my favorite as I usually buy the bolder ones and these are fairly mild.,3
Would rather have more coffee instead of mugs.<br /><br />I like the variety and the 12 oz bags are perfect for my home roaster.,4
"It's not just THIS Walden Farms product, but every one I've tried. Syrups, marshmallow dip, Ketchup, Cocktail sauce.....!! You'd think after wasting so much money on them (not to mention the taste that leaves your mouth feeling like a chemical sewer!) I'd learn but kept hoping ONE item would be salvageable. No. They are so bad I almost considered gargling with bleach to erase the taste. There are no words for what these Walden products taste like: not any that can be printed on Amazon, at any rate. (shudder)",1
"I added MIO Liquid Enhancer to a 16.9 ounce of bottled water and took a sip, my first impression.  Smelled like peach.  Tasted like peach.  Instructions on bottle say each squeeze adds more flavor, one squeeze for each 8 ounces. So what is a squeeze?  Each person's squeeze is different.  I thought it might be a measured squeeze, so I squeezed it. Well I guess that was too much, it definitely was too sweet with over powering peachiness and left an unpleasant aftertaste that stayed in my mouth for a short time.<br /><br />I gave MIO Liquid a second try with a 16.9 ounce bottle of water and two small squeezes of MIO.  I sipped it. This time there was not enough peach flavor and there still was an aftertaste that stayed in my mouth.<br /><br />This product leaves a lot up to a person's personal taste and squeeze.  Each time I used it the results were different because each time a slightly different amount was added to the bottled water.  And even then it is still not a perfect flavor or taste.  Perhaps if it was premeasured, a chamber at the top that would fill when turned upside down with a measured amount would allow each drink to be more consistent.  Even so, this would not improve the aftertaste, Lipton and Crystal Light taste much better.  I will not be purchasing this product and can only give it one star.",1
"Most snacks have the unfortunate circumstance of being great tasting and bad for you, or good for the soul and bad for the palette. These almonds are a win on both ends.  Don't expect something salty or sweet.  They're shelled and oven roasted, just the pure test of almonds with their delicious oils heightened through the roasting process.  Definitely my 'go to' at work!",4
Our 6 month old loved it and it helped him poop!  The value is good on Amazon and it seemed to have a flavor that our picky baby liked.,4
"I do like the taste of these bars, however, do plan to get sticky when eating.  These stick to the plastic pouch and are difficult to get out, especially if you eat them while bike riding, running or working out.  You end up with a mess on your hands.  Refrigerating before eating may help, but may also lead to tooth loss.  These are my thoughts!",3
I will never understand why they put Splenda into non-diet drinks but I can tell you that it was a horrible idea. So diet is undrinkable and so is regular. It tastes sooo awful. Maybe they'll get with the program and fire the fool that thought people would want to buy crap in a bottle.,2
"Wow! For some reason I feel like I'm really getting a special treat when I open one of these lollypops, which stand out from the mass-produced candy found at most grocery stores. The Pomegranate Pucker is my favorite out of all the different flavors YummyEarth makes, followed by the Grape and then Cherry, so I just buy the single-flavor bags now instead of slogging through the flavors I'm not as interested in. What I like best about the Pomegranate flavor is that it's sweet and tart, but it's not so acidic that you start to worry about burning a hole in your tongue. I also really like that when the pops wear down, they don't become super sharp and cut my tongue. If you're a fan of pomegranates and like candy like Jolly Ranchers, prepare to be amazed by this set!",5
the jerky was so tough i was only able to eat 1 out of ever 3 pieces. was a complete was of money. i'm very disappointed in the product. the only positive is that it is low sodium (either by make or by the fact that only a few pieces are edible),1

"The product is very good. Best oatmeal around. This vendor is NOT. I've tried to get a response from them about the shipping and they have ignored 4 attempts. I paid for expedited shipping, which was more than the oatmeal, or the same and it arrived about 10-14 days later. They shipped it ground and took my money for 2 day shipping. All I wanted was the difference of ground/2nd day reimbursed to my account. I'll go to Ireland before I order from them again.",2
I love the assorted K-Cups!!  It is a great way to try out different flavors without having to buy a box of one flavor not knowing if you will like it.,5
"I was a big fan of these when last I bought them...<br />The new and improved flavor is no improvement at all.<br />It starts off ok, but you soon realize that any sweetness that the mints had is gone.<br />Very disappointing. They're not the same at all. :(",1
"So you want some tasty flavorful potato chips, seriously why bother with these. Please understand they are baked. Even so, they taste like seasoned cardboard. Ur better off with a rice cake. Or how about you walk around the block and then enjoy a handful of the standard kettle chips, well worth it!<br /><br />This product Skip!",1
"I found this to be the best bargain for a higher quality dog food, comparable to Wellness and Blue Buffalo. My dogs both love it and one of my dogs that often gets topical yeast infections does not have problems on this food so its not full of bread filler. The only other food comparable for my dog's yeast problem is Wellness and it got too pricy for me.  I did notice a salmonella recall on the Diamond lamb flavor, spring of 2012, so I keep an alert on my google news,  but its the only recall I've seen and it went public fast, right on the Diamond site and there were no fatalities because it was dealt with well.

"This doesn't need to be a long review. I was intrigued by the concept of this mixer, especially since I love natural peanut butter but hate the stirring.

"For the informed thinker consumer...<br /><br />WHAT!!<br /><br />When you understand what the buzz words mean, you become an educated and informed consumer capable of making a good choice for your pet and your money pouch. So many of my friends' dogs are sick with cancer and other diseases. Whay are they eatting...? I made the choice will you; or do you like to have your ears tickled?<br /><br />The Painful Truth:<br /><br />You really do get what you pay for when it comes to pet food, as illustrated in Ann N. Martin's book, Food Pets Die For. First published in 1997 and updated in 2003, Martin's book was the first to expose the ingredients legally used by pet food companies, including euthanized cats and dogs, zoo animals, roadkill, and diseased and rotted meat unfit for human consumption. Lest you think that what Martin documented isn't widespread, she writes:<br /><br />""In later investigations in both the US and Canada, I was to learn that the collars, tags, flea collars, and even plastic bags in which (euthanized) pets are wrapped, are not removed before they are shoved in the rendering pit. Deceased pets are being 'recycled' into pet food, and pet owners have no knowledge of what is happening.""<br /><br />* Poultry by-product meal. By-products can include: intestines, chicken heads, duck bills, chicken and turkey feet, feathers and bone, soy, cottonseed hulls, corn cobs, peanut hulls, citrus pulp, screenings, weeds, straw, and cereal by-products. Ingredients listed as beef, chicken and poultry by-products are not required to include actual meat. Rendered meat can be ANY rendered mammal meat, including cats and dogs. If the ingredient contained enough meat that it could be measured, it would be labeled as MEAT.<br />* Digest of chicken by-products. Animal digest is a cooked-down broth made from unspecified parts of unspecified animals. Any kind of animal can be included, and the animals can be obtained from any source, so there is no control over quality or contamination.<br />* Corn gluten meal. Corn gluten is a cheap by-product of human food processing. It offers little nutritional value and serves mainly to bind food together.<br />* Soybean meal. Soybean meal is a poor quality protein filler. The Crude Protein analysis on pet food labels is only a measurement of the amount of nitrogen in a food -- not the quality of the protein. Because of this, pet food companies can use the cheaper by-products of human food production, such as soybean meal, to boost protein numbers.",1
"Well I have tried many protein shakes and the taste is never been a problem for me but this was just horrible. It's GOOD for YOU but I just couldn't do it. It might be a good protein shake but it's extremely salty, i tried to drink it with other liquids to help the taste but every time it tasted worse and worse =( too bad because I was looking forwards to see some results!!",2
I am very disappointed. I did not receive any sleepy time tea yet they sent me African Rooibos. I don't even like African Rooibos.

"The hot chocolate has a great taste. I purchased it because my sister was worried about the kids having too much sugar every night before bed. The kids had no idea it was sugar free. Even the adults we gave it to had no clue. Like other reviewers said - it doesn't mix very well so we actually made it on the stove in a pot so it would have time to mix up. If you were looking to make one packet with just some hot water, stir it a lot and even then you will have some chocolate not melted. On a positive note, each packet does make a decent size cup of hot chocolate. Enjoy!",4

My hair is long and easily tangled. One thing I especially want in a conditioner is a product that will let me effortlessly comb through my hair after shampooing and conditioning. This product was not quite as good as Pantene in this area. My hair also seemed to frizz more than with Pantene.<br /><br />The conditioner is thick and has a nice scent. It is especially designed for itchy scalps which is not something I suffer from. People with that condition might find this product more useful than I did.,3
"Depending on your taste for spiciness, these rate somewhere around slight-eyewatering.  Though after a while, I think your tongue just gives up on the ""Hey, this is spicy!"" message.  The Teriyaki flavor is mild and doesn't overpower the nice seaweed taste.  These sheets are really crunchy right out of the bottle.  I've noticed after a few days, the crunchiness decreases, due to humidity I guess.  Though usually I just pull a few sheets out, and put the lid right back on.... Anyway, I like them best when at tiptop crunch-factor.  Sheets are approximately 1.5"" by 3.5"".",5
"I do all the research before buying pet food.  I had high hopes that this one would work with out kibble eating cats as one of them needed to eat food containing more moisture as well as healthy ingredients.  When I opened the first can it smelled and looked good.  I was confident our cats would scarf it up and beg for more.  No way.  They made dainty little burying movements and then walked away.  All I could think of was how much I had spent for such puny results.  Now we are back to using the top grade of kibble and Fancy Feast, which our cats will eat.  However, the good news is that everyone we gave some to from the first case reported back that their cats loved it and they were going to keep using it.  Fancy Feast is cheaper so that is good, but I have no idea what is in the product.  I just trust that our cats are getting enough moisture.  I do regret that we are not using  Newman's Own product since I like their philosophy.",3
"I didn't care for this particular Lavazza coffee at all.<br />It's very one-dimensional and has no aroma whatsoever.<br />Even though it's a darker roast, and I prefer a darker flavor,<br />this one just tastes acidic and ""muddy"" to me.<br />I like Lavazza Oro better. Oro is definitely much lighter, but at least it<br />has aroma and depth.",2
"This coffee maker is just ok.  My husband wanted it so we got it but it's not that great. It has good features, but when it comes down to the coffee, it doesn't make a full cup and it's not very hot and it's really loud. I don't think it was worth the money but my husband loves it. Now we have two coffee makers on the counter.",3
"I loved the product, however the flavors listed were not the ones in the package. There were no Razzmatazz Berry, or Orange Squeeze in the package. either the item should be relabeled with the correct flavors or better packaging needs to happen.",3
"You can only say so much about a breadstick. These are really good ,chunchy and taste great. loved em and am about to order some more.",4
"Dark roast is its own league...the amino profiles of the beans change considerably.  But with that said, I've had high altitude dark roasts that were much better.  In fact, this coffee STINKS when you open the bag and sniff the beans.  I ground it coarsely and used a french press...poured in about 20 seconds...and guess what...it still doesn't smell good.  Drinking it black, it's smooth, not bitter, but flat on the palette.  I don't understand all the rave reviews...this coffee sucks.  I'd rather drink pre-ground maxwell house that's been sitting around for 30 minutes (yuck).  Maybe you can cook with it (in caramel since its not bitter, maybe) but I wouldn't bother drinking it...it sucks.  There is considerable crema and oil...but the taste is flat.  I also ordered Lavazza (Tierra) for moka ""espresso"" but it brews up better than almost every other bean I've tried.  Also Cameron's Organic ""toasted southern pecan"" coffee really surprised me (I don't like flavored coffees)...I love it.  Save your $$ and avoid these beans...get a brazilian dark roast instead...",2
"I drink a lot of Crystal Light and generally enjoy the fruity flavors.  The Crystal Light Mocktails Mojito mix does not bring me enjoyment.  This mojito mix is disgusting and after drinking a single half-glass, I'm dumping the entire pitcher and throwing out the rest of the package.  Yes, it's that bad.  The synthetic ""mint"" flavor hits hard and continues to punish long after you've swallowed.  Yuck yuck yuck!<br /><br />My wife wasn't quite as offended but she agreed that it was not good and had no issue with me discarding the product.",1
"I gave this product poor reviews because they do not allow returns and yet my product arrived damaged. The shipping box itself was in great condition, but the item must have been damaged before shipping.  One corner was badly smashed in. Who did the quality control here?  I'm embarrassed to give this as a gift for the holidays as is.",1
"I have two dogs and one tends to chomp down whatever she gets and the other one tends to sniff it out first before chowing down. I got the medium sized Crunch 'n Clean and the dogs I have are a border collie mix and a black lab mix.<br /><br />Amber, my black lab mix, took to the treat instantly, eating it very quickly. As for Palmer, my border collie mix, it took him a little while before he was ready to try the treat. However, after his initial taste, he would grab the treat whenever he is offered it.<br /><br />The size of the treats are pretty good for medium dogs. It takes more than a few bites before they can swallow the biscuits completely so make sure to monitor them when they are eating this. Amber tends to swallow really fast without chewing so I can see these as potentially a choke hazard for any dogs who do not like to chew. Therefore, make sure to watch the dogs as they are eating these treats.",4
"I followed the directions  and hung this in my garage. I left it up for 2 to 3 weeks and all I caught was 1 fly. AND YES I saw a tons of flies flying around it through the weeks, but they took no interest. All it did was smell up my garage. Don't waste your $$.",1
"I LOOKED FORWARD TO RECIEVING THIS PRODUCT AND WHEN IT CAME I EAGERLY OPENED A CAN TO TASTE THE PRODUCT.  I FOUND THAT THE FISH WAS BROKEN INTO SMALL PIECES AND I DIDN'T LIKE THE TASTE OF THE ""TOMATO SAUCE"".  I WOULD NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM AGAIN.",2
"I really hoped I'd like this one. Absolutely Not. I found the noodles to be ""squishy"" and the broth tasted a little bit fishy to me. I had to toss it and the remaining 5 Cups out as well. I can't say it's a faulty product, just that I didn't like the taste and noodle texture. Amazon is an amazing way to try out things that might not be easily available locally, so I'm glad that I tried it at least.",2
It has a not unpleasant taste to it but it does not taste like a strawberry milkshake.  I tried one carton from the local store and have decided not to buy this product again.,2
"Usually my cats love Tiki Cat, but after buying this batch, they threw up each time they ate it.  I am worried it is a tainted batch and I may be poisoning them!  Be careful when buying from this seller",1
"I'm not one to write reviews, but the sweet potato was so disgusting that it is worth mentioning.  It was not bright orange, but rather dark and it smelled and tasted like burnt sweet potatoes.  My 7 month old, who is not by any means a picky eater, was repulsed by these.",1
"I ordered this olive oil as part of my eating healthy initiative.  I just received this product and have not had a chance to taste it yet.  However, any potential buyers should be aware that this olive oil is packaged in a #1 PET plastic bottle.  There are studies that suggest that endocrine-disrupting chemicals may leach out of PET plastic, particularly over time in the container.  See Wiki article:<br />search 'wiki Polyethylene terephthalate',<br />and this:<br />search 'Polyethylene Terephthalate May Yield Endocrine Disruptors' for details.<br /><br />While an effect from leached chemicals is not proven, the plastic container would have stopped me from buying this olive oil, had I known it was not packaged in glass.<br />I will addend the review when I have had a chance to taste this oil, but my initial sense is that the 'Baja' in Baja Precious may more accurately translate as 'sick leave' rather than the presumably intended 'drop in price'.",2
"Since I discovered this wonderful relish in England a few years ago I have tried to buy replacements in this country. It is served at most pubs in the UK as part of a Ploughman's Lunch along with various cheeses and other goodies. It has a wonderful taste and texture, unlike anything in this country. I recommend every one buy some. I've found it only on Amazon.",5
The Cinnamon Fusions coffee was extremely weak. I added additional Cinnamon to enhance the flavor.,3
"I bought a 10 pack of this snow cone syrup for my grandchildren & they just love it. The taste is great & it's nice having it already to go, no mixing. I would/will be buying from them again.",5
"I love the smaller size of these cans so the cats can eat them in one sitting, and the quality seems very high.  The cats both love them, and they are know to be picky eaters.  My husband commented they looked like 'people food' :) I think this is a very good product and I would buy it again.",5
"What's the nicest thing you can say about a cookie?  It's crisp? It's not too sweet?  It's made with graham flour?  It's a Honey Maid graham cracker?<br /><br />Just when I thought they couldn't be improved on, someone thought of small packets to retain freshness.<br /><br />I confess:  I too often eat grahams and milk at night and this is ideal.  Of course others may have better eating habits, but for those on the go or lunch boxes, or midnight sneaking, er, snacks, this new packaging of an old favorite works for me.<br /><br />The bottom line:  Five stars.  It's a great packaging idea for an old favorite; it should please those who love graham crackers.",5
"The Good: The Marley Coffee One Love coffee pods are simple to use and even simpler to clean up.  Just remove the pod from the basket and throw away.  At $10 a box, the price per cup is not bad, either.<br /><br />The Bad:  The coffee is weak tasting.  I tried several pods with differing amounts of water and the coffee still tasted weak.  My pods were ""Exotic Floral and Berry"" flavored and this flavoring gave the coffee a strong, unpleasant aftertaste.  It didn't seem too bad the first few sips, but the aftertaste became more and more unpleasant as I drank the coffee.  I could not finish a full cup.  My daughter and my sister also tried the coffee and they thought it had an unpleasant taste.  Part of the problem could be that I am not fond of flavored coffees.  I believe that Marley Coffee comes in an espresso flavor and that might be better.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this coffee.",2
"The ""experts"" say that the k-cup method of making coffee is wonderful for its ease and quickness and makes a very nice brew for those that like favored and/or medium roast coffee, but is not capable of making a robust cup for those that like their brew powerful!! I would have to agree!! I have tried just about every dark roast, french roast, italian roast coffee sold by Amazon and the only one that comes close to robust, in my opinion, is Coffee People's ""Wake-Up Call"". ""Dark Magic"" has a sweetness to it, which is not to my taste. Overall, OK, but not a winner in robust flavor!!",3
The coffee is very weak. Even the Bold flavor is very weak. I would not buy this again. The coffee tastes like water.,1
"Quaker Oatmeal Squares with a Hint of Brown Sugar come out of the box quite sweet enough for me, and that's something, considering how attached I have become to that Southern favorite, sweet iced tea.  They've also got a nice crunch to them, and I've found them tasty for breakfast, or as a snack. The soluble oatmeal is a good way to help satisfy the federal dietary guidelines suggested daily whole grain consumption.  And, of course, this cereal is a useful baby step towards keeping your heart healthy.<br /><br />The Quaker product contains 46 grams of whole grain per one cup (56 grams) serving, of which there are about eleven in the box.  This is 96% of the guidelines' suggested minimum whole grain requirement per serving.  There are 210 calories per serving, 6  grams of protein per serving, 0.5% saturated fat, 2% of the daily suggested intake of that element.  190 mg of sodium, 8% of the daily suggested.  9 g of sugars; 5 g of fiber, which is 19% of the daily suggested. There is no trans fat, only 1 g each of polyunsaturated fat and monounsaturated fat per serving. As I look through the ingredients, I actually see nothing that I'm trying to avoid, no high-fructose corn syrup, etc.<br /><br />The federal guidelines say that diets rich in whole grain foods and other plant foods may help reduce the risk of heart disease.  This product offers 3 g of soluble fiber a serving, a handy keystone to a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol. Diet experts recommend eating at least three one-ounce servings of whole grains, or 48 grams, daily, based on a 2,000 calorie daily diet.  So here you have 46 grams of whole grains per serving.  Handy, right?<br /><br />So it tastes good, and it's good for you, a winning combo.  A good food to try.",4
"Panch Phoron is a Bengali melange of five spices, combining for a wonderful mix of tastes. It's sometimes hard to find in the U.S., and when you do find it, some brands substitute cheaper seeds instead of the correct five spices. This brand is a good one and I would be completely satisfied if it weren't so expensive.",4
"My dogs love them, but boy do they smell.  I give them to enjoy outside.  Came very fast. Will reorder",4
This 5lb bag will probably last 6 months because of how stale the gummies are. They still taste great but they are nearly impossible to chew. I portion out the serving size and then suck on them which I guess is a plus if you're dieting.,3
I purchased about 4 bottles of this product with a great deal of anticipation. I was not happy with the sauce due to the extreme saltiness. It actually ruined our dinner which was beef kabobs. Amazon provided their usual excellent service with delivery in a timely fashion.,2
"This sauce is easy to make, but very mild (even weak) compared to other Noh sauces.  I guess this is OK if you are looking for a subtle teriyaki flavor that doesn't smother your meat's natural flavor (like most American BBQ sauces do).",3

"My husband and I were introduced to Pilon when living in Florida 5 years ago. Later when we moved to Colorado we were very disappointed when we couldn't find anyone that sold Pilon coffee.

We were so happy when we learned that we could buy it on line and have it delivered to our home.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />d. grubbs",5
"REMEMBER THE OLD WAY OF STIRRING PEANUT BUTTER?<br /><br />I think you've all experienced trying to stir a fresh jar of viscous separated peanut butter before. You stick a knife in and stir and stir and stir. In about a minute your hand starts to cramp so you try to use more of your arm. That's when you get clumsy and the oil starts to spill over the sides. The jar gets slippery making it difficult to grab onto its side; plus you've left a mess on the countertop. 10 minutes later you're still stuck with big clumps of peanut and a pool of sludge on the top.<br /><br />THE NEW WAY:<br /><br />This gadget eliminates the mess and gets the job done in about 5 minutes.<br /><br />SOME TIPS:<br /><br />- Place the jar on a oven mit when stirring so that it doesn't slip.<br /><br />- After the peanut butter is mixed (and of course after you've taken the stirrer+lid out) just store it in the fridge to prevent separation. To use the peanut butter just nuke in microwave  (without the lid of course) for about 30 seconds.<br /><br />- If you typically buy the larger peanut butter jars, go to Witmer's web site and order the larger stirrer. The deluxe kit comes with lids of both sizes.",5
"I just opened this bag of Goji Berries, ate a handful and spit it out.  I emptied the bag onto a paper towel to examine.  The berries are moldy & lots of bits & pieces of seeds, stems, & half eaten parts of berries from insects or worms perhaps. It tasted like mold.  I checked the stale date, 9/26/13.  Yikes!  I can't imagine eating these a year and a half from now.  The item is not returnable.  It says USDA organic on package.  It's a product from China. Very poor quality.  I don't trust it, & will never buy it again.",1
"The fact that this comes as leaves wrapped in pearls makes it easy to steep and is not messy.  The flavor is wonderful, not bitter, and the Jasmine adds a subtle and aromatic touch. Also, the pearls can be steeped three times before being expended.  Wonderful tea.",5
"You can compare it to unsweetened black tea, but palpable and soothing.  It is one of nature's best blood purifiers in addition to being great for women anytime.  It's great year round and for flu season, and you can ice it too.  Sweeten it up with a bag of chamomile or red clover. Spearmint & peppermint tea compliment it well too -- or add value to that flavored stuff from the supermarket w/this.<br /><br />You can drink this like water and I can't say enough about how good this tea is for well being, you'll probably instantly feel better.",5
"This was one of the first K-Cup blends I tried. It's a very light coffee, and I was very disappointed with it as a hot drink. After some looking around I found people put it in the fridge and then have it as iced coffee.<br /><br />This is genius. The coconut flavor really pops when the coffee is cold, and it doesn't taste watery. I would not attempt to make it like the specifically iced drink K-cups but if you have time to spare, putting a cup of it in the fridge really makes it better...maybe add some chocolate syrup to it while it's still hot too...",4
"As an endurance athlete there a 2 things I need, water and caffeine. My stomach and palate can't handle sugary beverages so this really fills a gap in my training. The water tastes great and now that's its available locally, its an absolute no brainer!  Forget about the afternoon coffee or soda, go Element.  Great Product!",5
"I ordered these because of the fairly high reviews.  Honestly, I expected more.  Do they taste good?  Sure, for instant noodles they are passable.  I do like spicy food and don't find these to be hot at all.  They are a touch better than the generic noodles in a cup, but I don't think these warrant the price.  I didn't have the ""ah, these are actually kind of tasty"" feeling when I finished the first cup I tried.  With that said, I will finish the five cups I have left, but I doubt I will ever order these again.",3
"This is a lovely flavor and makes a lovely presentation.  I made pink rose cupcakes with rose icing, it was a big hit with the office ladies.",4
"Have been put on a rather restricted diet in the last year due to a crazy disease that does not tolerate acidic foods.  It's kind of a trial and error thing of what I can tolerate.  Rice/corn cakes seem to be acceptable and help satisfy my ""munchies"" without adding a lot of calories.<br />The order was delivered in a timely manner and product was fresh and intact.",4
"I actually love both systems but I find the Senseo coffee to be easier on my stomach without a loss of flavor. The Senseo pods are much easier to composite given there is no plastic in the container, just paper. However, the fact that there is somewhat less of a mess with the Keurig pod, consumers are more apt to go with this convenience than with the recycling aspect. Alas, we can not find Senseo in our supermarkets anymore.",5
"I looked high and low for over a year trying to find this salad dressing.  It won awards for best salad dressing two years in a row at the Fancy Food show.  I finally found it here.  To be honest, I don't love it.  It tastes a bit like the Italian salad dressing offered at many inexpensive salad bars I used to go to.  I am surprised because I buy a lot of products from this company and all of them have been amazingly delicious.  This isn't my favorite.",3
"We have tried a couple of single serve coffee varieties to offer guests and put out along with our single serve tea selections at parties and gatherings. Nearly all foods in our home is organic or better so I am only comparing this with other organic single serve varieties we have tried (and there aren't that many). This is by far the best one we have tried. Even our coffee-discerning Colombian friend really likes this coffee. It is a true medium roast, not too rich or bitter. Very smooth and not acidic. Good enough to have with cream alone. When this box is through, I will buy this one again!<br /><br />I hope this was helpful. Thanks for reading!",5
"These are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouth.<br /><br />For my entire life Sour Cream & Onion (and in this case ""& Chive"") chips were my favorite. Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them. Hopefully they'll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips.",1

"I agree with the other comments wholeheartedly. One piece of Vivani 85% is totally satisfying. Much more accessible than other 85% chocolate, and after a while, everything else tastes too sweet. I keep trying others and come back to Vivani. Also, I'm very sensitive to stimulants and have noticed that different brands have differing effects on me--I can't sleep, for instance, if I have a teeny piece of Choc-O-Love. Vivani makes me happy without sending me to the moon.",5
"The SHU strength of this cayenne is listed as being about one-third less than  the capsules I was using (90,000)but it tastes just as HOT! You can tell it is also very fresh.<br /><br />Some advice: Try to use whatever amount you take either sprinkled on food or, like I do, about an eight to one-quarter teaspoon mixed with about 8 oz of liquid. If you take the capsule form straight (which you can open up), it will shock your system when it explodes in your stomach, possibly doing harm.",5
"The bitterness in this tea is way too strong, and the flavor weak. It leaves a strange, bad taste on the sides on my mouth when I drink it plain. It's only really drinkable with milk and sugar, or iced with sugar.<br /><br />Instead, I'd recommend trying a nice looseleaf black tea. Failing that, try Lipton's Black Pearl if you want a decent bagged tea that is easy to find. Twinings ""Prince of Wales"" is another good bagged tea.<br /><br />BTW, ""Orange Pekoe"" does not refer to the flavor of the tea. It refers to the size of the tea leaf pieces. Strangely, Orange Pekoe is used for large pieces, whereas this tea contains smaller pieces - yielding more bitterness. I'm not sure why they use this term.",2
This tastes terrible. I am used to having a flavored protein and the strong flavor is really gross and hard to mask. I wasted $25. :/,1

"Anyone interested in The Zone, these are 13g carbs, only 4g protein. Completely out of the zone... as most bars are. Of course you can't find that info here on Amazon, gotta go poke around the Kind website, and after a while, there it is. So, beware!",2
I ordered these to bring into work to add some 'salty' to the sweet snacks we always have here.  They are great!  Everyone loves having them around.  I'll gladly order them again when the supply has diminished.,4
I purchased Marshalls Creek bay leaves and what a waste of money that ended up being.  I had spider webs and mold somehow inside the supposedly sealed container.  I purchased 5 other Marshalls Creek herbs and seasoning and I noticed similiar situations with those as well.,1
The dogs love CORE.  My son's dog was given a choice of CORE and another dog food.  He ate the CORE and left the other dog food in the bowl.,5
"I want to start  by saying that if I was reviewing the food alone, it would get 5 stars easily.  It's a quality product and my picky eater cat (as in, he would literally rather go hungry for days on end than be coaxed into eating something he doesn't like) loves it.<br /><br />Having said that, I won't buy this (or any other canned product for that matter) from Amazon.com anymore, unless they were to significantly change their packaging method. Normally I only review a product all on its own because other factors are incidental, but this time it seemed fitting to comment on shipping too because it drastically affected the overall quality of the product and is an unavoidable part of getting it to any customer.<br /><br />The product arrives in a small cardboard flat with 2 layers of 12 cans each, then the whole thing is shrink-wrapped in plastic.  Then they put it in a shipping box and put 3 air pillows on top.  Exactly 1/2 of the cans arrived dented (the entire bottom tier of the flat), many of them so badly that it looked like they had been run over by a car.<br /><br />Amazon.com customer service is great and responsive - they shipped the replacement out with complimentary next-day shipping... and it arrived in exactly the same condition.  In the end, I got everything I paid for, but 1. do I want to go through this every time I order it? No.  And 2. it's hugely wasteful because of course the dented cans are unusable because the seal could be compromised, offering the perfect breeding ground for botulism.<br /><br />I can fairly say that this is typcial for canned products in general from Amazon, too.  I've gotten black beans, kidney beans, chick peas, tomato sauce, and tomato paste from them, and there wasn't one order among them that didn't have the same problem.  Again, customer service was great and sent quick replacements (again with a high damage rate), but it's not worth the hassle and waste.  If it ever occurs to them to pad the entire order and not just the top of it, I'll return to using them because the free shipping and convenience of subscription auto-order (and subsequent additional savings) really are nice.",2
"My father and I have been eating this noodle for a few years now. Though it is more expensive than some of the lesser noodles, it is definitely good value because of the texture and taste, also considering that it is 4.2 oz instead of 2~3 oz of some other packaged noodles.<br /><br />Adding vegetables, seafood, eggs, and meat makes the noodle a full meal for me, quite satisfying after a long cold day working in the field. For my taste, I only use 1/2 of the seasoning package. Full pack is definitely too spicy for me.<br /><br />Unfortunately the label listed at Amazon website says 4.2 oz ""bowl,"" a more convenient way to prepare my noodles when sometimes I only have a microwave oven available. When I got the delivery, these turn out just regular ""packages"" instead of bowls. A disappointment at least, and the term ""fraud"" came to mind when I looked at what I got versus what I thought I was getting.<br /><br />Well, Amazon probably did not know the difference and counting on what the manufacturer specified. It would be nice if Amazon would correct the label on the website so those who are looking for noodle bowls instead of the regular packages will not be misled like I was.",4
I've tried this product twice now and I have to concur with the other positive reviews.  It makes me more alert and has a subtle but positive effect on my mood.  It seems too good to be true.,5
I threw out the Natural Balance dog food I had on hand (both the vegetarian and bison/sweet potato formulas)and won't be buying any more after reading complaints on ConsumerAffairs.com website regarding pets that died after eating tainted Natural Balance. A very disturbing aspect is that the company did not recall any of their pet food or even admit the problem even though they were notified multiple pets died or became very ill (with similar symptoms) quite suddenly and soon after eating the product. No more Natural Balance for my dog.,1
"Maybe my expectations were too high but this seemed to have almost no flavor at all. After following the instructions and ending up with a bland outcome, I added some butter and salt. Then more salt. It got saltier, but I could taste little else. Last time I checked, 'real' cheese was supposed to have flavor. I get that it's healthier than the blue box, but I would rather just have no mac & cheese at all if this is the only alternative.",2
"True to the name, Food Should Taste This Good, these tasty little chips really deliver. So fresh, no taste of stale cooking oil! Just the right amount of salt and crispy crunch and the touch of olive makes for a very sophisticated little chip. Small and sturdy enough for bite size dipping. Highly recommended!",5
"I was looking forward to this product, as my wife and I both like Earl Grey tea, and decaf lets us drink it at night.  We drink a variety of tea, so we don't go through individual tea very quickly, so I was looking forward to the resealable packets.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this tea just doesn't taste good initially and has a particularly unpleasant aftertaste.  I definitely would not recommend buying this tea.",1
"These bars taste fine, though neither the orange nor cranberry is very pronounced. Mostly it's just CHOCOLATE. Which is not a bad thing. :)<br /><br />However, the texture was the main failing, for me. I'm sure this is just an effect of trying to maintain some semblance of good nutrition, but the bars were a little dry and crumbly, like not-quite-right brownies. They aren't bad, but they kept reminding me of something really tasty... and not being that really tasty thing.<br /><br />Worth a try, if you feel inclined. Just don't eat them where crumbs will be a problem!",3
"This is my least favorite flavor, I find it bland.  But these small bags are great for kids lunches, and a nice alternative to fattening chips.  The chips have a great texture for not being fried.",4

The product gets a four star vote because of that minus the one for the freshness.<br />I recently purchased these again from the drug store and I have lowered my rating for this item accordingly.  The freshness is very important.  From the drug store they get a 5 star, so it is not the product but the seller that matters.",2
"Yuck! What a waste of $$! All the drinks taste like grapegruit and the carbonation doesn't help any. The energy ones didn't give me any additional energy, the calming ones didn't help me be any calmer. Totally overpriced and if you want to drink grapefruit juice, juice your own up. Save your $.",2
"I'm not much of a cereal eater, but have always been a fan of raisin bran.  So, I was curious about this new version.  It's delicious!  Plenty of almond taste, plus raisins, and plus these little sweet crunchy clusters.  The cinnamon flavor was light, not overpowering at all.  I had some for dinner the other other night, and it was so good I had a second bowl.  I will definitely buy this in the future!",5
This has been one of my favorites for many years.  It is now a favorite of all my family.  I buy it from Amazon in bulk.,5

"I love ginger and haven't had it for a few years and I stumbled upon it here and when I read the reviews where people said it was too spicy I said to myself I have to try it!<br /><br />When I cut open the box, I accidentally sliced the non resealable two 16 ounce foil bags that were in a plastic bag. I don't mess around when I open shipping boxes and I could tell I sliced the foil bag. So I took a finger tip full of the ginger around my accidental slice and WOW! There definitely is a bite to it, but notlike a fingertipful of hot chili powder.<br /><br />The powder was pale gold which the picture describes and is a lot lumpier. The two foil bags are not resealable. I just cut the top off of one with a scissors and poured them in my containers. Easy pouring.<br /><br />I took the end of my teaspoon and filled it. I don't know if most put a full teaspoonful in and perhaps that's why to some it was super hot, but a teaspoon endful was plenty for my hot tea.<br /><br />When I ordered it and it had those choices of a schedule, and the ""one time only delivery"" I asked about that after I ordered because I'd never seen that before and if I liked this ginger I didn't want to be on a schedule  with automatic deductions because who knows if it's ever discontinued and it doesn't go out if you'll be refunded.<br /><br />This is very good ginger. It's worth the price. It's got just enough bite and it's by no means as tame as store bought, at least with me. These two bags will last months and when the time comes I'll definitely re-order.",5
"This is a fine product.  My daughter eats it right up and seems to enjoy it.  I will say however that it is very liquidy (no texture) so I have more drips when feeding her.  I wish it were a bit more solid in texture (I really like Plum Baby Food due to the texture).  Again, daughter loves it.",4
"I can't say anything positive about the taste - maybe I'll try to mix it up with fruit or something, but it may cause me to start disliking fruit due to pure negative association.  I really hope the health benefits advertised are worth it.  Maybe I should just stick with popping vitamins (ugh).",2
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M074ME"">Melitta One:One Java Pods, Love At First Sip, Medium Roast Coffee, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>I was very disappointed in this Melitta product. The pods were too thick for my Senseo coffeemaker. And the coffee produced is definitely not as smooth as the Senseo Medium Strength pods produce.<br /><br />Do not use these Melitta's in a Senseo machine. The hinge of the movable top was very strained due to the extra thickness of these Melitta pods. I'm sure the plastic bits around the hinge would have failed if I continued to use the Melitta pods.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon and they, nicely, and quickly refunded my purchase price. Thanks, Amazon.<br /><br />MJR",1
"I just found part of a sticker (those little stickers attached to most fruits at the store) melted to one of the apple pieces!  They do a lousy job in cleaning the fruit.  The reason I took off another star is because there are some dirty apple chips in the bag.  I suppose it's from the bottom of the apple stem where it can be a little dirty or furry and they just bake the whole part!  They need a bit more quality control.  I end up throwing out between 5%-10% of the apples because they contain a stem, dirty, etc.<br /><br />9/23/13: Found another sticker attached to an apple piece.  Customer service only takes the information, but does nothing.",2
"Something is not right. Tastes very old. Stale. Weak. Weak at 8 ounces. Weak at 6 ounces. Strength OK at 4 ounces but tastes horrible. Not only will I not buy this coffee again, I won't buy Green Mountain coffee again. Very bad.",1
"I bought this gum at Fred Meyer today because it looked good and I've never seen it before. I usually buy the ""Tropical Twist"" by Trident and love that flavor, so I thought this would turn out to be good also. Both packs have pictures of oranges and a few other fruits on them, so I figured they'd be comparable. I chew gum a lot to try and prevent me from snacking when I'm not really hungry and because I have read in numerous places that chewing sugar free gum is good for your teeth.<br /><br />So, here's the scoop. The flavor is a 2.5/5, not nearly as yummy as the tropical one. I timed how long the flavor lasts and I got about 7 minutes out of it before I was anxiously searching for a garbage can to throw it out in. The aftertaste wasn't  horrible, but wasn't great either.  Bottom line, I give it a try and now I'm going to try and pawn this pack of gum off on my co-workers and keep chewing the ""Tropical Twist"" and ""Bubblegum"" flavors.",2
"i was shopping for SUGAR-FREE cookies, so they suggested other SUGAR-FREE cookies and i selected them, unfortunately, i'm a diabetic, and when i received the ""lucy"" chocolate chip cookies: NOT only were they assorted flavors (Which i DIDNT order) BUT they were NOT SUGAR-FREE!! why would they suggest these i have NO idea,but i'm very upset.",1
Looks like they didn't really taste test this product.  Nothing in the realm of dark chocolate springs to mind when drinking it.  We were disappointed.,2
"My husband is the coffee drinker in the family.  And, after years of selecting and grinding the beans, steeping the coffee, he decided to try the coffee bags.  He decided he liked the taste and it was so quick and easy.  I let the coffee bag steep much longer than is recommended(5 minutes) and also dunk the bag for about 1 minute.",4
"Due partially to the use of Splenda, Murrays makes the best-tasting sugar free cookies out there.  But don't forget they still have carbs! Chocolate chip is my personal favorite.",5
I really like this tea.  It tastes quite similar to Sencha Shots which are also very good. The 16.9 oz bottles are perfect.,5
"I have to focus on the aspects that I can detect (taste and smell) and not ones on which I could only speculate (potency of antioxidants).<br /><br />This tea has very little flavor.  It smells as if it will have a rich, fruity flavor but that is not at all the case.  There is no raspberry in it.  The name of the tea is ""Green Tea Superfruit (Red Goji and Respberry)"".  It contains (green tea, natural flavor, soy lecithin, blueberry juice solids, concentrated goji juice solids)<br /><br />No raspberry at all... So I guess the ""natural flavor"" is raspberry flavor?  Why not just include raspberry juice solids or concentrated raspberry juice solids?<br /><br />Anyway, the net here is that it is green tea with a questionable attempt at being true to its name of ""Red Goji and Raspberry""... It does not taste bad, it simply doesn't taste like much at all.  I will continue to drink it (and the other 5 boxes I bought in my six-pack), as there is nothing in the ingredients list that I specifically disapprove of and I will trust the antioxidant counts they provide, that come from the green tea itself.  I might turn it into iced tea in the summer and add lemonade to it so it will have some flavor.<br /><br />I would not buy this again but would try another variety of Lipton (or other) Green Tea.  Other Lipton teas (like the Pyramid Bedtime Story) have been excellent.",3
We are at week 16 and still no tomatoes after following instructions to a T. Get the herbs. They last and are easy to maintain.,2

"For caffeine coffee drinkers, this is a good way to mix up parts with real coffee to get yourself off of ""regular"". I also liked that it was brown and looked like coffee, instead of the tea color that you get from drinking, well tea. :)<br /><br />It is definitely an acquired taste and since I really enjoyed coffee, I got used to the herbal coffee, but again, this flavor was OK for me. I liked the Hazelnut best & the Chocolate better than the Vanilla Nut.<br /><br />Overall, Im glad this product was available so I could kick the caffeine habit.",3
"This pod has a very nice flavor in a medium roast. For pod coffee makers that aren't too fussy about pod size it would be fine, but for Senseo (I have the 7810, regular machine) the size is slightly problematic. One pod just fits in the one-pod holder, but if you make a full (single) cup it's not very strong. Two pods are too thick for the two-pod Senseo holder. So what I've done is to run a half-cup with one pod in the single holder, stop the machine and change to a second pod (both pre-moistened) and run the second half of the cup. This makes a nice cup of coffee, but the extra step is kind of a pain.<br /><br />Revisiting this a couple of weeks later, I was too harsh. Thing is, I'm used to a really strong cup of coffee, and often drink French Roast or espresso. This coffee is a lighter roast - as a Breakfast Blend should be - so it has a lighter flavor. The pod is a little unusual in size, as I originally wrote (it's larger than a standard Senseo brand pod, but smaller than, for example, a Baronet), and you can't fit two in a double-pod holder. But as I've experimented, if I pre-wet the pod and put one in a single-pod holder and pull a regular single cup, the result is a really nice (small, not giant American style) cup of coffee, with excellent flavor. I'm leaving it at 4 stars as I think it could be a slightly heavier pod for even more flavor, but this actually has become one of my favorites.",4
"The hot chocolate is my husband's favorite.  Service was also great, as it usually is.  Very popular now with winter coming on.",5
"This is definetely not the Colombian produced Milo I grew up with. It varies in flavor from country to country of origin. Not bad, but not the same",3
"The new frustration free packaging for k-cups is terrific! Thank you AMAZON.COM.  Gloria Jean's Hazelnut is one of our favorites for flavored coffee. Second only to their Butter Toffee. However, if you are wanting a bold wake-me-up, this is not going to please you. It's a pretty mild blend. When will someone make a really bold flavored coffee? Surely it is possible. I am a big fan of Emeril's Big Easy for my morning brew but later in the day or after dinner, Gloria Jean's Hazlenut is perfect.",4
"This is an excellent soy sauce, the taste is light and sparkling and it won't overwhelm your meat or vegetable taste. I discover it in ""Asian food to go"" with small condiment packages and it satisfies everytime. No, it won't bring your food to new dimension, it enhances the taste of your main ingredient whatever it is - meat, poultry or seafood if you prefer it to salt.<br /><br />Regarding expiration date - soy sauce or fish sauce can last for years if full and unopened in a bottle, if it comes in a big bottle, pour them in smaller glass bottles to the rim with air tight lids, put in dark place and use one at a time to prevent oxidation that spoils and alters the taste. Air and temp spoil foods<br /><br />I have tried different brand of soy sauces, this is the most satisfied soy sauce available in USA",5
"I received the package very quickly -- when I opened the box, there were<br />approximately 14 containers that were leaking -- this causes the liquid to<br />flow over the entire order -- the remaining containers had to be washed due<br />to the ""sticky"" material on them. I understand that this is a constant<br />happening -- a better method of packaging should be looked into.<br /><br />I have ordered another package of the product knowing that I and others were not happy in the way that we received the said items,<br />But, I must say that both boxes of the International Delight Irish Cream, were received in the best of conditions. The negative<br />remarks made before, did help -- I am more than pleased with your product -- not one , that is correct, not one was leaking.<br />Thank you for correcting the problem.<br />Sando Cosenza",3
"I often wonder how much time is invested in making dog food look like something we feel better about giving to our pets. This food looks nice, different colors, 'meaty' looking moist chunks and my dog loves eating it.<br /><br />It's over $2 a pound so it should be great right?<br /><br />But, after reading up on the food at dog food advisor dot com I would never get this food again. It can be deceiving that beef is the first ingredient. But as it is explained in the review at dog food advisor, that is the weight of the beef before drying and processing - which contains a lot of water. So after processing, it is probably a much lower percentage of ingredient. Then there were other questionable ingredients including animal fat - the origin can be from a number of gross places, and a high corn meal content.<br /><br />So, I think much of the high price comes from the processing to make it look better to us and therefore make us feel better giving it to our dogs.<br /><br />I think I'm going back to my 4/5 star Kirkland dog food.",2
This coffee has no depth of flavor though it does have a chocolate aftertaste.  The best way I've found to drink it is a double shot with a splash of half & half.,3
"Had I known this cocoa was sugar-free, I would not have purchased it. I realize that this will not bother some people, but I really don't like the aftertaste of fake sugar.  In the interest of fairness, this did not seem to trouble my nephew!  Just update the description.",2
"Was served this at a hotel while traveling was very happy to find it available on Amazon. Nice fruity flavor to enjoy on a warm summer afternoon. Served it over ice,the slightly tart flavor tickled my taste buds and refreshed me.",4
"I really enjoy the flavor of this drink and its really easy to make.<br />It reminds me of eating pumpkin pie.<br /><br />I tend to use more than they tell you to use in order to get the sweetness I desire but is really preference.<br />I also use milk instead of water.  It makes it creamier and that is the way I like it.<br /><br />I haven't purchased any of these in a long time and I was surprised to learn they are in plastic now instead of tins like they used to be.  I guess I shouldn't have been.  In any event, its probably cleaner anyways.<br /><br />If the name Pumpkin Spice makes you think you might like it then I would say that you will because it tastes very near to what I was thinking it would taste like and I love it.<br /><br />Also fits the season perfectly.",5

When I would drink from the coffeepot, it was sooooo good.  It didn't seem to have the same flavor from the t-discs.  I wouldn't buy it again.  Maybe it is the strength of the t-disc?  I prefer it kind of strong.",2
I made waffles from this mix and everyone raved how good they were. The kids couldn't get enough. No more Eggos in this house...it's Garvey's from now on!,5
My dog loves these. The doggie store suggested to me that these were more effective than greenies in cleaning teeth but who knows. Sage seemed more apoplectic when offered these vs. Greenies. The packaging is really nice and the idea of Fliet Mignon really appealed to Sage. slightly more expensive than greenies and fewer choices.,5
"I ordered this cereal because my son and I LOVE chocolate but this cereal center did not taste like chocolate. It was more like some odd chemical burnt tasting soft stuff.

I put the rest of the box outside for the wildlife. Don't waste your money on this one.",2

They range in age from one to eighteen, in weight from eight to thirteen pounds, and include both genders.<br /><br />To test the treats on the focus group, I broke the Bites into cat-size pieces and offered the pieces to the felines on two consecutive days.  On the first try, two of the group ate their pieces, one licked at it but did not eat it, and the fourth cat walked away.<br /><br />I tried again on the second day.  This time, none of them would eat it; they all walked away.<br /><br />Clearly, the Boost Bites may be ok for dogs, but hold little interest for cats.

"Let me just say up front that if I am hungry i will eat about anything.  This Pesto (without any pine nuts) is terrible.  Save you money.  It had good reviews and since I live in the Baja I thought i would try it since it had such good reviews and we can not buy this sort of stuff here where I live.<br /><br />Honestly, save you money.  There is not really a ""Pesto flavor"" with this product and it has a rancid sort of ""off"" taste to it.  Six very small (3 oz) jars are over $20.00.  It is fairly ""pricey"" to start with and since it has a terrible taste then it is ridiculously priced in my opinion.<br /><br />I am so irritated i bought this crapola and of course Amazon will not accept a return on it.  My reccomendation is the Classico brand ""Traditional Basil Pesto sauce and spread"".  I paid, i believe $2.00 a jar for the Classico brand of pesto on sale at a WalMart.  The jar size is 8.1 oz and i had five large meals with the Classico pesto sauce which has a wonderful flavor.  I boiled some Johnsonville sausage in a pan and afterwards boiled my pasta in the same pan of sausage water.  Had the Classico Brand of pesto with my pasta and the flavor was wonderful!  The Classico Pesto sauce was incredible on the sliced sausage.  So i tried to duplicte the same meal with the Roland Petso sauce and i barely ate half of it and tossed the rest.  I won't be eating the remainder of this RolandPestoCrapola.  I realize that individual tastes vary greatly but I can NOT imagine anyone choosing the Roland Pesto.",1
"I fed my dog Iams Proactive Health for five years before realizing that it is a very unhealthy, low-quality, and species-innappropriate dog food.<br /><br />The package states ""No fillers.""  However, take a look at the first five ingredients...chicken, corn meal, ground whole grain sorghum, chicken byproduct meal, dried beet pulp.  The last four of the first five ingredients are fillers!  Also, the first ingredient, chicken, probably occupies a lower position on the list because, after cooking, most of the moisture is lost and chicken is about 80% moisture. [1][2]<br /><br />As to being species-inappropriate, have you ever heard of a wolf attacking a corn stalk?<br /><br />After I started researching dog food, I switched my dog to Taste of the Wild, a grain-free kibble, and Bravo Balance, raw dog food.  When my dog was eating Iams, she often left food in her bowl for several hours.  Now she eats her food as soon as I give it to her.  Also, her coat is softer and she doesn't get constipated anymore (she did every now and then eating Iams).<br /><br />Yes, Iams is ""vet-recommended"" and my vet approved of it.  However, I have reason to believe that many vets have been improperly and undereducated in nutrition, and the education that they do receive is biased.  Hill's Pet Nutrition Inc., which makes ""Hill's Science Diet"" with similar ingredients to Iams, has created and distributes a nutrition curriculum to vet schools around the world.  They also administer the Hill's vet school graduate feeding program, which provides pet food to students at no charge that they can resell for a profit.  In addition to providing course materials to veterinary students, Hills's, Iams, Purina, and other well-known manufacturers also offer additional perks for students. [3][4]<br /><br />Please, do not believe pet food companies' claims without looking at the ingredients for yourself!  It's a pay now or pay later situation.  If you feed your dog a high-quality, wholesome food now you will have to pay less in vet bills later.

ORDERING FLOWERS ONLINE WAS SIMPLY EASY PICKINGS.  Delivery was made on times. Just have an issue with the Flowers. They did not last long. Three days the most.,3
"I loved this product. The idea is perfect...healthy food for baby, minimal clean up, compact design. 1-2 times a week, I would use both the steaming and blending function to make 2-3 purees for the week. I also used the steaming function at least 2 times a day to heat up the frozen food. Everything seemed great, but after 3 months, the blending bowl started leaking. I changed the rubber gasket, but it still leaked. It turns out the bottom of the blending bowl had multiple cracks through it. I ended up buying a replacement bowl for $22. Hopefully it lasts longer this time. I also had similar problems that other people had with the brown stuff in the steaming reservoir. Overall, I probably would not have made this purchase. There are less expensive options out there. But after spending $150 on the thing, I had to replace the bowl, even if it was $22.",2
"I bought this product thinking it would be a great substitute for lemon peel  . I also wanted to save time from grating lemons . I put the product in lukewarm water to reconstitute it .

"This is one of those, ""now why didn't I think of that?!!"" products.  I thought the pouches were a great improvement but never thought about connecting an actual spoon to the pouch to make it even better.  I'm so glad Boon did!  I came on Amazon to buy another of the Book Squeeze Spoons and saw these.  It's exactly what I wanted and I didn't even know it.  I was squeezing the pouches into the Boon Squeeze Spoon - this removes an entire step and makes things every so easy.  And for people like me who want to use every last drop of the food it ends the frustration of knowing that I'm losing a little on the inside of this and the inside of the container I put the food into.  On the first use I was already developing a technique to get the most out of those pouches while squeezing it into the spoon - I'm a little crazy about stuff like that :)<br /><br />I know people complain about the spoon bowl being a little deeper than most baby spoons but I don't see it as a problem at all. When my babies are little they don't clean the spoon on the first pass, I either turn and tilt the spoon so they can get the last bit or forget about it and squirt more in.  It's not a big deal.  When they get older they'll clean it out just fine.  It's the same size as the Boon Squeeze Spoon so we're already used to it.<br /><br />The only concern I had was that these would get lost down the garbage disposer when tossed into the sink.  I solved that by putting in one of those mesh strainers that covers the drain.  All in all it's a great product!",5
"I was severely disappointed by this product. my dad gifted me a subscription to it, but with the lack of salt and abundance of raisins, it's just not something I can enjoy eating. If you like a shit ton of raisins and unsalted nuts, you'll probably be a fan of this, but I certainly was not.",2
I love the taste of these and would have given it 4 stars but the shipping price is outrageous. Shop around the internet for a good price,4
"These are a bit small, and sorta pricey as other reviewers have mentioned, but I actually like the smaller size - the larger ones are a bit too much for me.  So these are perfect.

Wish there was a variety pack of the big sized ones for my husband.",4

"I actually have local stores order this jelly and many of the other Aloha jellies for my family. I order 12 - 20 jars at a time and still, we covet and hoard it like it's gold. The slight peppery tanginess combined with the sweet smooth jelly adds a kick to the top of baked Brie (form tinfoil around the bottom and sides of the Brie, slice off the top of the Brie, add a good layer of jelly, bake in a 400 degree oven for 20 - 30 min - until you can see the jelly bubbling on top), takes bread and jelly to heaven (just bread with cheese broiled and topped with jelly), or and makes any piece of chicken or pork (put on before or after you bake it) the most delicious foods you'll taste in a long time.<br /><br />The only reason this jelly doesn't get a 5 star from me is that the cost, with shipping, is high. If you order from their Aloha website, you have to order 3 at a time but the shipping goes down substantially.<br /><br />Or, once you have tried a few of them, and offered them at dinner parties, you'll find yourself twisting the arms of your local stores to ship them in for you, your family, and your newly loyal friends!",4
"I didn't have the appropriate brewer, so I just had to steep it. That may have affected the taste some, but probably not.

What I do like about it is that it is organic and fair-trade.",3

Maybe it is because of the too yummy taste.<br /><br />Here is the nutritional information:<br />140 Calories<br />25 from Fat<br />3g fat (.5 saturated, .5 poly, 1.5 mono)<br />125mg Sodium<br />25g Carbs<br />4g Fiber (17%)<br />9g Sugar<br />3g Protein<br />8% Vitamin A<br />2% Calcium<br />4% Iron<br /><br />So, if you eat the whole box, it is only 700 Calories, 15g of fat and 625mg of Sodium.<br /><br />I liked them, but probably won't get them again as they are too much of an indulgence for me, I will have eaten 5 in just 24 hours.",4
"I bought this dog food after my twelve year old pit/hound mix stopped eating another major brand. He scarfs this up like it was a bowl of beef liver. The food is processed into small pellets about the size of a slightly flattened green pea which mixes thoroughly and easily with canned dog food, a bit of scrambled egg or a splash of chicken broth. However, our pooch seems to like it dry almost as much as mixed with other protein. Even the cats will nibble on any leftover bits during the day. Amazon offers a reasonable price and combined with Prime free shipping this provides a convenient alternative to hauling heavy bags of dog food home from the grocery store.",5
"These were awful.  I love mint and chocolate and thought this would be a nice treat to enjoy.  After the product arrived I popped one in my mouth and spit it out!  It's difficult to describe the taste, but it wasn't the 'minty-chocolatey' taste I was hoping for.",1
"Very little flavor.  Definitely not the salt cured jerky flavor that makes me a big fan of jerky, even turkey jerky.  This stuff even leaves an aftertaste.  No thanks, sending the rest back tonight for a refund.",1
"I adore sardines and have tried them all... at Trader Joe's (the worst! so dry and flavorless!), at Whole Foods, at local gourmet shops, imported from all parts of the world. These are succulent with the perfect, rich flavor. Even my baby (less than 1 yr old) loves to eat these (I wish I could give her more but they have added salt). If you want the best, these are the best. Don't even bother with the other King Oscar sardines.",5
"The salmon and potatoes was not what I ordered. My dog was using salmon and rice from Simple and I went to Amazon, to my last order and reorder the product.  What I received was the Salmon and potatoes.  Since I was out of his food I did give him the new product and now he his having allergy problems again.  I am dissapointed and will need to find a new food for him. He loves the taste but I would have though I would be notified that this was not the product on my products page.",2
Came super fast and good amount of sprinkles but they look like just regular green sprinkles not lime green at all. Will have to just use en anyway..,3
Love this faucet.  My husband had installed the same one in our old house so when our current faucet was leaking I told him not to fix it and we would buy the same one.  It was easy enough for him to install but he did need my assistance a few times to help hold some things in place. Looks great and works great.,5
Barely has a hint of the taste of bacon. Tastes more like the main ingredient..paprika. It's not terrible...just nowhere near tasting like real bacon.,2
"This mix and some nonfat milk provides an excellent starting point for all kinds of wonderful shakes. I like to add a handful of frozen fruit and two or three pumps of DaVinci sugar-free syrup. (My favorites are banana, pineapple or peach.) The finished product is thick and satisfying, exactly what this diabetic craves for her ""sweet tooth."" I was initially hesitant about the price, but one can yields enough to make at least two gallons so definitely it's a good value.",4
"Although a snap to prepare, this just isn't for me.  Most of all it's too sweet.  It also contains too many ingredients.  I prefer making my oatmeal the slow way, controlling the amount of sweetness and without all the additives.",2
"My dogs have been on Canidae for the past several years and even the picky dog who has lost over half her teeth loved it.  However, I recently bought a new bag of Canidae.  The packaging was different, but I thought that was the only thing that had changed because there was nothing on the bag indicating it was a new formula.<br /><br />I noticed the kibble was a lighter color than in previous bags, but still didn't think much of it. However, two out of my three dogs now consistently refuse to eat it.  The only dog who will eat this new bag is the one who has been on a diet for two years and quite frankly, will eat anything.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed that the change in the formula was not even mentioned on the bag and that they changed a great food into one that my dogs won't eat.<br /><br />NOTE: I emailed Canidae to ask why the formula had changed, and why it was not mentioned on the new bags.  Their response:<br /><br />*********<br />Our quality of raw material as well as quality control has actually increased not decreased. Yes we have diversified our complex carbohydrates as rice continues to climb and high quality availability decreases. Our products are better than ever and more consistent. We are getting a lot of positive feedback from our customers that are actually feeding their pets our improved formulas.<br />*********<br /><br />I hadn't actually said I thought their raw material decreased...just that 2 of my 3 dogs now refused to eat it.  And when they say they are getting positive feedback from our customers that are *actually* feeding the new formula, are they trying to imply that I only pretended to feed the new food?!?!",1
"I usually shop from here, but their prices aren't that great for candy, and lately they've been eliminating large size bags of hard candy. These are the original flavors. Only thing is if you eat too many, they color your tongue purple-red, and you'd better be prepared to brush your teeth (and tongue) well before bedtime after these!",3
"I love the concept. Living in New York apartment, it's great to be able to grow your own herbs. We use them for cooking and aromas are great. However in my first kit chives never came up. I spoke to customer support and they made me wait a few weeks before they have sent the chives replacement, but by the time it was too late, as all the other plants were huge, so the new seeds didn't really have a chance. I have planted my second kit a few weeks ago, and this time sage didn't sprout. Chives are also looking weak, dominated by huge basil and sorrel. Obviously, I am quite annoyed with dead seeds in both kits.",3
"Unlike most bottles of 'hot sauce' Tiger Sauce tends to be flavorful without melting inside skin of your mouth away. Rare? Indeed. I first experimented with this cooking sauce when I discovered the Asian art of wok cooking and making home made stir fry.<br /><br />Like your food with a tinge of heat and LOTS of flavor? Then THIS is the cooking sauce you'll grab again and again for all of your cooking needs. It's good to add into stir fry, fried rice, soups, stews, chili or for when you wish to sautee some meat such as chicken, pork or shrimp. (While it's ok for beef, I find that beef tends to soak this sauce up more so than chicken, shrimp or pork does).<br /><br />How much to use? Let your conscious be your guide! But to start with I'd use no more than a tablespoon of it with some cut up chicken chunks in the pan. Figure you're going to use 2 T of peanut or sesame oil to coat your wok/pan with to cook your meat and then when the meat begins to brown on the outside, just pour in the Tiger Sauce and let that sizzle in and flavor the meat.<br /><br />This sauce is also good as a marinade that you can use for any meat as well.<br /><br />Give it a shot. I think you'll be as happy as I am with it!",5
"I bought the 12 pack of Italian roast decaf at the nearby Starbucks store, which I love and go to frequently, for those rare occasions when I want a cup of decaf at night but don't want to brew it.  But this product is not SB's best effort.  First, the packaging isn't well designed.  Tearing the top off at the ""tear here"" line always leaves part of the top intact, making getting the coffee out a chore, and trying to tear off the rest of the sticky top is not worth the effort.  Next, the flavor.  I know Italian is supposed to be bold and bitter, but this stuff takes bitter to a whole new level.  Not good.  Then there's the expiration.  I didn't plan to use this very often, but I'd better, because it expires in less than a month.  What?  Finally, the cost.  At nearly a dollar a cup, this wouldn't be worth it even if it didn't suffer from its other inadequacies.  A definite DO NOT RECOMMEND.",2
"If you like peach teas, this is not the one for you.  The peach flavor is lost and it tastes more like an Oolong tea.  I would recommend the Peach Black Tea by Stash instead.",3
"Finally, an affordable flavored coffee worth drinking.<br />Coffee Bean Direct Hazelnut is a really smooth, medium roast coffee with a definite hazelnut flavor.<br />The flavoring is not sweetened, which is a real plus, especially if you don't like sweeteners in your coffee. (If you do, you have complete control yourself.)<br />The flavor is not overpowering, but is enough to let you know you are drinking a hazelnut coffee.<br />Those who have complained may have received a bad batch. Usually the blend is good and roasting consistant, but, as with any other food product, variations and accidents do happen.<br />I have been using Coffee Bean Direct coffee for about five years and have not yet received a bad batch.<br />This one is a winner.",4
"I was very excited to find this product after experiencing the common problem of the olive juice running out long before the olives. The many positive reviews made buying this a no-brainer. However, once I mixed my first drink it became very apparent  this was not the same brine you will get out of a jar of olives. This olive juice has a very odd taste and has almost a sweet twinge to it. I saw some similar reviews to mine and I wonder if we've all received bad batches. I may contact Dirty Sue directly and see if they'd be willing to send me a replacement. I've made a few drinks hoping I would get used to it but I haven't. I now have 3-1/2 bottle of this stuff that I'll never use.<br /><br />If anyone else is as disappointed as I am, I tried a couple of homemade brine recipes that are FAR superior to this product. Mix 4 cups water, 1/2 cup kosher salt, 1 tbs white vinegar and just refill the jar with this mixture.",2
I generally do not drink the flavored coffee but our recent acquisition of the Keurig coffee maker I have been sampling many flavors.  Of all the 15 - 20 flavored coffees I have tried over the past 3 months the Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle Coffee is BY FAR the BEST.  Fantastic blend of flavors and it actually has flavor...most others I tried seemed to have aroma but fell short in the flavor category.  I highly recommend trying this flavored coffee!,5

"We previously got a few of these at a local pet store to see if our dog liked them. Sure enough, she loved them. They are quite costly compared to other dog treats but they do a good job with keeping her breath ""fresh"" and as previously mentioned, she loves them.",4
"I like the idea behind this product, but the taste was just too sweet for me, and it has a strange aftertaste. While it has no added sugar or corn syrup, there are plenty of calories (135 for an 8.3 ounce can) and carbs. Also, looking at the price, I think it is way too expensive-almost a dollar a can. I would chose flavored seltzer over this any day.",3
"I called Spice Advice at 800-247-5251 and they told me that this Kansas City Steak, Weber (or Tones) Canadian Steak, and Grill Creations - Grill seasoning are all the same.<br /><br />However, if you are not convinced and want to order this under the Kansas City name, you can get it through diversified distributing (the distributor for Tones, Durkee, etc).<br /><br />I cannot verify that these are all the same.  This is just what I was told.",5
"don't follow the direction unless you like watery soup because that is what you'll get. i used coconut milk and added peanut butter to make this ""soup"" tolerable. i didn't fill it to the line, i filled it half way, and that made it a saucy noodle cup instead of a game of find the noodles. not too bad, but not enough food in the cup to make it worth the price...not even close.",2

"I have to say, I've never met a Kashi product that I didn't like. And this bar is no different - great flavor, great texture, good for you! My only complaint is that it's a bit stingy on the chocolate. But then again, what COULDN'T use more chocolate??",4
"After reading how many people were trying these new pop tarts, I had to go buy some.  I bought 4 boxes of them!  And I'm glad I did, because everyone in my family loves them! I am not normally a fan of Pop Tarts, because I find them to be too sweet.  And I was very leary of these, thinking they would also be way too sweet for me to enjoy.  However, upon trying one, I find these flavored pop tarts to be very mild in the sweetness category.  The icing on the top is good and light (I do wish they would not put as much icing on them though!), and the inside tastes just like a pumpkin pie, and believe it or not, isn't that sweet at all!  So you get a pumpkin pie inside and then a little sweet treat on the outside.  My 1yr old loves these things and I can't blame her!  We'll be sad to see them leave when their limited time is over, but will look forward to next year when hopefully they'll return!",4
"This is a nice combination of not too sweet and not too crunchy. I was hoping to find a granola that had a little interest without boring me to death, and one which has some good healthy aspects to it.<br /><br />I love the touch of chocolate...it adds flavor without going overboard and I believe that chocolate is good for you !!! I like it !!",4
"This is a perfect cake!  Gluten free, low starch and high protein, great taste that all my friends love.  Make sure you follow the instructions to a T, all the way down to the adding of 1/4 cup boiling hot water at the end.  If you modify the instruction even a little, the outcome can be disappointing.  It is also a very heavy cake, almost brownie density, which might not be a preference for some people.  I would very much like to find more flavors than just chocolate.  My family is getting tired of having the same cake for every gathering.",4
"Ask a Chinese friend about ""forbidden rice"" (&#31105;&#31859;), unless they are history buff like myself, they will give you a puzzled look.  The term refers to an obscure trade policy during Manchurian dynasty, not an exotic rice.  I will not going to bore you  with history here.<br /><br />The story about emperor depriving commoners of red rice is a hoax made in America, like the legion of fortune cookies. Most fortune cookies are made in a wholesome factory near Atlanta.  We trust that fortune cookies are safe to eat.  ""Forbidden rice?""<br /><br />There is a red rice in China, dark red, close to red bean.  The color varies from gran to gran. Its thick bran provides a pleasant nutty flavor and al dente texture.  The color does not come off easily.  You can get them from Chinese grocery store.<br /><br />What is sold as ""forbidden rice"" at Amazon and Costco has a uniformed black to deep purple color.  It appears to be rice over-milled, dyed, and polished.  Drop a few grains in water, you can see color coming off.  And the color tent to sink to the bottom. That is a easy tell tail.  When cooked, the favor and texture of bran are absent.  If they use red rice, they have milled away its bran to make the rice easy to dye.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with using food coloring.  But is the ink FDA approved?  We do not know.  The label does not say.<br /><br />I am returning mine to Costco.  I will ask Costco to pull it off the shelf.",1
"I expected something really delicious.  I was highly disappointed.  This 'beverage' tastes like stale water, which I suppose it is... I tried mixing in some juice and it did not help - it just made it into a different flavor of putrid. Perhaps, the answer is a sweetened version with some pulp in it - I will give it one more try :)",1

"I ordered this for my husband because I didn't like him using our Zest Deodorant bar soap on his face - thought he could use for a body wash as well. He tried it out but found he had body odor soon after washing.  He tried using his regular bar soap for his under arms after he washed with the liquid soap but had the same results - it must leave a barrier so that any subsequent soap can't be used.  He did use the Dove Men + Care Deep Clean Body Wash to wash his face ONLY* and went back to our Zest Soap (aqua or orange one) for his body.  And, no, he normally does not use underarm deodorant unless we are going somewhere special because he doesn't need it.<br /><br />*Update (11/17/11) My husband no longer uses this at all - he didn't use it after the first week.",2
"I liked the smooth, rather mild flavor of this One Love, One Heart, 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe bean. My only complaint is the single packets with no instructions anywhere.  I assume the packets are for a single cup brewer.  I cut open the packets and used several in a multi cup brewer.  I wish there was a number to call.  Beautiful packaging and an excellent flavor.  Wonder if there's an instant version as well as packaging as beans and ground.  In my limited experience, I think Ethiopian coffee ranks among the very best of natural coffee flavors.  I bet even Bob Marley would like this along with his morning ganga.<br /><br />""...let's get together and feel all right""  Indeed.",4
"Dogs got them as an alternative to beef bones which they are allergic to.  They got right into them, but you must supervise as the knobby ends break off and they are about the size of a large marble so could cause some trouble.  I also noticed they splintered, so they were removed at that point. I like the idea, but the safety issue was a problem.",2

"I drank the water after working out and felt really good, very engergized.  The only issue I have is it doesn't taste like regular water, it has a different flavor.  Not necessarily bad, but not like plain tap or bottled water.  For me, the flavor was too different for me to drink this like regular water.  It was better after I added some ice.",3
"You get what you pay for with chocolate.  I buy Lindt chocolate to serve to guests occasionally, but it's a really poor cheap chocolate.  On a scale of 1-10 (10 being the best) Lindt would rate in the 2-3 range. If you really want a GREAT chocolate that has the full flavor and fine chocolate nuances, you'd have to spend three or four times as much.  I would recommend Amano Artisan Chocolate, for example.  Truly excellent.  Just a warning, however: once you taste a high-end chocolate like Amano, you will never like Lindt again.  In fact, you might just spit it out.",2
"I've always had coconut water from the real coconuts (freshly cut right in front of me), so drinking it from a plastic bottle isn't the same. The taste feels a bit different too, but if you take it out of the bottle and drink in a glass, it doesn't remind you as much that it came from a plastic bottle :)",4
"I advise to take a look at the ingredients in this tea. I believe there are licorice and fennel seeds, among other things.<br /> When I drank it the first time, it was just yucky. The second time, I tried mixing it with black tea and I just couldn't handle it.<br />I have no idea if it helps breathing because I cant get through a cup of it.<br /><br />I will, however, mention that other Yogi teas are great (my favorite is the Vanilla Spice energy).",2
"If you are desperately looking for a replacement to all the kombucha that has been pulled off the grocery store shelves lately, this is not the solution.

"I'm a coconut junkie, so was very excited to try this island coconut flavor.  It is extremely weak.  I use coconut creamer, and if I put in my usual amount of creamer the coffee turns white and has zero coffee flavor.  I'm not really a strong coffee drinker, but I like to be able to taste the coffee AND my creamer.  I'll keep looking for a stronger brew coconut coffee, and finish off this box mixing it half and half with regular coffee.",3
"After making it about halfway through a box of 36 of these pods, I feel qualified in saying I do not like the flavor.  It tastes burnt.  My wife and I have taken to referring to it as ""that cat p___ coffee."" Good price but yuck coffee.  I do like that the pods use less plastic than ""regular"" k-cups, but bad coffee's bad coffee.",2
"When this product became a ""Helper Complete Meal"" instead of just a regular ""Complete Meal"", they reformulated the topping, which used to be a breadcrumb-based parmesan-cheese blend. The new topping is literally just parmesan cheese, and not a lot of it, and the product is notably worse off for it.<br /><br />Overall, the flavor is very mild, not ""Alfredo"" at all, but it is still reasonably tasty and the chicken tastes pretty good. The overall flavor is a generic creamy chicken dish with some hints of cheese. It is, however, a delusion to suggest it feeds 4 - the amount of chicken is enough for 2 (or maybe 2 adults + 1 child).<br /><br />What is there is indeed easy to make, and tastes pretty good for a thing out of a box. If you're just running out of steam but still want something with some 'comfort food' vibe, then this is OK. However, if you're looking for a high-quality meal, look elsewhere. The mexican-style version of this with the rice is much better tastewise, for the same price.",2

"I have been getting the Coffee People Extra Bold Donut Shop K-Cups but I used to buy and enjoy some of the Timothy's coffees too so I thought I'd try this.  Our family are Dunkin Donut coffee fans.  We even fill the my k-cup with preground DD coffee occasionally.  I found the Timothy's Donut Blend to be very bland, almost watery.  I have the Keurig that allows 4 sizes of cups to be brewed.  I usually brew on the 3rd largest size.  I decided to try this coffee with a smaller cup and it was better, but I wish it worked well at the larger sizes.<br /><br />This probably explains the discrepancies in the reviews.  Those who can only brew (or choose to brew) smaller sizes probably like this coffee.<br /><br />Make sure you check the price before you buy.  Click more buying choices to get to Amazon's price which is almost half the price of Liquid Nation's and it is eligible for prime.  Why doesn't that show up as a default?",3
"The pieces are VERY hard.. in fact, too hard for my 12+ year old to eat dry. I have to soak it in some beef or chicken broth in order for him to be able to eat it. I have never purchased grain free dog food, so I don't have any real comparison and it may all be this way. I do however always buy low-fat food. I tried the grain free because my dogs get dry, itchy skin and thought it might help. I have no idea how the taste is, because I don't eat it, but I did try biting into a piece to see how hard it was and it was. My dogs seem to like it as long as it's softened for them though.",3
"I have sensitive skin that is prone to getting dry, particularly during the winter months and dry weather. I thought I would give this new line a try and it was alright. The scent is just right as it is not overpowering but definitely detectable, although I can understand some people being turned off by it.<br /><br />The primary moisturizing ingredient in this body wash is the same as in many others - petrolatum. Those saying that this body wash does not moisturize enough - I would recommend letting the lather set on your body for at least a minute or two. Petrolatum is not an instantaneous moisturizer and needs some time to settle on the skin to do its job. Try aiming the water off of you as you lather and let it set for a couple of minutes. Even with this technique, however, this body wash just isn't as moisturizing as it says, especially in comparison to Dove 'Deep Moisture'.<br /><br />Overall - I liked this body wash. I'm rather picky with my personal hygiene products and Dove For Men passes with an average score.",3
"I ordered these K cups thinking that they were going to satisfy my craving for coffee and come to find out these K cups have done the exact opposite.  I arrived home after a long day at work and saw the box on my doorstep.  I was pretty excited to try these and proceeded to make one.  Not even 2 mins later I hear a ""BOOM"".  Come to find out I walk in the kitchen and see a complete disaster.  Not 1, not 2, not 5, but 10 k cups out of 15 that I made EXPLODED coffee grounds all over my kitchen. I am completely dissatisfied and went right then to buy a drip coffee maker.  I will say though that the coffee was pretty good when it didnt explode but its a gamble to make them knowing that there is a possiblitly of an extra 5 mins work of cleanup to follow about 2/3's of the kcups.  Thanks alot for all the extra work.",2
"I purchased two bottles of Puremiel Organic Orange Blossom Honey by La Tienda. I prefer to buy and use organic productes in hopes of consuming better quality, safer, and more healthy foods for my husband and I. The bottles came packaged very well. I personally did not care for the taste of this honey and would not order it again. That is a personal preference and does not speak to the quality of the product which seems to be fine. I found this honey to be good in quality, mild tasting, but not orange flavored enough for my tastes. I would not recommend this product to a friend.",3

I was intrigued by the combination of coffee and tea, but it didn't meet my expectation. I prefer my coffee a lot stronger and richer. This was pretty weak. That may appeal to some people, though. What I do like about it is that it is organic and fair-trade.",3
"When we first bought these we tried to eat one and couldn't.  Looked at the ingredients and found its mostly pig hearts.  Taste is awful.  Our dog however thinks they are great so we cut them up in small pieces and hide them around for him or forage out by smell.  After about a week the contents of the bag start to mold.  Since they are for the dog, we washed them off and then store in the fridge.  Too bad we had hoped these would be good snacks for football parties etc.  Not recommended for people food.",2
"My wife and I discovered Pierce Bros. as a local coffee roaster.  Now, everything else tastes second rate.  This is the best coffee we've ever had.  Bar none.  You will not be disappointed.",5
"I like everything about this food. The company seems to be pretty outstanding. The ingredients are great. The price WAS just right. The dogs like it. There are just two problems, the price literally jumped like $10 a bag and our dogs aren't digesting this well.<br />We recently moved to a much smaller house with a less secure yard, and as a result the dogs are spending a lot more time with us indoors and we have to walk them everyday twice. I noticed that they were constantly farting and their stool was loose. Honestly, I'm a little disappointed. It took a lot of time and research to find a all around good dog food, but I can't argue with their stomachs.",3
"Growing up on Oreos and milk is common. So I was taken aback with the brand extension of Oreo's to cakesters. And while I had low expectations, I must say these are better than normal Oreos. Although I can't say it'll beat the combo of oreos and milk, these are fantastic treats and relatively guilt-free.  If you like cake and like Oreos you can't go wrong with Oreo cakesters.<br /><br />The filling will bring you back to your childhood while the cake will provide you with a whole new Oreo experience. Certainly worth a try - guaranteed enjoyment!",4
"Vermicelli is a quick cook item that traditionally was only as offered in a white pasta. While the brown rice is not as tasty, for the most part you really can't tell the difference. I tried this product in two separate dishes. Once as an alternative to spaghetti. And the other as part of a Mediterranean rice dish<br />and both came out great! You are getting a lot of product in this package. The downside, sort of, is the instructions says you put the product in room temperature water. That did not work out for me. I had to boil water and cook for about 4-5 minutes to get it to the spaghetti like consistency I wanted to use it for. It's a great healthier alternative to white pasta.",4
"This item was a little pricey for what it was, but it was shipped quickly and was perfect for a last minute birthday gift.",2
"These are actual slices of tuna that can be either a treat or a meal for your cat or dog. As others have mentioned, I too had trouble getting the package open. You are supposed to tear off the top and then open a resealable zip closure. But by the time I got to the tuna, the zip was ruined, so it became a meal for my cats. The tuna was easy to handle and broke up into smaller bite-sized bit without any effort. It also was not as ""fishy"" in smell as you might expect.<br /><br />Did my cats like it? Of Yeah! But the problem is price. $9.99 for a 4 ounce package? You can get 12 Chicken of the Sea 2.5 ounce tuna packages here on Amazon.com for $15.54 and this is tuna you can eat too!<br /><br />If it had a better price point and was easier to open, I would give it a better score. But at this price, you are better off buying tuna from the grocery section of the store.",2
"First, the technical:  It comes in attractive packaging with a good Ziploc seal that actually works.  I really had high hopes for this and give them an A+ for effort.<br /><br />When you open it, however, you clearly realize this has nothing to do with espresso.  There is a super-fine, orange-red dust that comes out almost like smoke and gets all over things.  Next, the texture of the tea is not small flat-like crushed leaves like normal tea, but smallish woody/grassy splinter-shaped material.  It definitely does not tamp like espresso.  Also, being a tea, it does not brew like espresso.  It seems to take about 1-1/2 shots of water to extract the tea.  For a double-shot, this is 3 ounces or more (in 2 passes).  Next, the tea expands into a relatively hard puck more like particle board.  You will have to do some real banging to dislodge it from the portafilter.  I wound up using a fork which furthers the mess.  The fines also got stuck (a bit) in the screen.  Thus, I found the whole ""espresso"" brewing process a bit of a farce.<br /><br />Next, the taste.  It does create a nice crema which is sort of surprising.  The aroma and taste remind me distinctly of Thai tea.  The taste is about 1/2 Thai tea and half wood/sawdust.  I personally did not like it and could only finish about 2/3 of a mug (with steamed milk).  I personally would rather just buy Thai tea which is available from a local Asian store for $2 or $3 a pound and brew it in a standard drip coffee pot.  I think this tastes better, is less mess, and is vastly cheaper.  If you've every used Thai tea, you'll recognize the orange-red spice/dust that tends to get all over.<br /><br />I would have given it 1 star, but my wife absolutely loved it.  Maybe it was the novelty or maybe it was that it was like Thai tea, but she really liked it.  Given the price, though, it might not be an every-day type of tea.  I would recommend that if you are familiar with Thai tea and like the taste, then stick with it.  If not, give this a try.  It's worth a shot just for the experience.",3
"Most of my family truly delights in eating JYOTi saag. It's a delicious and satisfying part of a meal. I'd feel better, however, about feeding JYOTi saag to my family if I had reason to believe that the cans don't leach BPA into the saag.",4

"I have a 15 year old gray short hair kitty who is prone vomiting hairballs. Anyone who has been awakened at night with the sound of a cat throwing up a hairball or has found one staining their nice wood floor in the morning knows how annoying this can be. Not to mention how stressful for the poor cat. The Meow Mix hairball formula seems to help a whole lot with her problem. I've tried giving her a wide variety of other dry food, some supposedly very healthy and expensive, but I always go back to this product because it works. I vary her diet with wet food twice a day and let her nibble on the dry food when she wants. She looks terrific. My other cat is 13 and eats the same diet, she is also very healthy.",5
This bread tastes great because it isn't low carbohydrate it's a very high carbohydrate product that should be in the candy isle.  One slice of this bread made my blood sugar go up 50 points.  I ate two slices the second time and it went up 105 points. It took a while for me to figure out what was causing this dramatic increase. I looked at the label only after I ate it because I still believe in the honesty of our business culture. How can a company sell bread like this when the label is an outright lie? This bread probably has 40 carbs in each slice. I shouldn't have to do my own test on everything I eat. I should be able to trust that what it says on the label is fairly close to the truth. This company should be investigated.,1
"This might be better as an ice cream topping than as a cereal. The nutritional content of this is pretty poor, it's very sweet, and really not all that nutty.  the protein of the nuts doesn't even register in the nutrition. You're better off with Honey Nut Cheerios, IMO.  This is just another spin-off of the other sugared, flake cereals.",2
Coffee was not as sweet as I thought it would be. It doesn't taste bad just not as good as if you just took regular coffee and put ice in it.,4

"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.",1
"I have been using this protein powder for about a month. The first thing I noticed is that this brand mixes better than Optimum Nutrition egg protein, but still not like whey or even rice protein. The texture is not great by itself in my opinion- not awful but not great. I have been mixing Garden of Eating Super Seed with the powder before adding water and it mixes to a much better texture. I've also tried blending the two with ice to make a smoothy which turned out ok. For those of us who can't tolerate the whey or soy proteins, this particular brand is the best I've found.",4
"This makes a very good, low cal. drink.  I have hade one every night for months and will reorder.",4
"Good deal, but a bit weak.  Can't add more water than directed or you'll be drinking coffee-flavored water. Other than that, not bad for decaf.",4
"Of course it's not like the gluten-containing granola, but it's pretty fantastic for gluten free!  I love mixing it with vanilla yogurt.  Tasty snack or breakfast!",5
"The bottle tells you to dispense one squeeze to flavor 8 fl oz of water. Exactly how much is ""one squeeze"" supposed to be? One family member's squeeze colored his whole glass of water orange and gave his water a sticky sweet aftertaste, like several dozen Sweet Tarts had melted into it. My one squeeze left a few peachy tendrils floating in mostly clear water and made it taste like someone who ate Sweet Tarts an hour ago had backwashed into my glass. Neither was pleasant. If there were supplements in the drink and I was getting enough vitamins in the sugary sweet mess to, say, eat another In-N-Out Double Double and not feel as guilty, I'd choke it down. As it is just basically food coloring with flavor, I would not drink this on purpose again.",1
"Thrown into a bag, some were broken, selection was terrible.  Not even 50% were coffee!  Would never purchase again or recommend.  Shame on you!",1
"YummyEarth is probably the best-known brand of all-natural lollipops and hard candies in the US. They don't have a lot of competition, as I found out in my search for naturally-flavored candies. But they do offer a lot of flavors. YummyEarth offers 19 flavors of hard candies, 12 of which are fruit. I was looking for fruit, so I bought this ""family size"" (13 oz) ""Freshest Fruit"" assortment of Organic Candy Drops. It contains approximately 115 hard candies in 8 fruit flavors: watermelon, blueberry, apple, pomegranate, mango, blood orange, strawberry, and cherry. The candies are vegan, gluten-free, all-natural, and certified organic. They are sweetened with organic evaporated sugar cane juice (also known as Sucanat or Florida Crystals), organic tapioca syrup and/or organic rice syrup. Five candies (one serving) contain 70 calories and 17g carbohydrates.<br /><br />The first trick is to figure out which color is which flavor. It doesn't say on the bag, so here's a key:<br /><br />Wet-Face Watermelon: pink<br />Too Berry Blueberry: white/red<br />Sour Apple Tart: chartreuse<br />Pomegranate Pucker: dark red (white writing on wrapper)<br />Mango Tango: yellow/gold<br />Blood Orange Cocktail: red/gold<br />Strawberry Smash: red/pink<br />Very Very Cherry: dark red (blue writing on wrapper)<br /><br />As expected, the natural flavors are a lot better than artificial fruit flavors. Nothing could be worse than artificial strawberry flavor. YummyEarth's strawberry is a little more tart than a real strawberry. Watermelon also tastes of watermelon at first, but there is a second burst that is tart. They still taste good, but there is some room for improvement, as those are both naturally sweet flavors. I was surprised by the blueberry, because I don't like blueberries, but I like this candy. The blood orange and mango tasted to me the most like the fresh fruit. I was especially impressed by the blood orange candies. I expected them to taste like generic orange, but they really taste like blood orange. Mango is very fruity as well. Most of YummyEarth's fruit flavors are available only in big single bags, but this is a good sampler. Something for everyone. I only wish they made a citrus assortment.",5
"When I visit the store the cookies are always whole. I don't live near a Trader Joes so I thought I would try and order them. When I got the product there wasn't a whole cookie in the bag, all crumbs. Very disappointed at 8.00 a bag it wasn't a good deal. I can get them at a store cheaper but my daughter wanted them and so I got them. Not happy at all.... The cookies are good when they are a whole.....",2
"I purchased the vanilla beans from JR Mushrooms and Specialties to make homemade vanilla extract. The beans were in fantastic shape, smelled delicious and were packed correctly to keep fresh.  JR Mushrooms shipped them very fast and have a website with info on different things to use the beans for.  My vanilla extract has turned out AMAZING and in fact I will be making more to give as holiday gifts.",5
"The ingredient list tells the tale: hibiscus flowers, rosehips, blackberry leaves, natural flavor (presumably the vanilla), dried black current (sic) pieces, dried blackberry pieces, dried blueberry pieces, dried raspberry pieces, sunflower lecithin.  This isn't blackberry vanilla tea; this is hibiscus rosehip tea with some added flavoring.<br /><br />The problem is that hibiscus is an acquired taste that I never successfully acquired and do not appreciate here, but lovers of hibiscus and/or rosehip tea should add a star for each love.<br /><br />At least the pyramid shaped teabag works as advertised.",3
I received this item as a gift from my daughter the end of September.  Went on vacation for one month and just now opened up the package to decorate some Jack Skellington cake pops.  The black marker is dried out!!  Will contact the company tomorrow and see if they will replace the black one.  So disappointed and I need them for tomorrow!!,2

"I honestly dont feel any one baby formula brand is significantly better than another.  With that being said, my baby responded much better to the Enfamil Infant than the Similac equivalent.  In fact, we even tried the ""Gas and Fusiness"" Similac and it made him MORE gassy.  After a couple days on Enfamil he was MUCH better.",4
"purchased this item but didn't realize the amount of work to create the liquid tea.  have since purchased the liquid, a little more expensive but don't have the time to make the tea starting from scratch.",3
"This has to be some of the worst tasting tea I have ever tried.  It leaves my tongue with a somewhat raw feeling.  The flavors must be all artificial and not natural,and there really isn't much of any flavor that can be tasted.  If someone handed you a cup of tea it would be pretty hard to tell the flavor.  Don't waste your money on this.  You can get much better tea at Walmart that cost a lot less.  The box the tea comes in is very cheap, and relly isn't worth anything.<br />Jim",1
"I usually do not have much time for shopping grocery, however I really love oyster mushrooms. This dried kind on Amazon is perfect me. It can be stored for a long time, and it taste good. The only thing that I felt a little disappointed is that each bag looks smaller than it is in the picture. But it is okay, as they sent me 12 bags, and each time I only need half bag of them. When you put them in water for an hour, they become surprisingly big though.",5
"I love this coffee!  I am not a strong coffee drinker and this coffee is perfect!  I have no problems with it working in my Cuisinart Keurig Brewer, I aways get the perfect tasting cup of coffee.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because one of the 2 packs contained only 13 K-Cups and not the 24 that it was supposed to have.<br /><br />The decaf 24-count (pack of 2) arrived with the correct amount of K-cups and is as yummy as the high test!",3
"OK so got these not sure what they were like. I'm used to gettting pig ears which are more crunchy. I have two dogs. One just loved these the other wont do much with them. Personally, I dont think I would order them again, but would instead go back to the ears or something a little more crunchy. These are basically like 1/4"" to 1/2"" pieces of skin that have been smoked until cured. Though they are a little crunchy they are more like ummm think of a styrofoam texture.<br /><br />The product was well packaged and I would order from the company again, just would get something different.",3
"I was expecting something with much more flavor given the product description and the many stellar reviews, but this is the worst coffee I've tried since I signed up for the Gevalia club.  Even at Amazon's current significantly reduced price, this simply isn't worth it.",2
This is the same mix that my local coffee house uses in their latte's.  It's full of flavor and worth the price.  The only other Chai mix that  is better is Tastefully Simple's Oh My! Chai mix which is awesome!,5
the chocolate is much better than the regular. i also thought i would be getting four jars because this costs more than buying two not bundled together. because of this i wasted money and am not fully satisfied. product itself is decent,3
I did not care for the taste or texture. I was able to get rid of these by sharing them at  parties.,2
"We've tried a variety of crysallized ginger and find this to be a good, consistent quality at a quite reasonable price.  The individual pieces are sliced lengthwise or on the bias and are not the little 'coins' you get with some other gingers but, for the most part, are tasty and smooth.  There is an occasional stringy piece but not a lot.  Keep in mind that this ginger has a bit of a bite, so be prepared.  Shipping is prompt.",4
"My wife and I really enjoyed the apple and other flavored licorice we bought from street vendors while visiting Oslo, Norway.  However, we haven't been able to find anything like it in the States.

"This is a basic granola mix - granola and chocolate chips. It tastes alright, but is not too exciting. I did like that it was all natural.<br />It can also be used as cereal.",3
The reason why this is 58% less fat and  calories than the regular is because water is the first ingredient..........<br />there is no water at all in the regular Coconut milk and its the same price in the stores. Save your money and buy the<br />regular and add your own water! You will have  watery coconut milk and it will be a lot cheaper!,1
Metromint's spearmint water is by far the best water I've ever had!  It's so refreshing and really keeps you hydrated.  Spearmint is my favorite flavor.  Love this product!!!,5
I purchased this item after my children enjoyed this exact favor + blueberry purchased from Costco. But they said this item sent from Amazon tasted different - not fresh. Now I have four more boxed that I have no idea what to do with.,2
This taste fine. I like some of the other flavors a little better though. What I love the most about this is the price.,3
"I wouldn't feed this to a pet.  Though the nutritional info shows '0 Trans Fats' the ingredients list shows ""Partially Hydrogenated"" oils... that is Trans Fats.  Basically, natural oils that have been modified by attaching two hydrogen molecules where they don't occur in nature.  The end result... the oil is solid a room temperature and creates a crispier product.  The impact to your health is that your system thinks it is oil (fat) and lets it into your blood stream where it is handled like a plastic.  You system doesn't know what to do with it and it is plastered on the walls of your arteries where it stays for a long long time.  Folks... if you care about Type 2 diabetes, cholesterol problems, altheimers disease... maybe more.  Keep these Trans Fats away from yourself and loved ones.  Also this material is hidden in names like ""shortening"" and ""margarine"".  Don't buy this... find a wafer that is safe.",1
"Don't get me wrong, the product is just fine. I was just expecting the ones that come in the single-serving bowls, but these are just plastic bags with the noodles and cheese powder in them. No bowl included.",3
"I found this product priced right, but when it arrived I was not really impressed. At some point in time several of the containers had leaked and dried in the box. I had to soak them in water to get them apart and to clean up the mess. I would never order this on line again. I am not sure I would ever purchase them at all.",2
"I see that some reviewers also noted very weak coffee with these, yet some rave about it. I've only tried one box of the GJ's Hazelnut (won't be ordering more). We've bought other Gloria Jean's which are good, such as the Butter Toffee. So, it may be a quality control issue and you may or may not have good luck w/ Hazelnut. I cannot even detect Hazelnut flavor by taste nor a good hazelnut fragrance as this brews (unusual with flavored coffee k-cups). I've tried various sizes - even the small cup setting doesn't produce a flavorful coffee.",2

"We ordered the Baby Brezza and I was excited to try it out.  We took it out of the box and it wouldn't even turn on.  I was very frustrated and we called the company which was gracious enough to send us out a replacement.  The new one worked very well and I have been using it for about 4 months.  I love the machine it steams very well and I can put a fair amount of food in the container.  I do wish the container was larger because I make large batches of food and then freeze them.  I really like this machine, but now it has started leaking oil at the bottom when it makes the food and drips it into the food when I pour it out.  This I am not happy about at all and cannot feed to my baby with oil in it!  I am going to have replace this product and I don't think I would purchase another one just based off of all the problems we have had now with two machines.  It is a great machine when it works though.",1
"I've had several cats, most of which didn't have much of a hairball problem.  However, the cat I have now, has hocked up some epic hairballs. She's the best cat I've ever had, except for this one nasty problem.<br /><br />So, I bought a small bag of this hairball control from my vet, tried it, and it does seem to have had an effect on my cat's massive hairball problem.  In fact, after about a month of mixing this with her other food, I've noticed that she's only thrown up once or twice, and that's certainly not as much as she did before.<br /><br />I found this bag on Amazon for quite a bit less than what my vet charged, so I'll continue to order it here. Based on what I've observed with my cat so far, I would highly recommend this for those of you who have cats with the same problem.",5
"I've been gluten free for about 10 years now and love my cookies!  I generally order Schar products and love their vanilla sandwich creams which really are as good as or better than gluten cookies.  With Glutino I feel it's hit and miss.  Their crackers are generally delicious and I love their pretzels but these cookies tasted like styrofoam and the icing was super sweet.  Not my favorite product from Glutino.  If you didn't care for these, you might try the Schar vanilla cremes.  They're amazing!",2

It is much easier to make the conventional variety in a pot!",2
I have been buying Garden of Life products for several years now and have tried other coconut oils but still come back to Garden of Life.  Even though it cost more than other brands it still taste the best.,5
I got 4 can for less money at Costco in UT than I did for one can on Amazon. Do more research to find out local prices before you buy online.,2
I'm not a huge flavored coffee fan. Usually I prefer lattes with flavored syrups. A friend sent me a K-Cup to try and the smell was mouth watering before it even finished brewing. The flavor was strong enough to drink it only with milk; I added a little vanilla syrup when I reheated it. I am not a coconut fan but the flavor is barely there. It is just a unique taste for when you're in the mood for something different!,4
"It does everything it claims.  I am very happy with the taste of the product, it was shipped quickly, and it<br />was packed well.  I have no complaints!",5
"This coffee brewed up nicely.  However I love a nice strong cup and found this coffee too weak for me.  If you are looking for a midrange coffee, I would recommend trying this.  By if you are like me and need something stronger, this coffee is not for you.",3
"If you like the taste of Oreos, don't buy this cookie; they taste nothing like an Oreo.

Next time I'll stick with the real deal.",2

I ordered RED roses for Valentin's Day and they sent assorted.  Had two orders and they managed to get both wrong.,1
I have a 65lbs boxer and a 107lbs. olde english bulldogge so I bought the large size.  My chewer the bulldog who I bought the product for popped the treat out in under 2 minutes.  The boxer played with for over an hour.  I HATE that an item over $20 is made in China and with no regulation.  I would not leave my dog alone with this product.  I think it's a great idea but the product could be improved upon.,3
"I rate this a 4 star because of how it tends to have a great quantity of powdery crumbs in the bottom of the bag. The dog will lick it up, but with a powder, he tends to inhale and cough so I end up with unusable powdery crumbs that I can't give to the dog straight from the bag. Overall, this is a great product because it is just chicken and both the dog and the cat love this stuff. I frequently buy the biggest bag and will continue to do so. The good pieces are cubes of chicken, and are dehydrated and crunchy. Since its dry, its easy to handle and give to the dog or cat as a treat.  The bag has a zip closure to keep it fresh.",4
This has made my hair feel great. It smells great and has lasted me a long time. This Balm works great I do use very little each time.,5

"Oberto should be ashamed putting out jerky like this. I am embarrassed calling this ""jerky"". thin, completely flavorless, aside form hints of soy sauce and STALE.  YUCK.  We used to buy a lot of oberto's jerky, though switched to turkey jerky lately....tried this,,,,,,,,,,,and NEVER AGAIN.  This jerky is garbage that even my dog would not dare chew.  Since my family of 6 all eat jerky and ALL have different taste for jerky - we end up buying a lot of different brands/types - but no one liked this one, not even remotely close.  too many other comparably priced jerky brands out there to be wasting money on this junk.",1
"Jjangmyeon is definitely an acquired taste, and half the people who've had it who aren't Asian do not like it.<br /><br />(My roomie threatened to throw up all over the kitchen lol)<br /><br />Still, it is mild and delightful to me. Love it!<br /><br />Also very quick shipping from this seller. Would order again from here.",5
"This is my favorite cake mix to use!  Sometimes I follow the directions on the back, but more often this is what I'll add to the cake mix:  1 cup water, 1 cup mayonnaise, 3 large eggs, and 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract.  It makes it dark and moist, and people NEVER suspect I started with a cake mix.  Even my mother-in-law wanted to know how I got my cake so dark, and she uses cake mixes too (but another, cheaper, brand).<br /><br />Be sure not to mix/beat the batter for too long, as this will make the cake come out with a ""tough"" texture, instead of the tender crumb you get when you mix it just enough to blend the ingredients.  Don't worry about a few little balls of powdered mix in your batter, they will bake out.  If you're really worried about those little balls of powdered mix in your batter, run the cake mix (and *just* the cake mix, no other ingredients!) through a fine wire sieve, or a flour sifter.  This will break up those little clumps.<br /><br />If you love chocolate, this is the cake mix to buy.",5
"I used this for many months a few years ago. By using it I was able to stay off of my biggest vice; sugar. I lost some weight on it, and had more energy while I was using it. However, after months of using it I got where I couldn't stand to drink it any more (I used it by adding it to hot water or tea, as I didn't like it changing the flavor of my foods by putting it in them). Also, after months of using it the odor of coconuts was coming through my skin. I have noticed this with other foods too so it isn`t just the CO: say if I eat raw onions for awhile - or use apple cider vinegar every day - their odor will begin to come through my skin. The odor wasn't such a big deal, but I just hated drinking it any more. And, then when my cholesterol levels went up instead of down, I just quit it. And, over a period of time after stopping it my cholesterol levels came back down. But, then I went back to the sweets and it has again gone high. And, I have gained a lot of weight by eating all those sweets. So, I am going back to EVCO to help me lose some weight and keep off of the sweets. I have been taking in Organic Apple Cider Vinegar regularly - as well as Cayenne Pepper, Turmeric, and Plant Sterols - so maybe that will help keep my cholesterol levels from going high from the EVCO. Hope so...<br /><br />Oh, ironically, before starting the CO so long ago my favorite candy bar was `Mounds'. I totally loved the taste of coconut! But, after doing the CO I got where I almost could gag on it, and it took me a couple of years before I ever ate another `Mounds' bar. I was just totally coconut'd out!<br /><br />Now I will once again be drinking it, but will also use it to replace the omega 6 oil in my oatmeal bran muffins. Maybe I will also experiment this time with using it on vegetables.<br /><br />Even though I quit drinking it I have continued to use it for other purposes:<br /><br />* I use it in the summers as a mosquito repellant. It actually repels mosquitoes (more than) twice as long as 'OFF' (without the chemicals). And, does a more effective job at keeping them away. With 'OFF' some will buzz around, me; not so with CO.<br />* Also, before I go out into the garden I put some under my fingernails, and then dirt doesn't stick under my nails. And, cleanup is a snap.<br />* I have been using it the last few weeks to put in my nose so the CPAP air doesn't dry me out so much, and it is working wonderfully for that. When I first put it in I don't like the smell, but get used to it after the CPAP has run awhile. But, when I pull the CPAP mask off in the mornings the first thing I smell is coconut. But, it is much cheaper and more effective than the gel I was buying for that purpose. The gel was drying up and creating a thick paste up in there, but the CO keeps everything smooth gliding, and it also kills off bacteria etc.<br />* I tried it on my face for awhile, but it caused my acne to flair pretty bad. But, it does wonders for my skin on my legs.<br /><br />I really am hoping that this time I will be able to stick with it, without getting to hating the flavor and odor of coconut again, and hope it doesn't raise my cholesterol levels again: being this time I will be also be using Apple Cider Vinegar, Cayenne, Turmeric, and Plant Sterols to keep my cholesterol levels down. And, the CO can just be a nice `accompaniment` to those things.",3
"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.",5
"Thought I would try Starbucks coffee because I never had it before and wanted to see what all the ""talk"" was about with Starbucks. I just simply did not like it. It was WAY to strong and a little bitter for my taste. I made the mistake of having this right before bed, which no other coffee has bothered me before, this kept me up almost the whole night, so I can't imagine how much caffine is in it. I'm a newbee when it comes to coffee as I just got a Keurig and am trying all different flavor's and blends. Out of all the ones I've tried, I like this one the least. So far, I like Green Mountain the best - all flavors - IMO.",1

I was reluctant to order Jolly Time again and have since tried Quinn's.<br />It's more expensive but worth it.",1
"When my female cat came down w/pancreatitis a few years ago (to the tune of $1000), I started researching what her diet should include.  My vet wanted her on canned food that was low in carbs, but Gracie didn't care for it the prescription brand I was buying at the vet.  Also, I noticed on the can that corn was an ingredient.  I asked her about this, considering corn is a sugary veggie and she also wanted Gracie to lose about 3-4 lbs.  She told me that the main idea was to have her eat a canned food that was 8% or less in carbohydrates IN A DRY STATE.  That means, they take the food, dry it out and get the true percentages of carbs, etc.<br />When I did some research on the web about pancreatitus in cats, I found that GRAIN in cat food can bring on and/or aggravate the condition. I read many articles that explained that cats DON'T NEED grain in their diet.  Pet food manufacturers put it in there because it sounds good to us, the pet owners, when we read that the food contains brown rice, etc.  But what's good for us, as we all know, isn't always good for them.<br /><br />I looked at many companies that made Grain-Free food and was very impressed w/Wellness.  They have many varieties that are grain-free.  When I called them to get the percentage of carbs in a dry matter basis, they were prepared and quick to answer w/out having to transfer me 10 times.<br />The food is not inexpensive, but my cat REALLY likes it.  This bout w/pancreatitis occured about 4 years ago. She has been on Wellness ever since and is in excellent health. She is now 14 yrs old.<br /><br />I highly endorse this product.  If I get another cat someday, I will feed her grain-free food from kittenhood.<br />BTW, they also make grain-free dry food, but I haven't tried it.<br /><br />Good luck!<br />Allie",5

"This is the 3rd conditioner from CLEAR SCALP & HAIR that I have tried recently.  The first one didn't do anything for my hair, the second was an improvement and I continue to use it and this one is even better than that.<br /><br />With this conditioner I have been using it every other day for close to two weeks.  If I use it daily it makes my hair to oily, but on the other schedule it leaves it soft and feeling moisturized.  It rinses well and also doesn't weigh my hair down, which is good for my naturally curly hair.  Additionally I have had less problem with frizziness which is great here in the Northwest. One last note is I do like the smell of it; although because it rinses well it doesn't linger as much on my hair as I would like.<br /><br />Overall for the price I am happy with this conditioner and will continue to use it in a rotation with other conditioners that work well for my hair.",4

"... but it would be desecration to put this gunk on any decent pasta, let alone Rustichella's. Jarred pesto is to freshly-made pesto as instant coffee is to freshly-brewed mocha-java from Peet's. I've been silly enough to try various brands of pesto in jars, and none of them would glean more than two stars. The frozen brands are marginally better, but the only justification for store-shelf pesto is the unavailability of fresh basil, Even then, you'd do better to make a pesto recipe with any soft herb you have: arugula, dandelion, parsley, mashed artichoke ... if I lived in Nunavut I'd probably use lichen from the belly of a caribou rather than depend on jarred pesto.<br /><br />Here's a basic pesto recipe for a small batch:<br /><br />50g of basil leaves<br />Extra virgin olive oil<br />6 Tbsp grated Parmigiano Reggiano or Grana Padano<br />2 Tbsp Pecorino (romano, toscano, sardo or siciliano)<br />2 cloves of garlic<br />1 Tbsp pine nuts<br />Coarse sea salt<br />The traditional method uses a wooden pestle and a marble mortar. Start by pounding the garlic and salt until you get a smooth paste.<br />Add the basil, a handful at a time, and keep grinding until each batch of the leaves is incorporated. To preserve the essential oils in the basil, don't be too rough with it.<br />Add the pine nuts and grind some more.<br />Add the cheese and mix well.<br />Add the oil, little by little, until the pesto has the right consistency - a matter of taste.<br />Serve with pasta or added to minestrone. The recommended pastas are troffie, trofiette or trenette, but it goes with just about any pasta. I usually serve it with spaghetti or linguine.<br /><br />If somebody has an interesting variation, post it as a comment.",2
"this review is coming from a person who enjoys coffee more than the average morning coffee drinker. I requested a Keurig machine for Christmas. I thought single serve would be better than it is. I like the concept of a diverse coffee selection just for you, when you want it.

Not a good experience for me. keurig has discussed on their site that they are working on an alternate packaging that would also be recyclable. Until then I'll make it in the pot.",2

"Don't get me wrong, these are good tasting peanuts. And we love Chile y Limon peanuts and we buy them all the time at retail stores.

We've tried many brands and I can honestly say these are the most hot and<br />salty of all. So, if that's to your taste, you will be a happy camper with these.<br /><br />One other minor point: the packages are huge, but the peanuts settled to about a third of the package. We think there<br />are actually 6.5 oz of peanuts there, but it's disconcerting to see all 6 with so much package and so little peanuts.",3
"The Rendang Curry from Prima Taste is an easy to make and tasty dish.  Unfortunately, it is not the healthiest.  But I don't mind eating a little fat sometimes, and we did enjoy the taste.  Additionally, it was easy to make witch makes it very convenient.<br /><br />We added beef as the directions say, but also some onion, bell peppers, and garlic.  The addition of the vegetables not only adds some nutrition, but also adds to taste and makes the product go farther.  We ate it over rice.  Please note, as I stated above, the paste is primarily fat with some sugar and spices.  It is not healthy at all.  The meat, added vegetables and rice provide more nutrition and allow you to eat less of the paste/sauce, thus reducing the percentage of fat calories compared to the total calories consumed.  (80 of the 110 calories per two tablespoons come from fat)<br /><br />The price is a bit high, considering you have to add other things to it, but it is not outrageous.  I just think those that are budget minded may choose alternate curry pastes that are less expensive.<br /><br />Over all, I give it four stars because we really did like the taste and it was very easy to make.  I took one star off because it is not very healthy and the price is a bit high.  For an Asian (Singapore) treat once in a while when you also want a quick dinner, it is a tasty meal.",4

For some odd reason (possibly because tons of people in the U.S. have a mild to severe problem with being overweight) they decided it was a good idea to subtract most of the sugar in these drinks and leave us with a near flavorless, almost diet-like drink to suit the kids better. Was this a good idea? Maybe health-wise yes, but not if you actually want to enjoy one of these. What the hell happened? These drinks used to be good! Now all I can say is that I will only reach into the fridge for one of these when there is nothing but water and cranberry juice available!

What is in the bag however is cassia, the fake cinnamon the FDA has approved for use in the US. I am so disappointed. If you use the cinnamon found at your local grocery store, this is a great deal. But if you know the difference, then you know that the two are NOT interchangeable and THIS WILL NEVER DO! Cassia is hot, harsh and intense while canela/ceylon is rich in flavor but mild and sweet.<br /><br />Ceylon resembles a cigar from the side, many layers and is light brown in color. You can eat straight from the bag. Cassia comes as flatish squares or is a single layer rolled into what resembles binoculars from the side.<br /><br />If you want true mexican/ceylon, use this link or cut and paste into your browser.

"I mainly use my Keurig for coffee but thought I'd try this one since I love dark chocolate and it was getting mostly good reviews.  I've tried some other chocolate K-cups and had given up on them since they all seemed pretty watery.  If I can taste water I don't consider it real hot chocolate.  I was pleasantly surprised that this tastes much better than the others I've tried.  (I must admit there are many I haven't tried, but I don't really feel like making a big scientific study of it.)  This will be my source of hot chocolate from now on.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed to see how many ingredients it contains.  That sort of thing worries me a little.  Still, I don't drink hot chocolate that much, so I think I'll survive.  I'll copy the ingredient label here for those concerned plus a few items from the nutrition info:<br /><br />Calories 60, from fat 20.  Trans Fat 0g. Sodium 200mg. Sugars 6g.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: sugar, glucose syrup solids, cocoa (processed with alkali), partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (may contain coconut, soybean, sunflower, palm and/or canola), modified whey, maltodextrin, salt, natural and artificial flavors, cellulose gum, sodium caseinate, cornstarch, lactose, dipotassium phosphate, sucralose, mono- and diglycerides, silicon dioxide, soy lecithin, artificial color. [Contains milk and soy.]<br /><br />(I always hate seeing artificial coloring in ""dark"" chocolate products.)<br /><br />If I had hot chocolate every day I would consider making it from scratch with more cocoa and fewer chemicals, but since I enjoy the convenience of having it nearly instantly from my Keurig on the occasional whim, I'll just keep a box of these K-cups on hand.  I highly recommend it for the taste, it isn't easy finding good hot chocolate.",5
"I love dark chocolate, so I was excited to try this Newman's Own Dark Chocolate bar.  First, I was impressed that the bar, which is smaller than other specialty chocolate bars but still a generous six squares, is just a single serving size.  At 330 calories, 22 grams of fat, and 28 grams of sugar, it is still an indulgent treat, but if you choose to share the bar (as I did), you can satisfy your sweet tooth without feeling too guilty about it.<br /><br />I definitely enjoyed the taste of this bar as well; I found the chocolate to be rich and smooth.  At 54% cocoa, it is definitely not as dark as many other dark chocolate offerings out there--in fact, I found the taste to be a bit sweeter, more reminiscent of semi-sweet chocolate than true dark chocolate.  Although this was fine by me, some dark chocolate lovers may be disappointed.  So, unless you need your dark chocolate to be of the extra-dark variety, I would definitely recommend this product.",5

"I really enjoy a coffee package that is so inviting and has socially uplifting things to say. The coffee inside was good, as well.<br /><br />However, to break it down -- it was one of the smoothest coffees I've ever had, like drinking silk.

I do feel there are others, though, who would appreciate a coffee lite.",3

"The review by ""Small Stuffed Monkey"" appeared just a few days after I placed my order for this tea...too late to cancel my order.  When I read it, I was hoping his critical comments would prove to be simply wrong, or at least too harsh.  But in fact they are right on target.  First, he is correct that the tea itself does not look at all like the image on the webpage (it doesn't consist of what looks like rolled leaves, but rather is in tiny flakes).  Most importantly, he is right about the flavor.  There is practically none; and the flavor that is there is stale, dull.  It is the most insipid green tea I have ever drunk (and I have drunk many kinds, from China, Japan, Sri Lanka, etc.); but in light of the off-putting nature of the flavor, I was actually glad there was not more of it.  This tea might, in light of its price, look like a bargain; instead, it is exactly the opposite...a complete waste of money.",1

The Dental Chews perform a good service in that regard.<br /><br />I recommend the product!<br /><br />I rate ""Zoe Anti-Oxidant 8-1/2-Ounce Dental Chew Bones, Medium""...Four stars!",4
"My husband and I agree that this brew is really ordinary. If you don't like espresso, or strong coffee, this blend if for you! It reminds me of the coffee I used to drink before finding Lavazza, an Italian coffee we've drunk since 2007 when we came home from France with memories of that divine espresso. Now, we've gotten lazy and enjoy the Starbucks VIA italian roast instant coffee--the key to our appreciation being the strong but NOT BITTER flavor.",3
"Bought these from another vendor, as I was craving licorice. I love licorice, all kinds, and I couldn't even eat more than a taste of this. I threw it away it was so unpleasant.",1
This tea tastes great! I was worried because it is made with sencha green tea which I don't usually like but it is delicious...recommended! Good price for pack of 3 and shipped fast:),5
"Yuck, they really messed it up when they changed the recipe. These taste like solid molasses bars, hardly any licorice flavor at all!!!",1
"For the price you can get a much better tasting veggie broth/powder: Seitenbacher Vegetable Broth + Rapunzel Pure Organic Veggie Broth (higher salt content than  Seitenbacher but you need smaller amounts to acheive similar effect. So, it all balances out at the end?). Also, if you're cooking anything with mushrooms & you want to keep the mushroom theme, use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E2B8"">Savory Choice Liquid Reduced Sodium Vegetable Broth Concentrate, 4.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br />I cooked with Pacific and size of pks are not convenient at all. It all depends on the portions you're cooking; which makes powder option (the above recommended ones) much more convenient.",2
"My girlfriend loves Red Bull so I bought this 24 pack as a gift (She was actually really excited about them). It's not much of a deal here, the only deal is/was that I did not have to go out and get them at a store.",4
"Pad thai is the first thing I order at any thai restaurant. It varies depending on the restaurant, but I've always know it to have a tangy peanut sauce that's slightly sweet.<br /><br />However, these noodles just don't taste anything like any of the pad thai dishes I've had. It's also just not very good. The first thing I noticed upon opening the noodles packet was the unnatural smell it emitted. I tasted the noodles plain, and they were very noticeably sour with another unnatural note (detergent... perhaps). I know I did not get an expired package because every Annie Chun's bowl I've had was just like this. And they were all a year or two from expiration.<br /><br />I thought it might get better when I blended in the flavorings, but it didn't improve. Very sour, as if the noodles were seasoned primarily with vinegar. I gobbled them up because I was very hungry at the time, but they were not all that good. They're not very unpleasant, but they could be much better. Though, one nice thing about these is that they're very generous on the noodles, so they fill you up (they left me very satisfied even though I had been famished when I was making them).<br /><br />You also might want to consider that they have strong green onions. My boyfriend had to admit to me (trying not to sound harsh) that they made my breath smell of onions hours afterwards. We're close enough that we don't get embarrassed by things like that, but you that you might not want to have this in the office.",2
Received my order in a couple days.  The bamboo stalks were packaged well and were in good shape.  I was worried about ordering plants but was happy with how they arrived.  Would definitely order them again.,4
Don't buy these.  I have a very large German Shepherd and cut a piece for him when he had trouble eating it.  I tried soaking one but it still retained its very hard texture.  I'm afraid of this product and think a dog can choke on it. It's inedible and I will never buy it again.,1
"I bought this product thinking that the onion powder is a granulated powder, but it is actually a fine powder, which I usually don't use while cooking.  This is a very good product if you are looking for a fine powder, but not if you are looking for a granulated powder.  It has good flavor, and I have used it in cooking, but it isn't so great to sprinkle on pizzas and pasta.",3
"My Son was put on this by a Pediatric GI Doctor because the other formulas were making him constipated and his poop very acidic. She just said that the water should only be luke-warm otherwise the probiotics are killed and never put a mixed bottle in the microwave--this also will kill the good bacteria. I nuke the water for about 20 seconds, mix well, stick my clean finger into the water--if it is the same temperature as my hand--I mix in the formula, mix well and feed my son. His GI issues are getting better and we're very happy. I just recommend talking to a Specialist before playing with a bunch of different formulas. My son was in pain off and on for 8+ weeks due to our Pediatrician just guessing.",5
Sadly i got really excited when i saw this and the toy these go into that i bought a few flavors and the toy ASAP. She isnt into them =[ hopefully she comes around and starts to use it but we will see. If she does i will make an update!,2
"I am sorry, but this is not authentic Dutch licorice. The original Dutch Licorice, known in Holland as 'Drop', is made with Arabic Gum. However, Gustaf's is made with Wheat Starch instead, probably because it is much cheaper. That does affect the taste, as Wheat starch has a more sticky pasty texture, where Arabic Gum has a firmer and  smoother texture.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is by far the best 'Drop' I have found so far that is readily available in the USA for a decent price. Importing the real stuff can get quite expensive. So, I will be buying this again.",3
"I was very disappointed by the product.  They are NOT long lasting as I was lead to believe.  I was going to buy Chewlotta's which take my dog about 2 hrs to go through 1, but I thought it was too pricey at $3 a pop.  My dog could eat this whole bag in less than 2 hours.  He does enjoy them though.",2
"Received this e-mail back from the seller after contacting Amazon customer service. Tea was shaken loose all over inside of package, the tins were very tiny and instead of Dragonwell and Pu Erh, I got 2 Oolong, 2 Black and 2 Green Tea.  I assumed one of the two greens was the Dragonwell but nothing was labelled Pu Erh...in English that is, and Pu Erh was why I bought the assortment.<br /><br />From seller<br />""Hi, we are sorry that you are not happy with the tea. However, Pu Erh (in Chinese) Tea is inside, it is labeled as Yunnan Tea.<br /><br />Since  the tea was not made by us, it is by the local Chinese people, whose English translation is not as good as it should be.  Sorry about it.<br />However, the Pu Erh is definitely inside.<br /><br />We have authorized the Amazon to give you the full refund , and we would appreciate you to have a kinder feedback""<br /><br />Cannot recommend this seller.",2
"This has to be the worst coffee I have ever had the chance to drink.  My daughter summed it up in a simple statement , ""It was like licking an ashtray.""  I agree.  Bad coffee.  Bad purchase.  As another reviewer said, no savings is worth bad coffee.",1
"I usually don't care for freeze dried fruit, but these are in a class by themselves.  They are cored and PEALED, and melt in your mouth delicious.  The same company makes the same product in separately decorated bags.  Mickey Mouse Clubhouse for Kids and Crisps for adults.  They are the exact same product, so if one is unavailable, you can purchase the other.  My favorite is Apple.  If you do purchase these, buy them through Amazon, as they sell them cheaper than the grocery store. These are really yummy and good for you too.  I am a grandmother, and this wonderful treat was introduced to me by my grand daughter.",5
"This should even be called Yakisoba, I've had real yakisoba and it isn't.  It not only taste like yakisoba, it taste terrible.  If I could give it a zero I would.  They don't even sell this in japan!",1
Good product that keeps you regular -- isn't that what all those grains are supposed to do?  The taste of the sunflower seeds can be a bit over-powering times.  Good hot or cold. Enjoyable if you like lots of grain in the morning.,4
"We seen a show on TV where this type of rice was mentioned. I found it on Amazon and bought 1 bag to give it a try and have been purchasing it ever since. Although a bit pricey for rice, being how different the flavor is we use it for special meals only. Wish though it was offered in 5lb bags instead of the 2lb'ers.",5
"I had to fight to open the sweet potato chip bag because my mind just doesn't want me to be eating sweet potato chips.  Anyway...I get the bag open and I expected them to be gross.  The chips are not gross. They taste like sweet potatos which to me means they need some butter flavor added  to make them taste good.  As it stands, they taste like an unflavored bake potatoe without any butter.<br /><br />I tried to eat a whole bag and they kept getting stuck in my teeth so I gave up.  Also, it just doesn't feel right to be eating sweet potato chips.  I have a whole box of them so I am going to continue to try to get used to them.<br />====<br /><br />Update: I still have a box of these chips left.  I couldn't stomach them, my co-workers said they were too bland, and my friend co-worker said they taste like unflavored cornflakes.<br /><br />I don't see how these will be a hit in stores.",3
"I have been eating this stuff since the '70s or shall I say HAD been. They now only have the New and Improved Recipe which is terrible!  I thought it went bad-- then I see on the box, new and improved. Who approved this. Anyone remember New Coke--- well, I see this happening again only with Quaker, Inc.  I will no longer buy this stuff until they go back to the old recipe.",1
"Because of the Newman's Own brand reputation and that most of the ingredients are organic, many people may be fooled into thinking this product is healthy to eat.<br /><br />This is *candy*.<br /><br />Okay, now that I've hopefully made it clear that this is not a healthy product to be eating. It does make an enjoyable snack!  The flavor is good and the nutritional profile is not terrible. Enjoying a few of these now and then may be a nice break from an otherwise healthy diet (You are eating healthy right?).<br /><br />The soft chewy texture and nice mild flavor is very enjoyable.<br /><br />I like these, but I wouldn't make a habit out of eating them.",3
A little disappointed that I received 6 boxes of these noodles on<br /><br />9.10.2010 & they expire 12.7.2010. I wish I was informed beforehand of<br /><br />the expiration date. =(,1
I don't eat Gluten so I am always looking for good Gluten Free snacks. Most are  like sawdust -- These taste better than regular pretzels.  I highly recommend them.,5
"Two of the six packages were beginning to mold, but not even close to the expiration date.  One other package was visibly torn.  I was curious to see if any of the packs were still sealed air-tight, so I placed them in water. Five of the packs were exposed to air with small opening around the seal.  I imagine that they burst somewhere in their travels from changes in altitude/pressure.  I cannot vouch for the actually taste of the product as I did not eat them.  The silver lining: Amazon has GREAT customer service.",1
"I have a one year old lab/pit bull mix who will chew up a 10"" rawhide in a day.  We've purchased two of these 24"" rawhide's and they each lasted about a month.",5
Waste of money...tasted like metal (which I was prepared for but not in such abundance). Its expensive...I will stick to regular water. HORRIBLE!!,1
"While I agree this is shipped in a nice wooden box that can be used for other things and the fish has an excellent flavor, I was surprised to find it was not what I expected.  I expected smoked lox salmon like you find at a good deli or grocery store, not fully cooked salmon as this actually is.  For those expecting the latter, this is a great product, however this is not for me as it was smoked (or cooked) too long.",2
"My wife and I have been going through the different brands of Xylitol gums/mints/products for the past 2 years.  We decided to try the Xlear Spry stuff because it was cheaper.  Boy can you tell that it's cheaper.  While it does the job of delivering Xylitol, it fails at the part of being a ""gum"".  It's hard, and gets harder after a few minutes.  I think the longest I was able to ""chew"" the Spry stuff was 5 minutes, then it became so hard that it was decidedly uncomfortable to chew.  On top of that, after a few minutes it actually started to dry our mouths, and it has a weird (and not pleasant) taste at that point too.<br /><br />It's bad enough that we knew within a few weeks that the price difference was Well worth it.  After all our testing, Xyloburst seems to be the clear winner in terms of best quality for the price.  It stays soft/chewable for as long as you want to chew, it never drys the mouth and the aftertaste is markedly less, and takes a lot longer to appear.",2
"I like these pitted prunes for breakfast in the morning, they are good with cereal and are high in fiber. I have always liked SunMaid products and I  like these prunes.",4
"If you are a diabetic and have ever attended a nutrition class for diabetics you probably have heard of this product. We have a whole collection of the different flavors and I have posted a photo of some of the ones we use the most. This is an ideal additive to diabetic cooking, baking of foods or the mixing of drinks. It is sugar free and calorie free and extremely low in sodium.<br /><br />These mixes are ideal for use in coffee, tea drinks, Italian sodas, cocktails, pancakes, waffles, diabetic cakes, over shaved ice and muffins. You can find a lot of diabetic recipes and substitute these flavorings for ingredients that have more sugar and calories. The result is surprisingly good and it will help reduce your sugar and calorie intake while helping you add more flavor to your food.<br /><br />This flavor is good for adding to creamed coffee to get the taste of Irish Cream without the added calories, sugar or alcohol.  Real Bailey's Irish Cream has 7.4 Grams of sugar, 136 mg or 45% of your daily cholesterol, 33 mg of salt and 7.4 grams of carbohydrates.  This product adds no calories, no sugar, no carbohydrates and no cholesterol to your coffee.<br /><br />It jazzes up the flavor without adding calories or a lot of salt. It only contains 5 mg of salt. I have attached a photo of the label for your review. You can add more flavoring to suit your taste.<br /><br />Flavorings like these are nice to spice up your low calorie drinks and food and the Da Vinci Gourmet brand is the best we have found. They are internationally recognized as the highest quality flavoring made and one tablespoon = a free food exchange for a diabetic.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this to you as a great product!",5
"I bought this after reading Opinunated's review of Sambal Oelek.  In their review they listed ingredients from label but failed to list all ingredients.  I thought I had finally found a chili paste that didn't have a bunch of preservatives.  Unfortunately Sambal Oelek has a couple.  Here is the entire ingredient list:  ""Chili, Salt, Distilled Vinegar, Potassium Sorbate and Sodium Bisulite as preservatives and Xanthan Gum.  CONTAINS SULPHITE (Sodium bisulfite)"".",3
"I bought Acana Wild Prairie for Dogs almost two months ago, having used Acana's Grasslands with great success for my 9-year-old Maltese.<br />  I received Wild Prairie from Whole Healthy Pet within two days -- much earlier than expected -- and their customer service turns out to be excellent.<br />  However, my Maltese began licking her paws the day she started eating Wild Prairie. Since it was fall, and I wasn't sure but what mold or leaf mold or grasses could have contributed to her sudden allergy, I worked on eliminating her exposure to everything else that could be causing it. But she continued to lick her paws.<br />  So I ordered Acana's Grasslands, again sent from Whole Healthy Pet, and, as before, it arrived immediately. Within two days of switching back to Grasslands, her paw-licking ceased.<br />  Acana has a great product line -- and I will continue to use Acana's Grasslands, and Whole Healthy Pet -- but about 10 pounds of the 15.4 pounds of Wild Prairie has been given to a neighbor with a non-allergic dog.",5
"This is pretty darn good coffee, although I should mention that I'm not an expert and I'm not overly picky. What I do know is that it tastes great and works superbly in our Breville espresso machine. I've found that I hit that 9 bar ""sweet spot"" almost every time with this coffee, and it consistently produces a thick, rich, fantastic espresso.<br /><br />Coffee fanatics might want to go with something higher end (and higher cost). But for me, this has been about the best of the $10ish per lb coffees, and it's what my roommates usually ask me to get more of.",5
"I've tried several kinds of fruit and nut bars, and these are my least favorite.  Mostly dried fruit (which is rather intensely sweet)with a few nuts which have been encased in the bars long enough to lose their crunch.  I wouldn't reorder and will probably try to coerce the grandkids into eating this box.",3
Tea was very good with a mild hint of mango.  Rather expensive compared to other brands.  Also made iced tea with the tea bags and it was very refreshing.  The Passionfruit with the Mango is a great combination,3
"I was hopeful.  Higher fiber, lower carbs, lower calories, and I like brown rice.  Sadly, it's a bit tough and tastes like cardboard.",2
"King Oscar and Bumble Bee sardines are both packed in Poland. Bumble Bee is the distributor for K.O., and I believe both brands come from the Mediterranean instead of the icy Nordic waters. K.O. 3.75 oz tin costs $3.79 retail and B.B. cost $1.69 where I shop.",2
Bought these for my God-daughters birthday party. The lollipops are cute but they lacked taste. Some of the children licked them and then tossed them.,1
I am very pleased with this tea. I have given 4 stars only because I felt that the peppermint flavor should be a little stronger.,4
This is the best Gluten Free Bread mix we have tried.  The only improvement would be a version with seeds and more texture to simulate the multi grain breads we miss.,4
I have very severe food allergies and when I found Erewhon Corn Flakes at Whole Foods 7 years ago I was thrilled to read the label. Two ingredients! Imagine my surprise when I tried them and realized that they also tasted great! This is literally the only cereal I can eat and I don't mind at all. I've been a loyal consumer for seven years and will continue to be. Ordering them through Amazon 6 boxes at a time is so convenient. No more 50 minute trips to WFM!,5
"I tried these because I love Kellogg's Fiber Plus bars, which taste much better than the General Mills Fiber One. What a mistake. These do NOT taste good. In fact, they're quite disgusting. The after taste lasts a long time. You'll be tasting these for hours after drinking one.<br /><br />They're filled with fiber, protein and vitamins but it's also filled with sugar and pretty high in calories. I ran out of Visalus so that's why I picked these up at a local store. I will not make that mistake again. Visalus is about 2x the benefit, about the same price (per day), lower in calories, lower in sugar, and tastes a million times better.<br /><br />I don't drink these to lose weight. I use them for nutrition. Regardless of why you want to drink a protein shake, I suggest staying far away from these. Visalus literally tastes like vanilla cake mix. This tastes like a garbage bag.",1
"These are quite tasty--soy sauce flavored but not too salty, which is misleading since it does contain plenty of salt( you probably shouldn't finish all of the soup, for health reasons).  Another problem with these instant ramen is the lack of an expiration date on the package---I ordered Myojo's yakisoba along w/ this and had to throw most of it away.",4
"My dog is in love with this dog food. She won't even touch her other kind any longer. There are some ingredients that I'm not thrilled about on the ingredients list, but there's not much I can do about that when almost all kinds of dog food have these ingredients. The biggest thing a dog food should be is edible to a dog and my dog loves this and as I can see from other reviews, there are tons of other dogs that love it, too. If you have a picky eater, you should try this food. My dog goes straight for it, the same way she would a treat.",5
"Pros: not overly sweet like some juice drinks<br />  no caffeine<br />  no corn sweeteners (if that matters to you)<br />Cons:  expensive for the size (8.3 ounces)<br />  can't taste the orange or tangerine juices in it<br />  lots of calories<br /><br />I grew up eating oranges and tangerines off my grandparents' trees.  I was surprised that I couldn't taste those flavors in this drink, but then I looked at the ingredient list on the can and those were the juices that were used in the smallest amounts - probably to keep the cost down.<br /><br />I'll stick to the Sobe low-cal drinks and the 10 calorie Vitamin Water because 1 - they are cheaper and  2 - I'd rather save up my daily allotment of calories for something with more flavor.",2
"This David's Signature ""Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler"" contains an eclectic mix of delicious jelly beans. These flavors are from David Klein, the creator of the famous ""Jelly Belly"" jelly beans, so I was thrilled to be offered this sampler to review since my family loves jelly beans. Here are my opinions of the included flavors, in order of my favorites:<br /><br />* Coconut - Very strong natural coconut flavor, my favorite one<br />* Vanilla Bean - Very good tasting, natural vanilla flavor<br />* Pomegranate - Totally nailed this one! So good!<br />* Ginger - Crisp natural ginger flavor, every bit as good as the fresh ginger candy we get locally<br />* Cranberry - Really very good and natural tasting<br />* Root Beer - Amazing, can almost feel the fizz!<br />* Green Apple - So good! Very natural apple flavor!<br />* Peach - Very good juicy peach flavor<br />* Strawberry - Very good, reminds me of strawberry and cream<br />* Lemon - A little milder than expected, very good ""clean"" flavor<br />* Black Cherry - Very natural tasting but a tad bit over sweet<br />* Grape - Great grape flavor, not quite as strong as expected<br />* Orange Punch - Good flavor, not overpowering<br />* Blueberry - Good, but somewhat understated<br />* Himalayan Sea Salt - Very odd choice for a jelly bean, but it is a surprisingly enjoyable flavor<br />* Bacon - Does indeed taste like sweet smokey bacon, a fun novelty flavor but not one I'm going to eat all the time<br /><br />My list of favorites differs a little in order from other members of my family, as might be expected since everyone has different tastes, but every one of these rates higher than any other manufacturers similar jelly bean flavor we have tried. Combining some of these flavors is also fun with ginger and lemon being my favorite, producing a very clean and refreshing sensation.<br /><br />I also really like that these jelly beans are made with 100% natural flavors and colors, and includes an impressive list of fruit concentrates fairly high up in ingredients list.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH",5
THESE ARE FOR MY FOUR CATS THEY JUST GO WILD FOR THEM ALL I HAVE TO DO IS JUST SHAKE THE BAG AND ALL FOUR COME RUNNING,5
"Bought these to try with our new eating life style and they have proven to be a great little addition. The flavor is super, the blue corn is a favorite and brings its own unique flavor to our dishes. This will be a repeat buy.",4
"This product is great if you like the particular spices used in the mix.  Unfortunately, although I am drinking it, I am not enjoying it as the flavors just don't jive with my palate.  If you really like the spice combination (I like cinnamon, for example, in almost everything, but in the chocolate mix it just doesn't make it for me), you'll love it.  I guess my advice is the product is fine if you like the flavor combination, but I would advise trying the mix in a small packet to determine whether or not it's for you.  I have this huge quantity to consume, and I rarely partake of it as I don't really care much for it.",3
"Received this order promptly, but am very disappointed in it.  Over half of the k cups have exploded in our Keurig.  When this happens it makes a huge mess.  The machine has to be totally cleaned each time.  It appears that the seal at the top of the kcups is not properly attached.  The ones that do survive make excellent tasting coffee, but I will not reorder them online again.  Very disappointed, makes some of the best tasting coffee we have tried, but only got to drink a little of it.",2
Beans arrived and were promptly ground and brewed. Upon tasting I noticed the coffee was a fair bit weaker than I remember when visiting Sant'Eustachio in Rome. 3/4 through the can of beans I flipped over the can and noticed the date. 2007. Wow. Talk about super expired out dated beans.<br /><br />Given the other reviewers postings -- I'd give up and just buy beans from somewhere else. It won't be the same but won't be as disappointing as these ones.,2
I found the Harry Potter Chocolate overpriced and too small. I found out too late that you can buy them at stores such as Iparty for alot cheaper and not have to pay the very expensive delivery charge. How much could they weigh anyway?,2
"I'm giving this product 2 stars because the label says that 4 teaspoons of the stuff is enough to enjoy the taste. However, all 4 teaspoons did was produce brown potty water. I had to dump nearly half of the container into my cup just to get any flavor at all and I only had a small coffee cup full of water it's not like I expected 4 teaspoons to flavor a giant mug. Don't waste your money, buy a better brand.",2
"Actually they were not real goose liver,they are pork liver pate.Of course goose liver is more expensive!Taste's OK for me though delivery fee is too high!Unacceptable because they're from NY(inside US);",3
"Why in the world would Amazon want to sell an item and say can be ingested,  when it clearly has ingredients that can cause cancer. Wish every state would wake up like California and ban all these cancer causing things.",2
I got this almond butter to use in some raw food snack recipes. It worked very well mixing with other ingredients and tastes great on its own. I will definitely be buying more to use in future raw recipes.,5
The vanilla beans must be the only vanilla flavoring in the bottle.  It's more like grain alcohol with coloring and a little smell.,1
"My girlfriend loves aged gouda and I'm a fan too. I bought this as part of her Valentine's Day present, but I think I eat just as much of it as she does. She thanks me profusely every time she breaks it out and has some (so long as she doesn't notice I've been nibbling). It is so rich and flavorful that if you like gouda at all, you owe it to yourself to try this at least once.<br /><br />P.S. The [...] service was excellent as well, truly a pleasure!",5
"I actually like this tea, but I did give it three stars for a couple of reasons. The tea, in my opinion, is average... nothing really to set it apart... three stars is average... The tea is not organic, no really high points, no really bad points... again... average. The biggest negative for me is the price... at the supermarket they usually have sales on tea that would make this a lot cheaper if bought there.",3
eating these was sort of like eating a salted air bubble.  It was great for snacking because it takes a while to eat one package but they really tasted like salty air.  I am not sure I really liked them at all.,2
"I supposed as a treat, this would do better than its dog food. But I was wrong when I received and tried it today. My dog does not like it at all. This treat feels like cookies and very dry. I got a small dog (Yorkshire). I don't know if big dog will find it delicious or not. Just my own experience.",2
"I ususally buy Genisoy tortilla chips, but can't seem to locate them in-stock anywhere. So I decided to try the Kay's chips, because they are high protein also. They are good, but very pricey. I don't think I'll buy them again-  just didn't think they were worth the cost. I hope I can find the Genisoy chips soon.",3
"I like my coffee strong and normally use the large cup size on my keurig, if I want an espresso type use the small cup size",4
"We have to say, great taste, and a wake up in the morning. Due to our commute each morning we are limited during the work week on how much coffee we can consume before leaving the house during rush hour.  This coffee provides a rich taste, and is not bitter.  If you love the taste of coffee and a quick wake up this coffee is for you.",5
"I love this stuff-I think it tastes great! And I even grew up in Japan in a Japanese household with a Japanese mother who makes much better miso soup but since my mom doesn't live nearby, this is the perfect substitute for me. Don't tell my mom-she'd be horrified! I gave it 4 stars because I wish there was more tofu in it. Also I only use about 1/3 to 1/2 cup boiling water instead of 2/3 cup.",4
"I purchased this product hoping that the ""bullet proof like material"" would last longer than the other toys I'd purchased for my 8 month old lab. He's a chewer, and within an hour had the rubber-rope gnawed in two. But someone posted a photo of the modification they made post-rope that saved the day: inserting a tennis ball into the bottle. AMAZING IDEA! Whom ever came up with that should write the company and suggest the modification. He can't get through the bottle, and the ball blocks the hole enough to where he really has to try to get the treat out. It is loud, but this is the first toy to survive my lab. If it's lab proof, I'm sure it can survive anything!",4
"This is one of the best products I have purchased from the Ginger People. The juice is concentrated and can be used in recipes or in tea, which is why I purchased it. I love it and have given it to friends as gifts. The convenience of the small five ounce bottles makes it ideal for travel. It is good for colds, indigestion and it taste great. It is well worth the purchase price.",5
"I love cinnamon sticks and have bought from many different venders. I boil or pressure cook them to make a big batch of tea. Some give up amazing flavor: sweet, spicy and oh so good. These were weak and woody and were among the worse I have ever bought. I don't mind spending the big bucks but it had better be the best quality. These sticks sucked. Maybe I was unlucky and got a bad patch. But obviously quality control is not good so I don't be buying anything from Frontier again.",1
Overall i like it though it is little bit too sweet for me. I know there are other cereals out there with even more sugar. The nutty flavor comes from peanuts. I would prefer something like almonds. The fiber content is good. The sweetness is probably not to make it taste like cardboards.,4
"The company is great.  The candy was great.  I got it as part of a ""remember when"" Christmas gift.  As a kid it seemed more powerful. Now, it's just candy.",4
"We have four smallish house type dogs that rule the roost here, so we thought we'd try this new bacon flavored Lickety Stik product on each of them. Reviews were mixed. A couple of them sniffed a lot, but didn't seem to want to partake. The other two licked gingerly, and would continue to do so as long as we squeezed the plastic bottle, but they didn't seem overly enthusiastic. It seemed to take a lot to squeeze the brown goo out onto the plastic head, actually, and it tended to drip off too much at times before they could lap it up. I think it also was bothersome that the plastic bottle looks a lot like a roller-ball underarm deodorant dispenser. Rather bizarre in a way. One of our sons is always teased about liking bacon so much, so at the latest family night supper he was asked if he wanted some Lickety Stick for his underarms. Everyone laughed. Except the dogs. They were trying to do a serious analysis and review. Anyway, maybe some dogs will like this stuff, but our family voted against buying more for our dogs. It was an interesting experiment, and your mileage may vary.",2
I don't drink coffee but I got it for my Husband.  He said it is pretty good.  We just got the Hazelnut in which he likes much better.  I love the price!,4
"These markers work okay, I wish the tip was a little softer. For writing on the candy coating if you press too hard the candy clogs the pen, so if the pen was a little softer tipped it might help, because you could use less pressure,but worked as expected.",3
Stuff was great! Used it in lip balm that I created for x-mas presents. Will be ordering this stuff again!,5
"This review pertains to the Dark Chocolate Truffle flavor of Gevalia's ground coffee.<br /><br />Having subscribed to Gevalia's service at one point in the past, I wasn't expecting to like this coffee very much since I previously found Gevalia's coffee to be much less rich than I like.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that I enjoy the flavor of this coffee quite a lot, however, precisely because of its mix of mellowness on top of the chocolate flavor.  I'm not normally a big fan of flavored coffees and generally prefer an extremely strong cup of brew (for drip coffees, typically a French or Italian roast), but this was a nice change of pace.<br /><br />My only real complaint involves the packaging.  Gevalia still seals its packages into little bricks that leave no way to close them once they've been opened.  Since the foil is so tight, opening the bag requires cutting it.  Once the bag is cut, you either need to leave the top of the bag open until you've finished the coffee inside or transfer the coffee into a different container.  Why Gevalia does not use bags that can be folded bag down and semi-sealed after each use (like every other premium coffee brand) is a mystery to me.",4
Really enjoy these...  and they don't make you feel too guilty.  Easily satisfies cravings for dessert.,4
"I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though.",3
"This would be a rare treat & be a very unique one if this were dried coca leaves but this is just a small bag of cocoa (unrefined chocolate)with a bit of processed chocolate . It is not like eating a candy bar nor is it like chugging instant coffee from the container but a little of both. In fact there are a few chocolate chips(whoopee)thrown in. This was found under coca leaf tea but it is not, this is actually unprocessed chocolate.The shipping is excessive-$4.99. I hope helped.",2
"This is a great product.  Although I'd initially planned to buy a single box to sample the product, I realized after reading previous reviews that coconut water was probably an acquired taste, so I bought a 12-pack just to see if I'd end up liking it.  At first, I was disappointed; the first taste seemed rather bland (and it was somewhat warm).  The next day, I drank another carton (cold now) and it wasn't too bad.  The third day I found myself looking forward to getting home to drink a carton of this stuff!  Now, I love it so much I've subscribed to regular deliveries.  For me, the mango flavor is the best.  I wish it were a little cheaper (thus only 4 stars) but otherwise I like the product just the way it is and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a lightly flavored alternative to sodas.",4
"This stuff taste the worse, no sweetner helps and it stinks up the place...Stay away from this stuff, what a waste of money.",1
Apples and strawberries were crunchy and satisfying.  Pears were chewy and suspect as we were expecting crunchy.. Support from company was ok as they replaced however replacement pears still soft.,2
I ordered the escargots in January and thought I had ordered two cans and when they arrived I had twelve cans.  I kept them and am really glad that I did.  We have already used several of them.  They are very good and so easy to fix for a quick appetizer.  I rate these a 4 1/2 out of 5.,4
"The title for this product should not include 'Meal' but 'Snack' instead.  The combination of salmon and crackers, dried edamame, dried fruit, and chocolate toffee doesn't seem like much of a meal but several snacks put together.  Regardless, that makes for a great lunch/snack while on the go.  My kids did some taste testing with me and really enjoyed the edamame (we did live in Japan though, so this was familiar to them), dried fruit and nuts, the crackers without salmon, and of course the chocolate.  I was worried the salmon would be too strong but it just had a hint of lime and chili.  A knife would have been nice to have to spread the salmon.  Overall I thought this would make a good snack for the kids and I in between outings or at the park.  Lots of fiber and a healthier options that a lot of products out there.",4
"My brother and I have an ongoing dispute about what is best to feed dogs.  I maintain, quality in will result in fewer illnesses and vet bills. My dogs usually eat Innova or Fromm.I rarely go to the vet for anything other than wellnes visits and shots. He thinks that the cheapest is fine. His dogs always have ear infections and are a bit on the pudgy side.<br /><br />Enter Beneful.  My brother thinks it is a high quality food brimming with meat and vegetables.  I was not so sure.  If you look at the bag, it would seem he was right but the ingredient list tells another story.  The primary ingredients are ground yellow corn, chicken by product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour and beef tallow.  Yes there is some real beef and much further down the list are carrots and peas. Not exactly the appetizing mix pictured on the bag.<br /><br />The kibble itself has a pleasing appearance.  With no discernible odor, it comes in a variety of shapes colors and textures.  The dogs love it, which is probably not a resounding endorsement as one of them will reguarly clean the cats litterbox if you are not careful.  But in fairness, they do gobble it with great enthusiasm and even try to open the bag to get seconds.<br /><br />The bag is one of the best things about this food.  It has a plastic slide zip which not only works smoothly but keeps the food fresh and safe from maruading pooches.  It is bright and colorful and the 15.5 pound size  is easy to handle.<br /><br />I guess in someways it is like letting your kids go to McDonald's.  An occasional meal won't kill them, but it is not good for everyday.  I will go back to my expensive premiums and use the remaining kibble as training bits.  My brother however, thinks it is great because all the dogs dive into it with unbridled enthusiasm and it is significantly less expensive.  For what it is worth I have a one year old Geraman shepherd and two 3 year old Chinese Cresteds.  He has a 6 year old shepherd, an 18 yr old schnoodle and a three year old chow mix.<br /><br />If you are concerned with convenience the packaging makes this product ideal.  However if you are seeking a high quality food for your pet, I would look elsewhere.",3
"The first time I ordered coffee, it was fresh and sealed tight. Second order the coffee wasn't as fresh. Good price though for bulk",4
"Purchased this item because the product description and the image both showed the product as a 6.6 pound bag, not a 3.3 pound bag. $18 is pretty ridiculous for just 3.3 pounds of this specific cat food. Will buy larger, cheaper back from local distributor next time.",1
"This product is only sweetened oatmeal with varying amounts of blueberries, but there is absolutely NO GRANOLA in any of the the 4 boxes I've eaten so far.  So when the box says Granola, read oatmeal and six dried blueberries.  It tastes fine for what it is, just know that it is not granola (like the box says it is).",2
"I use this coconut oil for cooking, face cream and as a nutritional supplement.<br />The quality is extraordinary! Once you try this you will not want any other coconut oil.",5
"In general, I found my son did not like the taste of Prosobee formula and we switched back to similac sensitive. I did not like this product because it comes in cans, versus the plastic-like simlac bottles",3
"When I opened the package, the entire bottle was spilled and dried all over the inside.  I can't review this item however, I can say i have tried all the other MIO flavors and love them.  I would assume this would be the same.<br />sorry !",3
In stores you can by this pack for less than five dollars. 2 dollars on sale!<br />Compare to normal price you are paying twice more and to sale price 5 times more + shipping.<br />Way overpriced.<br />Do not fool your self...,1
"There are other treats that my dogs would do anything for...  but I'm too busy to make them boiled chicken bits all the time. And I can't feed them bits of last nights steak since my poor minature pinscher is allergic to everthing.<br /><br />But with Zukes... he avoids wheat, corn, beef, milk, oats, all other sneaky grains/fillers/etc and he only gets the good stuff that he deserves and that his poor skin/coat can handle!<br /><br />And don't get me wrong... they will do plenty to get these little bites of good stuff, which is great because when I do have fresh meat for them to eat they tend to get too excited trying to get at it to hold a sit for long enough to deserve a treat!",4
"The problem with most pretzels is that they are white-flour bombs.  Lots of carbohydrate and not much else (other than a ton of salt).  Consequently, I have been looking for a good whole-grain pretzel.  These are pretty good.  The multiple grains add a variety and depth of flavor not found in plain pretzels, and you sure don't miss the extra salt.  Although they have a crunch, they are not so hard that my wife won't eat them.  They have only three flaws.  First, they are slightly sweet.  Although it is a subtle sweetness (which I suppose some folks like), I could do without it.  Second, white flour remains the number one ingredient, notwithstanding the multiplicity of whole grains.  Third, although they are low fat, they are not fat-free.  I am not sure why the bakers find it necessary to add oil to a pretzel.  Despite these shortcomings, these are a good--and healthier--alternative to standard prtezels, and much, much healthier than most other salty snacks.",4
"I love, love these Good Health Kettle style olive oil potato chips with sea salt.  They are crunchy, but not as greasy as the Kettle Brand chips that I also love.  They have just the right amount of sea salt.  I normally do not eat potato chips except once or twice a year in very limited amounts.  I ordered them for my grand children, but ended up eating most of them myself.  So good.",5
I remember eating Shake 'N Bake when I was a kid. I think I even got the privilege of shaking the ole Ziploc baggie. I recently tried the Original Chicken flavor. I think the individual serving packs are great size. I even tried this on Tilapia tonight and it was pretty good. It's a great alternative to fried foods. I like that it is a really quick and easy meal solution. It takes less than 30 minutes from start to finish.,3
"I based my purchase entirely upon user feedback.  It may be the packaging (non-hermetic) that is impacting the taste, but this product was simply bland.  I reviewed the ingredients and is is reconstituted.  Perhaps coconut looses flavor during the dehydration process.  Nonetheless, I will struggle through the remaining 10 bottles and cancel my Amazon subscription for it.  Off to the next brand...",2
"Hard to call this a potato chip it is so different from the average chip. Different in very good ways. First the spiced variety tastes great. They are thick, satsifying, spices work very well with the sweet potato flavor, and the taste combination makes it seem like it was just made and fresh out of the oven.<br /><br />They also stay fresh...forever. I had an open bag at work without a bag clip and the chips were still good after a couple of weeks. Satisfying probably a lot more good stuff for you than regular potato chips. Great break from potato chips, very highly recommended.",4
"Just receive the noodle and try one.  The package looks similar but not the same as the one that I got from the Korean market.  I just finish the box of Shin noodle that I bought from Korean town so I know the differences right away.  I thought I got a good deal and save a trip to Korean town.  Guess not, I am wrong.  I am going to the Korean town this weekend to get the real stuff.  A little disappointed, I really want my authentic spicy red Korean Shin instant noodle tonight...<br /><br />This Shin noodle is made in the USA and it is a American version of the very popular Korean instant noodle.  This American version is only one-third as spicy and the noodle get soft and mushy very fast like the regular instant noodle.  The dry vegetable package does not go soft even after 10 minutes.  To use the dry vegs in the future, need to soak it for at least 30 minutes so the dry mushroom will get soft. The spice package is orange color, the real Korean Shin noodle is bright red in color and the noodle will not get mushy after 10 minutes.  I think it is something to do with the red pepper that the Korean use and not the picante in this USA version.  It is spicy but taste totally different than the Korean kind of red pepper which make it so special.<br /><br />Really want to return it but since I got it with the lightning deal discount, I will eat it like regular instant noodle to save the hazzle.  So beware if anyone reading this is Korean or have tried the real Korean Shin instant noodle.  This is not the real thing, do not order this and do not pay full price for this American version of the Shin noodle.  Before I was skeptical when reading some of the reviews with only 1 star, now I know they are right.",1
This tea is amazing! i love the taste and smell of it. I average anywhere from 3-5 cups of this stuff a day and cant get enough! plus the price is insane. a definite buy for the jasmine tea lover.,5

"We have been buying Caribou Blend K-cups for a couple of years. It is a fine medium blend that we, and everyone that we have served it to, loves. We usually order it in larger quantities to try and save some money since we go through it fairly quickly. The last order we placed for 2 x 80 boxes was fulfilled with the K-cups with green color labels (the older labels were orange around the edges). The taste of this new k-cup can only be described as vile and has nothing to do with the former product. It is not drinkable. We have written to Caribou and have been waiting for a response, but nothing yet (I will update if I hear anything). DO NOT BUY this product if you have used the older product with he orange color on the label and liked it. You will not get the same thing and this coffee is truly terrible!<br /><br />Deserves 0 Stars...<br /><br />Update - a note from Caribou Corporate:<br /><br />Thank you for taking the time to contact us.<br /><br />We certainly apologize for any confusion. Recently the packaging for Caribou Blend K Cups did change. Previously the regular blend had an orange band and the decaf had a green band. The new labels the regular is a green band and the decaf is an orange band.<br /><br />The coffee itself has not changed, simply the label. There are two factors that might be involved in the change you taste. The change in taste is affected by the time that has lapsed between roasting the coffee beans and brewing them...freshness. Also, coffee is an agricultural crop that varies with weather and other environmental factors. Our Roastmasters put in a lot of time and attention to provide a consistency when roasting the coffee beans.<br /><br />We do apologize for any confusion and please let us know if there is anything else we can do for you.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Linda<br /><br />Caribou Coffee Customer Relations<br /><br />The coffee is Dramatically different, but they will not admit to the change. Oh, well. Goodbye Caribou Coffee.",1
"Gloria Jean's is a definate favorite around our house.  It is difficult to find it for the price on Amazon and assured delivery.  I am pleased recommend such a wonderful, tasty coffee treat!",5
"Of course the object of this cereal is to be a mushlike consistency and it delivers.  It is delicious as is.  I usually make a 'batch' in the evening and let it sit overnight, we then have it for a few days as I find it is better as the milk absorbs.  The first time I had muesli was buffet style in a hotel overseas.  The setup was tremendous!  All types of fruit platters were at our disposal as was a bowl of yogurt and nuts.  We were encouraged to add to our delight so that is also how I often now eat it when time allows, adding a few spoonfuls of yogurt and with additions of extra raisins or craisins and cut up fruits.  While this may not be the traditional method, it provides variety, after all, all of us living in this household still have our teeth and healthy consitiutions (knock on wood) and are not in the state that this cereal was first designed to help.  I love that it is authentic and have been eating it for years as it is delicious and nutritious.",5
"I personally love all the goods and commodities from Amazon --  most of the time, they're on par or above expectations, and when they're not, you can always return them without big hassle. This pack of prunes, however, is a nightmare. I had it in the morning, and haven't been without a stomach pain since. My advice is to stay away from it. Well, unless you've had it before and loved it without any issues.",1
"These have potential to be great, if not for the leaks.  The bag is well designed and lays flat to store which is all good, but we have had 1 out of 3 leak, usually around where the ziplock ends. Not sure if we got a bad batch, but having to throw away 1 out of every 3 makes this a much more expensive product, not to mention the spilled milk.",2
"I was very disappointed in this coffee product. When I use it as directed, the coffee looks like weak tea. Tastes like hot water.",1
The roller ball was sort of hard to get going. My dogs kept biting the bottle and wouldn't lick it very much. It also had a very strong smell.,3
"This thing is huge! I got it for my fiance's birthday, and although i knew it would be big, i really was surprised with how big it really was. The hight and thickness is similar to a 2 liter bottle of soda. He loved it and thought it was the best thing ever! We all took a bite and it tasted just like the original small pinapple gummy bears. Its such a great gag gift and a great price to pay for all the smiles you will get!",5

"I originally fell in love with both the Wicked Wolf and Bruin blends, but I have been let down by this as well as the Resurrection blend. It is rather light for a dark roast, tasting much lighter than an everyday Dunkin' Donuts Dark blend, nearing a medium roast.<br /><br />The coffee does have a nice even roast, and a bit of oil coating the beans. Nearly perfect for a medium roast blend, which this is not.<br /><br />The flavor is not offensive nor amazing. It is coffee and nothing more. I would be hard pressed to discern this from any other run of the mill medium roast.<br /><br />With my last couple of experiences I will not be purchasing Raven's Brew again.",3
"i tried golean crunch as part of kashi's free sample gimmick--i'll assume that the quality is the same as the store-bought!... anyway, i rate it highly on taste, as it reminds me a little bit of the honey smacks i used to eat, only not so overly sweet. and its health factor is pretty fantastic too (for me, some things taste better when you know they're good for you, although usually it's the opposite!) but the texture, well, they don't call it crunch for nothing--it was a little too crunchy for me. in some bites, the crystallized honey or whatever was like rock candy, and rock solid. still, it's good stuff, but i'll take one of kashi's crunch bars over this any day.",3
"I suppose if you like this or not just depends on your taste buds... I am vegan, and I haven't had chicken in a long time... and this was still terrible! I couldn't stand the smell, and I couldn't stomach swollowing the few bites I tried. My tip would be, try ONE can of this first and see if you like it. Don't make the same mistake I did in buying a whole case, just to find out that it doesn't agree with you!!",1
"I used to think that all popcorn was the same.  However, I've been buying an eight-pound container of Orville Redenbacher's popcorn from Costco for awhile, so I have another brand to compare with the Paragon popcorn while my memory is fresh.  Paragon is less expensive than Orville Redenbacher's, but the texture and flavor of Orville's product are significantly better than Paragon's.  While Orville's has almost a buttery flavor even without seasoning, Paragon's has much less flavor.  While Orville's texture is marshmallow soft, Paragon's is much crunchier and less enjoyable to chew, almost as if the kernel hasn't completely popped.  Both brands seem to have the same rate of kernels popping, i.e., pretty much all of them pop in my air popper.<br /><br />So I've learned that you do get what you pay for with popcorn.  It isn't that Paragon's product is bad, and in fact I've purchased it before and enjoyed it; I just didn't have Orville to compare it with at the time.  Although I'm generally quite frugal with my purchases, after I've popped my 12.5 pounds of Paragon popcorn I'll be stocking up with Orville's again; it's worth the extra money.<br /><br />I've come back to downgrade my rating from three stars to two, because after eating this popcorn for a few weeks I'm realizing that I'm just not looking forward to the experience the way I used to.  It's just too crunchy, and too much of the popcorn is husk.",2
"""The Red One"", organic baby food ""smoothie""<br /><br />If you're like me, you're interested in this item because it looks convenient and like something your baby will actually eat -- that would be a pretty good description of this product, with a few caveats:<br /><br />-The nutrition content of this product is not really that great.  We tend to mix this in with rice cereal for some iron, but otherwise it's a bit of a waste on its own.<br />-The taste is good, but maybe a little sweet for baby.<br />-The packaging is great -- very portable, screw top cap.  You tend not to waste much product with the packaging design.<br /><br />Just a reminder, the container is a bit smaller than some of the other ""bagged"" baby foods:  3 oz is less than the plastic Gerber containers (at 3.5 oz), but more than the small glass jar foods (usually 2.5 oz).",3
"i like organic, however, i am looking into what the product's ""natural flavors"" are listed in the ingredients as that will make a difference in whether or not i continue to purchase the product.  i've tried many natural coconut waters and this one does taste sweet to me.",4
"I know this may sound off, but I love Indian food, but I don't like spicy hot food.  More often than not, when I buy prepared Indian food like this, they are very spicy hot.  I think this is done to compensate for a lack of real flavor.  But this paste has a really nice flavor.  I can still make a better curry myself, but when I don't have the time these are great.  Plan on trying the other flavors.",4
By far the best flavored coffee for the Keurig.  Not particularly strong...use the 7oz setting...but very nice.,5
I bought a 6 bar pack of these fig bars last week at out local Wal-Mart for $2.50.  I was surprised how at good they are! I am on Weight Watchers and they work well with the program.  I thought ordering on Amazon might be cheaper but I was wrong.  I'll be going back to Wal-Mart to get more soon.,4
"This stuff tasted like cough syrup, but actually tasted kind-of good if you don't use too much.

That SUCRALOSE stuff is used in all the ""vitamin"" drinks now, but really...it's not good for you.<br /><br />Your better off pop-in a high-dosage multi-vitamin and drink plain water...",2
"We enjoyed this coffee very much, smooth and rich taste gets us off to a good start in the morning! I'll be purchasing this brand often.",4
"This product is more applesauce than anything, as another reviewer wrote. I specifically ordered the berry hoping for some actual berries. The product came out looking yellowish, like apples. I am wondering how many berries actually made it into the product.<br /><br />That said, it's good tasting and it's good for you. It's organic puree and it is very convenient. But, as the other reviewer noted, the product that is named after a little rabbit is far superior in its mixture of fruit and consistency.",3
"The taste is great,  but it is so thick, you can't pour it,  and can't get it off of the spoon.  So it is not useful for trying to make chocolate milk,  and it is a pain to use as a syrup for ice cream.  This is much more like a fudge consistency.  Would not  buy again.",2

I was in a hurry and did not read the reviews...I trusted amazon's description and it did NOT indicate it was flavored coffee and that it was NOT Jamaican...it is very lightly flavored with vanilla so it isnt too bad. I feel cheated.,1
"This stuff is disgusting, and very misleading.  What a waste I'll probably have to throw it away if I can't give it away!",1
"I hate it when manufacturers chose to use misleading terms and try making the product more desirable than it actually is.<br />Yes, Natural it is, but not really when its got added 'natural' unneeded crap. Can't stand when some live-and-eat-by-manufacturer americans who couldn't care less or are ignorant upvote an unhealthy product.

It's great to be able to order Altoids Spearmints on line because they are often hard to find in stores and they're my favorite.  The price is better than locally too.  I would have given this company 5 stars but they sent me the wrong product.  They  were very good at correcting the problem in a timely fashion.  I'll be ordering again!,5
"I had seen these on a TV show,they ate them on the show and made them seem pretty tasty.  I wont buy again, they are like eating sawdust!  I had to drink so much water to get them down.  I did find that if you put cream cheese on them its a lot better but I would rather eat my fiber bars, even my daughter likes those.",2
"I could't finish the first cookie I tried. It just tasted overly processed and chemical-laced. Ick. But I am giving the cookies two stars since my husband ate most of the package before I threw it away. When asked, he didn't really like them but he didn't find them as repulsive as I did, obviously. He didn't complain when I threw the rest away however. I wouldn't buy these even on sale and in desperation for a cookie. I can handle a regular Chips Ahoy or Keebler at times but these were just gross to me from appearance to consistency to taste which was the ultimate condemnation.",2
Best tasting energy bar that's healthy and all natural too. I recommend eating them early in the day or before a workout because their a little high in sugar(15grams). Eat 2 of them before a workout and get plenty of energy and protein to help mend those ripped muscles!,5
"This powder is delicious. I use it in protein smoothies, protein bars, and sprinkled over fruit. Used as an ingredient, I find it much less messy than regular PB. My only complaint is that, if used in a recipe...the jar doesn't last as long as originally anticipated (due to the powdered nature).",4
I don't think this is a good deal. The box is tiny and I think I will go back to sams club.,1
"I love Pop Chips and had been odering the variety pack.  However, there were some flavors in the variety pack that I didn't particularly care for, so I decided to branch out.  This is my first time trying this flavor.  While okay, they are not as good as I had originally thought.  I'm working my way through them, but will probably not order this flavor in the future.",3
I am considering this Turkish Delight box as good but not fantastic. The box has several different flavours and some of them were too strong to me. I enjoyed and finished the boxes and I also gave this as a gift to my friends and they all were happy with it.,4
...this is not the healthiest choice BUT a yummy treat at less than 15 bucks. I must admit I succumbed to the Gold Box Special... NO I didn't look for the nutritional information; truthfully I didn't care!,4
"As stated elsewhere it takes a day or two to get going, and it does smell but it did not smell as bad as we were prepared for it to. It has lasted all of a week and has caught thousands. I have to throw it out as there is no room for flys to go into the bag.<br /><br />My only recommendation is if you have a lot of flys go for the quart(M380) or gallon(M383) product that is reusable and can be re-baited.",4
"My Tulsi arrived, and happy to share it, I opened it up to share with friends. What a disaster! Not only did the Tulsi contain a few bugs, it is not ""pure"" Tulsi. Though it lists three types of Tulsi, it appears to contain other elements.<br /><br />The bugs also indicate that it was not stored properly. I will be getting my tea elsewhere!",1
These were a gift for someone out of town.  I suspect they were perfect or I would have heard otherwise.,5
This toy is not so good if the treats or kibble is too big.....  even small kibbles have a hard time getting out of the jug.  I think this toy needs to be re-designed----My dog kept trying to pick up the jug from it's base so he can tip it up side down but the jug was too big to be picked up and made of slippery plastic (he's a Newfoundland with a big mouth).  He learned how to dump the food out with empty soda bottles that I would put kibble in.  It took a long time for him to get his food out and then at the end when there was only a little left he didn't want to play anymore because they would not come out.  I think I will either take the rope out or drill a small hole at the tid of the jug to make it more fun.,3
"I saw a bottle of this at my local grocer. I love jalapenos and seeing a red jalapeno sauce made it a must buy.<br /><br />The sauce was not what I expected, I was expecting a thin vinegary kind of Mexican hot sauce. This sauce is much thicker than that, but not as thick as ketchup. It is a bit tangy with a balance of sweet and heat. The label says ""Very Hot"", but it will only seem this way to those who are more sensitive to heat than the average spicy food fan.<br /><br />After my first taste the first thing that came to mind was hot wings. They have the perfect tangy/sweet/hot sort of flavor profile, along with a consistency that lends itself very well to sticking to wings (both cooked and raw). It is also thick enough to be brushed on wings while they are being cooked on a grill. I began to wonder if the brand name was called ""Bufalo"" because it was intended to be used for wings, but after some research I found out that the company name precedes Buffalo Wings by quite a long time, the name is pure coincidence.<br /><br />As a wing sauce this stuff is a welcome addition. It is a very slight change from your standard hot wing flavor, being made with Jalapenos, while still very true to the flavor you expect from hot wings. As a hot sauce on its own it is good but each time I try it on something else I keep coming back to how much this tastes like a wing sauce.<br /><br />I recommend giving this stuff a try to see what you think. Definitely try it on your next set of wings. My next bottle will be the larger sized bottle because I plan to make some more wings with this stuff.",4
"FYI: The ""Natural flavors"" claimed on the container appear to be ""dust"" and ""all-purpose flour,"" and they completely overpower anything you add it to. The serving size (in order to achieve the nutrition it offers on its label) is 3 scoops, not 1 as it claims on this page. But it doesn't matter if you choose to add 3 scoops or 1 scoop, or whether you add it to skim milk or juice - as the container recommends - the powder will never ""mix"" with any liquid. It just floats on top and clumps together in little flour-like balls, which may be pleasing to a starving person in Ethiopia, but not so much to someone who has the option of eating real food instead of this junk.",1
"I liked the packaging and the idea behind the company- which was why I decided to try it out- but it's more a case of style over substance.<br /><br />The aroma is enticing, but that's where the magic ends.  The taste was bitter and a little acidic; even experimenting with different flavored creamers didn't completely mask it.  Which was a shame because I really wanted to like it.  It's not bad if you're into bitter coffees, but since it's billed as being made with ""exotic floral and berry beans"" I can't really recommend it too much.",3
Tastes funky - I only tasted it once and threw the rest away. I've had much better.,2
"My daughter was not a big fan of baby food, especially any with proteins, but she did LOVE this one! The flavor is just right, not too sweet or too savory, and doesn't have a strong chicken flavor. Almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp, thus it's a very good first protein to offer, and good for picky eaters. My nephews and my niece also liked this flavor, so it's a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you don't know a particular baby's preferences.<br />Something I wish I had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other Stage 2 Earth's Best, especially for having chicken. I added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture, and she liked that just fine, but it is an extra step. However the runnier texture makes it workable for younger babies or those with gagging/texture problems.",4
"I must say that I bought this for two reasons. One, because the price was right and second, because it had CHOCOLATE. I actually liked this one better than others except it is no Cafe Mocha. What can I say, I'm going to search now for a Cafe Mocha here on Amazon. If the price is right i'll buy it.",4
Great toy! A little big but she loves it! Purchase if you have a big dog who loves to chew and tear things up!,4
"My dog seemed to love these when I got samples at the vet after her teeth cleaning. But then I bought an entire bag and she was over it, ha. I do really like the C.E.T. products since I have a small dog with bad teeth!! One caveat, they have this strong vitamin-like smell that lingers for a while. Suppose that is better smelling than those bully sticks!",3
A box of this coffee contains 15 packets. There are no preparation instructions so one would think that one packet means one cup. Since coffee makers consider a cup to be 6 ounces that was my starting point. One of the reviews mentioned that the coffee is weak so I doubled down on the amount. This meant two coffee packets in 6 ounces of water. While the coffee was brewing it emitted a very slight and barely detectable odor. When the brewing was finished it was time to drink coffee.<br /><br />This is by far the weakest coffee I have ever tasted. It would take all 15 packets to make  one 8 cup pot of weak coffee at a cost of over ten bucks. Not a good choice. There are far better coffees available at far more reasonable prices. They would be a much better choice than this Marley.,2
Sickenly sweet and artificial tasting. I'm getting rid of this box by mixing it with a regular K cup.I would not ever buy it again.,1
My dog Ellie is allergic to chicken so I have to be very careful what she eats.  These are perfect for her.  I give her the venison and the beef.  They are soft so they do not upset her digestive system.  Most importantly she loves them so they make a great training treat.,5
Great product at a great price.  These bars are great snacks in between meals. Healthier substiture without the bland taste of most health foods.,4
"Very tasty for about 1 minute and then you have to spit it out because it is flavorless and has a poor texture. This is the shortest lasting gum I have ever tried and frankly, it is a waste of your monely",1
"I used this product and did not have any bowel movement. I was using this in conjunction with ""The Master Cleanse"" diet and maybe the best option would have been to use an actual laxative but still....this product did nothing for me. Then again, all of our bodies are different and this may work better for you than it did for me.",2
"I love The regular Peanut Butter powder and was very excited to see this new product available. Unfortunately, these cookies had a very strong ammonia taste to them.  I'm sorry, but I cannot recommend them.",2
"I know now why this vanilla sugar was so much less money then most, the vanilla beans are not ground. There are two, whole beans in the container and if you want them ground, guess who does it? You will need a very fine spice grater, luckily I had one. I will probably need to buy even more beans because I like the vanilla flavor intense! I was quite dissapointed. :(",2
"I don't know about ya'll; but I work in an office and right between 2:00 -3:30, I experience an almost daily crash.  Really sleepy and lethargic, no focus.  This stuff usually does the trick.  One minute you're falling out of your chair, the next, you're good to go.  Alert and focused.  It's been a lifesaver more than once.  I'm also going to school online, and it has saved my bacon there, as well. I get the 12 pack and keep some at home and some in my drawer at work.  For me, its effect is usually about 3 hours, though.<br /><br />I seem to need the whole bottle, and I guess I'm one of the few that really prefers the Lemon-Lime flavor to the others.  The taste's not great; but it beats Red Bull and the like in taste, and effectiveness - and, you only have to drink the small bottle instead of a whole can.  Only 4 calories.  Sugarfree.  Not much caffeine.  I can honestly say the only time I've experienced anything close to jitters, is when I drank two in one day.  Even then, it wasn't the usual ""too much caffeine"" jitters.  It's the best thing I've ever found.  Tried another brand last month- tasted even worse and didn't work as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend 5 Hour!",5
"This plant arrived packaged well and was loaded with baby ""tears"".  Unfortunately, the little plant did not make it.  Although the directions said that this plant likes a lot of moisture and daily misting, I believe I over-did the watering.  I am not used to this type plant, and I take full responsibility for its demise.  It's a shame because it was a unique little plant.",2
Wrigley now colors the spearmint gum and adds aspartame (Equal).  It's not what we grew up with.  I think the flavor and consistency is basically the same as the original version.,1
"I loved the idea of this snack. As others mentioned, enough crunch and volume that it is hard to finish a bag. The flavors are not that great. I really like Honey Mustard and Onion flavored snacks but the smart fries, not so much. My six yr old loves snacks but not even the cheddar was appealing to her.",3
"I had hard time finding a label to read online and now I know why.  Breakfast Essentials is full of sugar.  This one was 27 carbs with one serving, others are as high as 37 carbs with one serving.  Trust me this is not the way to get your essentials.  This is just a way to get your kids or yourself hook on Sugar and Carbs.  START READING LABELS and stay away from products like this.",1
"The product is clumpy in the individual packages. I shook the package and put it in my coffee, where it lumped up in the bottom of my cup. I've only had these a couple of weeks, and they should be shelf stable for about a month or more. Of course no returns on this product. What gives?",1
"Like other xylitol gum I've tried the flavor was good but the gum was hard and within minutes it was grainy and unpleasant to chew, unlike Trident gum, which is sweetened, at least partly, with xylitol, is good chewing gum and that's the whole point!",3
This coconut is absolutely wonderful in the homemade granola that I make twice a month. It really gives it slight sweetness and the texture is GREAT.,4
"This oatmeal is very good, no doubt, but I don't buy it here at Amazon because the price is too high.  It is $4.99 a can at Whole Foods.  If your price is higher than Whole Foods, you know you need to revisit it!<br /><br />But, there is something available at Amazon that will make cooking the oatmeal a breeze, especially on weekdays, this little, Proctor Silex 1.5 quart slow cooker!  There are several different sources for it here on Amazon.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002CA3C6"">Proctor Silex 33015 1.5-Quart Round Slow Cooker</a><br /><br />I think this is the best very small pot because it has more than one temp setting and runs true to temp.<br /><br />Put 1 cup of the steel cut oats + 4 cups of water in the crock, set it to ""low"" and go to bed.  When you wake up, you'll have perfectly cooked oatmeal without standing over the stove.  It makes between 2-4 servings depending on how much oatmeal you can eat at a sitting!  We get 4 out of it with two grownups and to kids. Another plus is that you can keep the oatmeal warm in this pot for quite a while, accommodating a family where everyone doesn't get up at the same time.",4
"If you like granola and brownies, then this will be for you!  It has an oaty, nutty taste and texture with chocolate sweetness in every bite.  Almost dessert for breakfast with no down side.",5
"I bought these for my 10-month-old, and my 2-year-old. I opened one up for each of them when we received them, and my 2-year-old daughter inhaled the entire thing in one breath. My youngest slurped hers up in less than 1 minute (while it usually takes her 15 minutes to eat a 4 oz jar of food). They love these so much. My eldest is constantly begging me for them now.<br /><br />I did try one for myself, and thought it tasted a little funny, but that's my adult taste buds. There couldn't be anything better than these according to the little ones. =) I'll definitely buy these again. It's such a great treat, and so easy to grab when on the go. Great for breakfast, snacks, lunch, or any time!",5
"Bought this to work with my Keurig (self-fill cups) and wanted a Kona coffee.  It's good, but not the same as the Lion coffee that is the other Kona coffee I drink.  It's a tad more bitter, while the Lion is smoother and richer.  That being said, I am still drinking this every day until it's gone.  Not bad at all, especially for the price.",4
I purchased apple jacks first and then i purchased this.<br /><br />It is one of the best deals i can get on cereal.<br /><br />Plus its free shipping,5
"I'm a big fan of the Blue Diamond brand almonds and I especially like the ""bold"" flavors.<br /><br />The Lime n Chili flavor is my favorite with the Habanero BBQ being a close second.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer that says the tartness of the lime flavor is just enough to bring out the chili flavor. Its a nice balance.<br /><br />I would say my only complaint is towards the end of the bag the flavor can get a little overwhelming because of all the extra spices that accumulate towards the bottom.",5
"This squid product is quite nice. The ink and the condiments are on target. I did not quite enjoy the fact that the calamari was sliced rather than packed in chunks. nevertheless the portion of ink made up for that. It's quite right to cook the mediterranean ""black rice"" with onions, tomatoe paste, olives, garlic powder and a hint of hot sauce (and capers if you are into). Overall I am pleased with this product.",4
"With the first sip, you can taste the bitter, burned nut flavor in this Gloria Jeans k-cup.  Top it off with a major aftertaste (cream & sugar didn't help) & this blend went straight to the bottom of my list.<br /><br />If you want a nice hazelnut coffee, try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IRGDFW"">Millstone Coffee, Hazelnut Cream, 12-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 3)</a>.",1

"This fresh honey energy candy is quite good tasting. That's exactly what it tases like, - fresh honey.<br />I like the fact that each drop contains 1/3rd the daily value of vitamins B6, B12, and vitamin C.<br />The benefit of 'brain food' is something you don't normally get in a candy.<br /><br />There are 9 peices in each packet, one box contains 24 packets.<br />That's 216 peices at the current price of $27.69 = 12.81 cents each drop.<br />That figure seems quite a reasonable amount for a candy that's for the most part healthy.<br /><br />After using one pack of 9 peices I can't say I noticed any energy 'boost',<br />but this product is certainly worth using in place of junk candy,<br />which will leave you with a very noticeable energy 'low'.<br /><br />This candy deserves 5 stars for it's taste and healthful properties.<br />In other words, 5 stars for NOT CONTAINING --<br />Saturated Fat, Trans Fat, Omg, and Sodium.<br /><br />The one point I wonder about is, this candy is made in, and imported from Italy.<br />For those who use honey regularly you likely already know that,<br />studies have shown that honey harvested the closest to where you live is more suited to nourish your body.<br /><br />Having said that, I still feel it's a great little snack, and a pretty good cough drop too!",5
"I purchased two large bags of nuts from this seller. I contacted them, more than once, to inform them that there was a bug in one of the bags of nuts. I told them that I did not want a refund, just thought they should know. I threw the bag in the garbage. I sent a photo of that bug. They flat out replied that they do not believe that the bug was in the bag or came with the bage of nuts. The New York Health Department and the Food and Drug Administration should visit this seller. Beware buyers! You may purchasing nuts with bugs!",1

"I used Fresh Step and Scoop Away cat litters for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that they were the best ""bang for the buck"" litters. They clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, they form a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase one of these litters. Both products are made by the Clorox Pet products Co. Consider yourself warned!",1
"I realize it's a matter of taste, but in spite of everyone else's rave reviews for these, Larry and Mo, very independent opinionated cats, hate these. I thought ""great reviews, soft treats, salmon, slightly cheaper than Whiskas Temptations...woohoo!"" BUT, even Easy Mo turns his nose up at these...they will only eat them if they think the other one is going to...heaven forbid that one cat should get something that the other one didn't! Now, I can shake a bag of Temptations and Larry will magically appear out of the Ethernet. With Temptations, they remind me of those cats in the commercial where they are clinging to the guy's legs so they look like furry slippers, only an observer would say to me, ""Cute slippers, but did you notice they don't match?"" Larry & Mo's preference list is: 1. Whiska's Temptations (especially the Barbecue ones!), 2. Whiska-Temps Tartar Control (or Dentabites, whatever they are called), 3. W-Temps Hairball Control Treats (They will sit and look at these for several minutes before approaching them), and dead last, the WLTM Treats...requiring two competing cats to prod each other into eating them. Sorry, WLTM Mfg., Larry and Mo say, ""Back to the drawing board..ah, test kitchen...for these.""",1
"My dog is a 62lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix that repeatedly suffers from allergies, especially food allergies. He can also be a bit of a picky eater when it comes to his treats so finding the right mix can often be difficult. I always have reservations about trying new treats as a large majority of popular dog treats today are filled with terrible ingredients not to mention carrying a high price tag. I'm always willing to try a new treats so here are my thoughts on Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Chicken Treats;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ High in protein, 40%.<br /><br />+ Minimally processed and freeze dried raw ingredients.<br /><br />+ Dog loved them.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Expensive.  $10 for four ounces is a lot.<br /><br />- High in fat, 34%.<br /><br />- Messy and crumbly texture.<br /><br />My dog really enjoyed Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Chicken Treats.  Despite being extremely high in fat content the freeze dried raw ingredients are quite healthy compared to many of treats on the market.  Unfortunately, the high price tag on these treats would make me hesitant about purchasing them on a regular basis.",3

"I received this box with great anticipation since they don't sell these on the west coast. I got the package, opened the box and was EXTREMELY disappointed. The cookies looked like a gorilla shook the box to death and left most of the box filled with crumbs. AND THERE WAS A RODENT SIZED HOLE ON THE SIDE OF THE BOX!!!!!!!! So, needless to say I will not NOT be reordering these again.",1
The picture is really deceiving. The lollipops are so small compared to the picture. Do not buy this if you are expecting them to look like the ones in the picture.,1
"Do not buy these!!!!<br />And if you think you can ignore all the negative reviews, just because you so sorely wanted a pasta substitute, you'll be extremely disappointed. What's amazing is that even many of the 4 and 5 star reviewers admit to the things tasting horrible. But still, because they're labeled as 'noodles', some people will maintain a willingness to force them down.....such is the lure  of Pasta!<br /> I suppose you could freeze fecal matter and sell it as ice cream and  some people would choose  to eat it if they desperately craved ice cream and wanted to believe the packaging.<br /><br />These are shaped like noodles.<br />All resemblance to any type of real noodle ends there.<br /><br />Horrible smell....as noted here,gags many people.Smells like a fish that rotted in a beaker of benzene<br />Horrible texture....like a scary foreign body in your food.<br />No flavor (beyond the obnoxious smell) They don't really absorb any flavor either. The sauce just coats the outside, and in eating, any  sauce  quickly departs the  noodle surface and you're left with this disgusting mass of  slimy rubber  worms in your mouth. Even well rinsed, the weird fishy smell remains in your olfactory memory throughout the meal, thereby  eliciting a constant, low order,  gag reflex as you try to chew these things.<br /><br />Somehow I pushed the order button twice...so I'll be throwing out $60 worth of 'food',. Not sure I want them in my garbage can. I may have to drive them straight to the local land fill.<br />I didn't expect greatness from a zero calorie noodle, but I really hoped these things would  at least be a palatable substitute.....not even close.<br /><br />Proving again; there's no such thing as a free lunch.",1
"Gloria Jeans coffee is a little weak for my taste. Not as much flavoring. I have found that the Timothys and the green mountain have a much more intense flavor, and the coffee is stronger.",2
This is the basically the cheapest form to buy any of the three popular coconut water. I did the math and to put the cost in retrospective it comes to $10 per 2 liters of this coconut water.<br />This may not register to some with no concept of themselves being ripped off. There are other things out there that are better quality and less expensive and more specific for what you are looking for. If your look for something to quench thirst I highly recommend Metromint water. If your looking for things for your natural lifestyle then find a fruit with more umph than coconut.,2
"We ordered the box of candy for an anniversary gift along with a separate order of flowers.  The flowers arrived in a timely fashion but the candy arrived 6 days later.

Not really the best tea but not awful either. It is good if you just feel for a cup of tea and don't have anything else.,4

"I bought this from Walmart because it was the least expensive catnip they had.  Mixed in the catnip, especially at the bottom, were small stones, really hard sticks, and small pieces of clear plastic (looked like sandwich baggie plastic). I immediately stopped using it and am in the process of contacting the company. It reads that it is grown and processed in China.

I got the Paramount Entertainment popcorn maker with the 6 oz kettle.<br /><br />Here's the right way to pop this corn in the 6 oz version, take exactly half of the three ingredients and put them in and THEN when they are done do the other half.  No more 60% old maids anymore, thing is the bag seems sized to the 8 0z hopper and its just too much for the 6oz at once so alot wasnt popping.  Doing half at a time changed everything, very good popcorn!",4
"Unfortunately, I haven't found anything I can make this coffee in where the filter doesn't become instantly clogged.<br /><br />The filter on my French press is quite tolerant being a decent model but the grinds still get through the filter quite excessively.<br /><br />With a drip coffee maker, a permanent gold filter has no chance, as the fine grind blocks the filter and quickly causes the coffee maker to overflow. Paper filters are even worse, clogging up almost instantly.<br /><br />I'll end up giving it away since I can't actually make a good batch without excessive messes.",2
Perhaps one had to grow up with it to appreciate it.  Overly sweet with a dense consistency and a pasty texture.,1
"I just cannot understand the high praise these chips have received.  I ordered the variety pack and am very disappointed.  All flavors have a really weird taste to them, except for maybe the plain chips.  The salt and vinegar especially tasted gross!  I took one bite and had to throw the bag away.  Now I'm stuck with a bunch of chips that I'll never eat.",1
"Just wanted to warn any potential buyers that I received an open package buying from Amazon LLC.  I think that's pretty disgusting since this is a product that's intended for consumption by your pet.  Also, there were portions of the red ""meat"" that looked like it had been chewed on and the white bone portion was stained red all over.  Basically it looked as if a dog had chewed on it for a little and then repackaged up and sold on Amazon.  Buyer beware.",2
"I have no issue with the product, which I actually love. However, for some reason, Amazon, or whoever is responsible for the shipping, decided to change the method for my last shipment. So, instead of receiving the product within 2 two days via UPS, they started using USPS snail mail, which took forever. I use the ""subscription"" service for a reason - so that I can count on the timely delivery of coffee and not run out. So, adding 5-6 days to the shipping time caused us to run out and have to make a trip to the store. Not cool. If delivery continues to be inconsistent, then there is no value to ordering this way, and I will go elsewhere.",2
"I think I read that these did not have eggs in them.  Perhaps that explains the ""hockey puck"" texture.  They have a great taste, although they are a LOT spicier than most ginger snaps.  But they are very hard. Ginger snaps are always kind of hard, but these go way beyond normal.  I had to soak them in milk to really enjoy them.  They also had something kind of chewey in them.  It only became chewey after you soaked it.  I thought maybe it was the ginger, but couldn't be sure. Still, if you like ginger and you like it really spicey and you don't mind dunking your cookies for longer than normal, they're good cookies.  If you don't like dunking or you don't like spicey ginger-flavored foods, skip these.",3
"Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are indeed soft. Individual wrapping of each cookie ensures that they stay soft and fresh until your are ready to eat them. Unfortunately, they are very bland tasting, which is a surprise for Quaker products. I wouldn't buy them if you expect a flavorful cookie. So you trade soft and fresh for flavorful. So if you are looking for cookies that excite your taste buds, I'm afraid you will have to look elsewhere.",3
"My daughter brings flavored lemon water to school everyday and I was looking for an alternative to her Splenda based lemon water. I thought this would be a great solution. Unfortunately, even though this is a very nice sweetener the lemon flavor is barely detectable. The scent is great though! In tea this is fine, but as a sweetener/lemon flavor enhancer for water, this is not a good solution- stick with real lemons and stevia.",2
I'd rather buy these cones from the grocery store for a little more money.  Most of the cones are broken and stale.  There are no expiration dates.  It just says deeded on a sticker.,2
"I drank this beverage during that part of the afternoon when my energy level desperately needs a boost. Only after consuming a third of this 16 oz. drink I felt more alert, energetic and a tad jittery. The drink is lightly carbonated, and fruity with a raspberry-like aftertaste. It's similar to Red Bull but the flavor is not as sharp and heavy, which kinda belies the intimidating skull, wings and dark d&eacute;cor of the can. `No Fear' contains 130 calories and if you're calorie conscious you don't need to drink the entire can for its effects to be felt.<br /><br />Like most energy drinks, this ought to be consumed if you're looking for a jolt of energy, not necessarily for the flavor. But it's tasty and it certainly wakes you up!",3

"I haven't made the tea yet, but I'm already rating this four stars just based on the aroma.  Actually, I'd have rated this five stars, but I was surprised that the tea came in an unsealed paper bag.  I thought that was a big no-no, that not storing the tea leaves in airtight containers causes the tea to lose its flavor faster.<br /><br />I'll update this review once I've steeped a cup.  In the meantime, I'm off to find a tin to store the tea.",4
"I used to be a huge fan of this.. wild salmon, 4g of protein, other great ingredients.. just ordered another 16 pack and discovered they have reformulated it to be completely different. It is really liquid-y.. impossible for an unskilled/careless self-feeder to have much left on the spoon by the time it gets to her mouth (may be okay for younger babies who aren't self-feeding yet though). Also it only has 1g of protein now - not sure why / if there is less salmon in it? Anyway, it's off the menu here, and I am disappointed to have lost a healthful, convenient option.",1

"I know that it's ridiculous to write a review of bottled water. It appears that I am the first to review it as well. I have to say it though to save others from making the same mistake. The bottles do not stand up. The plastic is so pliable that when you remove the bottle from the case and try to stand it on a flat surface, it will fall over. No matter how I have tried to squash the bottle flat on a table, it will fall over. It's frustrating and annoying. I will never buy Aquafina again. I'm sure the plastic is ""green"" or whatever but I'd like it if the bottle would stand up.",1
I had to give up coffee for a month as part of a detox/cleanse (The Clean Program). I needed something hot to drink in the mornings at work to keep my routine and wake me up. At first I subbed in green tea and yerba mate but they didnt really satisfy me. I did some research and found Crio Bru. I make it in a french press at the office. It brews like coffee and I enjoy the chocolaty taste. It has a rich creamy mouth feel and and my I taste chocolate long after its gone. I cant say it provides the same caffeine jolt of coffee but it does satisfy my craving. With 4 table spoons needed for each of my french press brews the bag is only going to last about 10 days..which can get expensive (then again Im used to free Starbucks and Seattle Best coffee at my office). I'll probably go back to coffee once Im off this program.,4
"Tried Stubb's Pork Marinade for the first time today expecting great flavors with possibly a little kick on my center cut boneless chops. Even went as far as marinating 6 hours prior and basting while cooking but found my pork chops basically flavorless. There was a slight and I mean slight vinegary taste but other than that, it tasted like a plain old pork chop with no seasoning at all. I've tried so many other marinades on the market which are a lot more successful than this one.",1
"I had never cared much for green olives, that is until I went to Spain, and had Spanish olives. Wow! I did a 180 with their rich, delicious flavor, so I only buy green olives from Spain (and olive oil too!).<br /><br />I was looking forward to trying these, but sadly, I found them to be extremely salty - and not as flavorful as others I've had.They would be good for tapenade, as the previous reviewer stated, or in a pasta sauce, or any ""dish"", as they will add flavor & salt (so you can adjust the final taste), and hold up well, however, I wouldn't recommend them as a superior ""stand alone"" to eat by themselves, which was the primary reason I bought them. I got them on sale, so at least the price was reasonable.<br /><br />I took off one point each for flavor, and too much salt<br /><br />Bottom Line: Suitable for recipes, don't recommend as a stand-alone olive for appetizer/snack.",3
"This is the coolest, yummiest little product. I hadn't heard of roasted chickpeas as a snack until recently. Then, when I tried The Good Bean samples at a local grocery store, I was hooked! They're super healthy and delicious, and I'm quite smitten with the packaging. Glad to see this on Amazon!",5
"after reading all the reviews, I thought this is a good to buy, after it arrived, I gave it to my son who is 7 month old, but he doesnt like it at all.  Then I found out it is too dry for his mouth.  I tried it by myself, the taste is ok, no suger taste which is great.  It reminds me what I had when I was little back to china.  However, I can find the same stuff in a nearby chinese store for much cheaper price.  If you have any chinese store nearby, I dont see any reason to have it for this expensive price.",2

"My kid loves chocolate milk. Or did until I got this, thinking I could sneak some veggies into that little stomach of his.  Mixed it up, didn't tell him I had made the swap and handed it to his little smiling face.  He ran away, came back and gave me a full glass back, telling me it was ""icky"".  Later, out of the blue he declared ""mommy, I don't like chocolate milk!"" I'm now trying to figure out how I can sneakily hide this stuff in other foods until I get rid of it.  Maybe chocolate cake?<br /><br />If it tastes as bad as it smells, I can't blame the poor guy.<br /><br />I also do agree that the packaging is terribly wasteful.",2
"(Three times I've tried to post a review of these and it never goes through... forgive my abruptness.)<br /><br />Popchips? As in, potato chips puffed like popcorn? You got it, bub. Surprising lightness to them--much more so than expected, which allows the taste of the toppings (in this case, chili lime) to seem supercharged. This can be a good thing or not, depending on how sensitive your tongue is. Also, the texture is passing strange at first. Takes a bit of getting used to, but once you're used to it, you'll be popping these like, well, popcorn.",4
I like flavored coffees but not my husband. That's part of why we got Keurig maker. Have started trying the different flavors and this is the dessert-y kind of flavor I'm looking for (and my other top favorite so far is Green Mountain's Caramel Vanilla Cream). Been making it on the 8oz mug setting and just fine!,5
"I have not tasted these, because I follow a gluten free diet, and have a sensitive digestive system. I never purchase food that is processed on shared equipment. I would not have purchased them had I known. The purpose of this review is to warn others that have similar sensitivities.<br /><br />Here is what is stated on the label: ""these nuts are proceeded on shared equipment with pecans, tree nuts, soy, milk, eggs, or wheat products""",3

"Let me preface this review by saying I love Annie Chun's products.<br /><br />That being said.. I'm not a huge fan of this specific flavor.<br /><br />Like all of the other Annie Chun products I've consumed, this one is no exception in having a nicely sized portion, excellent noodles, and being the ONLY product I've ever consumed that had dehydrated vegetables that actually tasted/felt like they were fresh once re-hydrated.<br /><br />What is keeping this from being 4-5 stars is that the Teriyaki sauce is just terrible. I truly cannot imagine how people can say it's ""delicious"". It doesn't even taste like Teriyaki. I'm eating my last bowl of it right now, and I would say the flavor just tastes like terribly seasoned soy sauce.<br /><br />Overall, I would give the noodles/veges/portion size 5 stars, and the sauce 2 stars (generously).",3
"Really tasty, but a little too spicy for me. Of course, I ate a half-dozen at a time. It didn't sit well with my insides. I suspect it has red pepper in it.",4
"I can say that this oil is everything other reviews has stated.  This oil has a very strong scent, but since I love herbal smells, I like it.  It does not bother me.<br />This oil works great as a pre-poo for natural 4a type afrotextured hair.<br />The only negative is the mineral oil.  Mineral oil coats the hair shaft and prevents moisture from getting in or out.",4
Im a big licorice fan - especially soft and chewy. This Haribo is a great price so i tried it. It was very fresh and chewy but really has no flavor outside of a slightly chemical taste.,2
I would never buy this cocoa ever again. this was by far the foulest substance to ever cross my lips. DONT BUY THIS<br />no stars,1
Great product from Vitacost. Loved it.  Never had such incredible tasting honey in my life.  Would recomend this product to all.  The cost is low too.  One could never get this volume for the cost at a store.<br />Deb,5
These outside does not have the crunch I was looking for and the nut is soggy. Complete waste of money. If it would have let me give no stars I would have.,1
It was a real pain to throw out the whole bag.....but it was too disgusting to open.... beware. I am a huge fan of Kirkland products-but this was not worth opening to try.  My local Costco doesn't sell this.,1
"The Caribou Blend k cups have fulfilled our household's need for a plain old cup of coffee in the morning that isn't anything fancy, but still gets the job done. We were searching for a blend that was smooth and flavorful while still being easy to drink and mild. I particularly like medium roasts and I don't care for a coffee with a lot of acidity and a bitter aftertaste, so this one fits the bill.<br /><br />The only downside to this k cup is that the aroma. It wasn't the most appetizing after the first cup was brewed, but it made up for that in taste. This isn't a point that really bothers me, but I could see it being a downside for some people.<br /><br />When I brew this blend on my way out the door, I often throw in some french vanilla creamer and it's my perfect morning caffeine kick.<br /><br />So far this is the best average blend we've tried. We're open to others but until we find something better, we're sticking with the Caribou Blend.",4
"So if you are a person who likes swiss miss / hot cocoa packets or hot cocoa from a gas station SO DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT!  I can not taste any chocolate flavor in it whatsoever.  It just tastes like heated sugar water and nasty sugar water at that.  This product has a strong fake sugar taste and I am perfectly OK with diet sodas and other fake sugar products.  There is something about this I just can not put a finger on it but it made my stomach curl.  I even waited for it to cool down, but it got worse.  Very disapointed in this product and it was not what I was expecting at all.",1
It really does what they say.  It tastes good but I don't like artificial sweeteners.,4
"I am on the Medifast diet, so was looking for a few low carb/low calorie options to add to my daily diet.  When I heard about Walden Farms calorie free peanut butter I was highly skeptical but decided to give it a try.  I have to say, that this product was probably THE worst tasting diet food I have ever eaten.  I am a huge fan of peanut butter, and thought maybe this would slightly resemble it, but the taste was nowhere close.  This product SERIOUSLY offended me.  I would give it to a homeless person, but I'm not that cruel.  If you're looking for peanut butter substitutes I'd recommend PB2.  It contains only peanuts and salt, and actually tastes like peanuts.<br /><br />Walden Farms DOES have good products, though.  I will say that their caramel dip is very good, but I wonder why they are still able to make enough money from this ""peanut butter"" to keep producing it!",1
"I have never been one to seek out specific shampoo brands.  I purchased whatever brand was on sale.  As long as it lathered up and did its job, I was happy.  The Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty shampoo proves there is a difference.<br /><br />First of all, the shampoo is far richer than other brands I've used.  It comes out of the easy-to-use dispenser in thick ribbons.  When it's massaged into the hair, it creates a luxurious feel -- an experience far removed from the routine shampooing I had always done.  In fact, I was inspired to do more scalp massaging than ever as I lingered in the shower.<br /><br />It has a faint scent, not an overly perfumed one, and I liked that.  I can't really confirm the fact that it has strengthened my hair, as I've never had a problem with ""breakage.""<br /><br />My wife used it and was pleased with how smooth her hair felt after the shampoo was rinsed out.  She has used several kinds of better shampoos over the years, and she reported that the Clear Scalp & Beauty shampoo compares favorably.  Neither of us used the shampoo in conjunction with its companion conditioner, which further leads me to believe we saw no appreciable difference in our hair being strengthened.<br /><br />The big question:  Would I seek this product over others in the future?  Perhaps.  I do like its rich texture, so that might lure me back.  However, a premium price might easily point me back to more economical products.<br /><br />Conclusion:  This is a good product that lathers better than many shampoos, leaving the hair smooth and easy to manage.",3
"I am sorry to say these cookies did not taste at all like sugar cookies. They were actually salty, and not nice and chewy. The only good thing is that they arrived in one piece, no crumbs. However it did not deliver on the taste. Iw ill no0t be ordering from Scott's items again.",1
"I bought this because I love peanut butter, and am looking to eat healthier. First taste wasn't that bad...but the more I ate the more it started to gross me out haha I guess if you used it on a PB&J sandwich it wouldn't be so bad, but I was eating it with like apples and it just wasn't tasting good. I wasn't really thinking when I bought it.",2
"I bought this after reading the reviews hoping it would help me get to sleep better.  It simply does not work for me.  I've tried drinking it slow maybe an hour before bed, I've tried guzzling it down.  I'm still lying in bed for hours.  I gave it two stars because regardless of its inability to work for me, it tastes pretty good (almost like a mello yello if you're from the south) so I'll still be able to drink it and it wont be a complete waste of money.  Buying them here, I'm paying about 2.60 a can which is definitely not worth it to me.",2
"Lipton Black Tea, Black Pearl Pure Long Leaf, Premium Pyramid Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6<br />I originally purchased this tea from the grocery store. When I saw them here I thought that it was a great price. This tea is not as strong as the original one that I purchased in the store.  It appears to be weaker in taste, I have to use 2 teabags from this box in order to get the same flavor as the ones that I originally purchased from the grocery store.",1
"My dog absolutely loves this toy.  It takes her about 40 minutes to get a cup of kibble from it.  It is great for her mentally and physically.  It has also been a tremendous help to her digestion, as she was a ""competive eater"" when we adopted her, always wolfing down her food in seconds, and as a result having ""intestinal turbulence"" with alarming frequency.  The tug a jug forces her to eat slowly.  It took her a while to get the hang of it, so it was a supplement, not a substitute, for her regular meals at first.  But now that she knows how it works, I usually feed her one of her two meals in it each day.  The other day, I actually split her dinner between the food bowl and the tug a jug, and she opted to play with the tug a jug for 25 minutes before going for the ""easy meal"" in her bowl.  I can't think of a better endorsement than that!  The one drawback is that it breaks down somewhat easily.  We are on our third tug a jug.  Each previous one has lasted about a month before our dog has bent the end the food goes in enough that it can't be closed anymore.  So, we buy three at a time now.  They're not that expensive, and I think they're totally worth it.",4
"Sometimes you want a snack with a little substance (albeit mechanically seperated chicken and MSG), and Slim Jim's satisfy that craving. I polished off the box in about a month and I don't regret the purchase one bit. You probably should go easy on them if you buy them though. Whatever spicy juice or grease these things are packed with can become unpleasant if you go through more than 3 or 4 of these in a short period. I averaged about 3 a day and sometimes it was just what i needed to shut my stomach up during a boring meeting.",4
"Kellog's has brought out a new Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bites cereal--this time it's Cinnamon Roll. I liked the size which makes it almost perfect for those of us who love to snack on breakfast cereal at all hours of the day and the cinnamon flavor is not too strong. The carbs seem a little high but, on the plus side, these are very good on iron, thiamin and solid on fiber. While there are better products on the market, this was not a bad cereal by any means.",4
"Because it's easily available, this is my go-to mix when I need to make something. Because it only makes one layer, I use it to make cupcakes, muffins or a layer I can split and fill (such as Boston cream pie).<br /><br />The mix is rather lackluster by itself; it needs help. Because it has plenty of xanthan gum in it, it's easy to doctor this mix. Recommended additions are blueberries + lemon peel, or peanut butter, or a mashed banana and a dash of cinnamon. Vanilla always helps too.<br /><br />By itself the texture is rather dry and coarse. I coax the most out of this mix by using buttermilk, vanilla, and the two-stage mixing method.",3
"I was really excited to have a blend of peppercorns.  However, since there is allspice mixed in with these it really throws the flavor off of, well, all of my dishes.  You can taste the pepper yet you also taste a earthy, kind of pungent bite as well.  I even tried picking through the peppercorns and removing the allspice.  It was too late, the flavor is still mixed in there.  &lt;shrug>  Too bad.",2
"My kids and I tried it...had to throw the whole box away.  It is sickeningly sweet and gives you an aftertaste that you know the ""sugar"" is synthetic.  So so icky!",1
"Supposedly increases milk production? Yeah, I didn't see a difference after drinking this for a good 3+ weeks. Aside from that, it doesn't smell or taste very good. Very herbal medicine-like.",2
"For the amount you get, this price is great. However, these aren't cookies, make sure you digest that. These are a little more bitter. They're more like crackers. The packaging is unique and cute, the product presents itself really well, I'm just not a huge fan of the taste.",3
I knew what I wanted and was searching for this Bigelow Ginger Tea.  I found the supplier to be very fair in regards to their price.  They were prompt on shipping and delivery.  The item was received in excellent condition and in a timely manner.<br />  I would buy again from this supplier and probably will when my present supply runs out<br />  Thank You,2
"I'd never heard of Kamut before it showed up in my Gold Box deals (since I had purchased some other Red Mill products), but decided to give it a try based on the positive reviews. I'm glad I did. As a hot breakfast cereal, it has a nutty flavor and a consistency similar to MaltoMeal, but is much better for you! The taste took a little getting used to (it's best with some milk and brown sugar) but I now like it quite a bit. I've added it to my breakfast mix, and alternate it with oatmeal. I've also started mixing in a tablespoon or two of flax seed from time to time. It also goes really well with fresh berries, or even frozen blueberries if you thaw them out first.<br /><br />While not quite supplanting oatmeal as my hot cereal of choice, Kamut has proven to be well worth the purchase; tasty, healthy, and organic. What more can you ask for from a product purchased on a whim?<br /><br />*****UPDATE 07/15/2010*****<br /><br />I tried making the ""Pharaohs Muffins"" recipe on the back of the package and loved it! I added chopped dates, raisins, and ginger, as well as a pinch of cinnamon. I also omitted the butter and sugar, and instead used apple sauce. The muffins turned out extremely well, and I'll be making them again. My wife also loved them, as did the coworkers I shared them with. They were pretty surprised to find out they clock in at 145 calories and have virtually no fat! So give them a try--they are worth it.",4
"Forget all that you know about instant coffee.  This stuff rocks!  I don't always have time to brew a cup of coffee, so when I don't, it's VIA to the rescue!  Of all the VIA flavors, mocha is my favorite.  It's very similar to a mocha beverage from Starbucks with the convenience of instant coffee.<br /><br />What makes it better is it's ALL NATURAL!  No chemicals, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup.  A lot of mocha syrups (and many other flavors from brands) have artificial flavors, so it's refreshing to find one that does not.<br /><br />GO STARBUCKS!",5
"I was hoping to find a green tea with very little caffeine; no ""decaffeinated"" tea has no caffeine. This one, however, still made me jittery; I could feel the effects immediately.",3
"Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers, Ziti & Meat Sauce is a very convenient food to keep on hand. It would be great to keep in your desk at work, dorm room, or take on a trip. The packaging is well designed and even has a lift tab to make it easier to get the sauce package out. The plastic pieces are Number 5, which is recyclable in my town. The instructions are easy to follow and simple. Put water in to the line with the noodles and cook in the microwave for 3.5 mins and drain noodle. Next heat the sauce for 30 seconds and pour over the noodles. Mix and eat. The taste is very fresh and certainly better than leftovers. There are 340 calories per single serving package. The ingredient list is not too long and almost entirely recognizable. The sauce is pleasantly spicy. I would not make this at home, but it is a great convenience food for places that lack refrigeration or cooking facilities.",5
"I'd rather have half a hershey bar or snicker than eat this to be honest. first you open the package, the brownies are about 1"" by .5"", in other words, you can fit one on your thumb's finger tip (and as a 5 foot-2 woman, I have small hands). it was like eating one small brownie, broken up into smaller brownies. to be completely honest, these would probably go great in some ice cream, eating them alone is quite uh... boring. and unsatisfying. I'm giving it 3 stars for concept and effort, but I will be giving these to my toddler (which would be the ideal target market for these LOL). He will love them.",3

"It might have been luck or the fact that I ordered some other products as well, but I managed to get a box of these without ANY of them leaking.  No sticky mess, just a few dented, which can be expected.  Box was inside a bigger box with a few other items and some air bags.  Great creamer without the sticky mess!",4
"And as the owner of a much-loved dog, isn't that what's most important? So far I've purchased the peanut butter flavor most often because that's my Doberman's favorite, but she's also had the beef flavor and the bacon and cheese (which she hated). So far, no staining on her bedding at all. When she brings one to me that's all slobbery, wanting to play fetch with it, none of the food dye is left behind on me or my clothes either - and she's gone through well over a dozen of this brand of rawhide.<br /><br />One of the things I look for when I buy rawhides for her is if they are completely coated in flavor all the way through, or if they just cover what is visible through the packaging. The reason I do this is because my Dobie is a greedy monster and she will just lick off the goodies and cast aside the rest. So far, with these bones, they have been completely covered and she makes them swiftly disappear.<br /><br />The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the bones that were shipped to my house have always been slightly smaller than advertised. For instance, almost every single 7-8 inch bone I ordered topped out at just a bit over 6 inches. I know it's a small thing, especially if the dog is happy, but she goes through 2-3 of these a week, so it can add up a bit. I just wanted to explain why not 5 stars. If they start showing up the way they are supposed to be, I'll happily change my rating.",4
"I love their teas. Their hot cinnamon spice is truly excellent and the chocolate mint is very good. The sachets are really nice also and are very hard to tear. I was a bit disappointed with this tea. I have a hard time tasting the coconut. The chocolate comes through, however. It depends on how much money is spent on the tin. If it is $15 for 20 satchels that is a bit pricey. Most of the other H & S teas are less than $10. I would have expected more of the coconut taste come through. One of the other reviewers thought it was strong. Well it might be for them, but I can barely taste it. I really like the taste combination in other things. I give it 3 stars as long as the price is above $15.",3
"These are great animal crackers. My kids all love them. It's great to have a portable snack that my chemically-sensitive kids can eat. These are going to be great to bring on picnics, to the park, on car trips, etc.<br /><br />The biggest quibble I have is that the ""snack-size"" bags are a little too large for younger kids (pre-schoolers or kindergartners) to finish at one sitting. If I send a bag in with my kindergartner for snack time, even though he loves them he can't finish them all. About 1.5 oz would be plenty for young kids.<br /><br />Ironically, they are cheaper per ounce in the snack size bags than in the larger boxes. You'd expect it to be the other way around.<br /><br />I'll definitely be ordering more of these.",5
"Very unhappy with this purchase.  There was essentially no taste.  The crust was basically flour with a little salt added, the ingredients on the inside of the bread tasted mass-produced.  Combined with the extremely high shipping costs, this is a very poor product.  If they sent me another one for free I would put it in the trash, it is just not worth eating.",1
Buy Spinach & Roasted Garlic Crackers if a teaspoon of salt in every cracker appeals to you.  The cracker doesn't even make the current list of what the company offers.,1
"I love Ostrim Natural Flavor and used to buy it at local deli and/or GNC, decided to buy on amazon to save money.  But this one taste dry and old, like its past its expiration date or something.  I was looking for the expiration date on the box and found none",2
"We were shocked to find out that Dogswell a company we have been buying our dog treats for last several years have started outsourcing these dog treats to China. This is very disappointing considering 4-5 years ago when many pets in the US died due to food poisoning resulted from pet food packed in China.<br /><br />It is very surprising why this product got around 4/5 rating. I am assuming either  many buyers, like us, did not read where this is manufactured as the text ""Made in China"" is written in small alphabets and hidden in other text behind the cover OR most of these reviews in 2010 and 2011 look suspiciously 'fixed'...notice how many of them got 1 out of 1 likes.<br /><br />We have stopped feeding our dog this food out of legitimate concern.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Feb 2012: Just to update that our dog died recently after diagnosed suffering from Hemolytic Anemia and Diabetes. We fed our dog these treats for number of years and now wonder just how much they contributed to her illness considering these treats are NOT made in USA but China.",1
"I ordered the ginger lemon cremes, but was very disappointed to find Amazon screwing up so badly.  The outside of the box as shipped from the vendor to Amazon clearly says ""VANILLA"" in very large letters, but Amazon slapped a sticker with a barcode on it that tags the box of cookies as ""ginger lemon cremes,"" so now instead of enjoying the ginger lemon cremes I had been looking forward to tasting, I have to go through the hassle of trying to return these and hopefully get Amazon to send me the right product a second time around.  So, now I have to wait to see if I actually get ginger lemon cremes in another few weeks or however long Amazon takes.  Boy, their service has gotten worse and worse every year since I started buying stuff from Amazon back in their early days.",3
"To each, his own!  That phrase basically says that each one of us is different and as such, our preferences also tend to differ.  This idea applies not only to humans, but to our canine friends as well.  And when buying toys for your dog, that is an important consideration to keep in mind.  Some dogs will love this toy, while some will simply ignore it.  That is a frustrating part of trying to keep your dog entertained.  Because you see, buying toys for your dog can be just as much of a hit-or-miss proposition as buying a gift for a blind date.<br /><br />So what can you do, to avoid spending money on a pricey item that your dog might not like?  There are no guarantees, but you can take the time to watch your dog carefully.  After some time, you will notice what types of toys captivate his attention.  Based on my observations over the years and owning different breeds, I have come to believe that the more impulsive individuals might not find entertainment with this toy.  However, those obsessive, focused types like you see in Rottweilers, German Shepherds, and Labradors would be delighted to chew on this for days.<br /><br />Impulsive dogs tend to be the types who do not like to play fetch.  They may chase the ball once, but pretty soon, their attention span is very quickly diverted elsewhere.  My current dog is like that.  He just does not like to spend a lot of time chewing on an item that does not break apart easily.  The only way to engage him for a prolonged period of time is to give him something that breaks apart easily (pressed rawhide) or something that dispenses food (Kong and Starmark treat dispensers).  He is just not the obsessive type who would spend a lot of time gnawing on a durable object.  He needs constant and frequent reinforcement to keep his attention from wandering away from the toy.  Your dog may like it, depending on his personality and his breed.<br /><br />Nylabone is a maker of high quality dog toys.  This is a quality item.  It is just unfortunate that my dog's attention span is too short to be entertained by these types of toys.  Ofcourse, I found out the hard (or the expensive) way.  I bought the toy and my dog ignored it!",4
"Candy is not sour, like a previous review said, I had about 5 red in the tin.  Candy was sticky when opened, and for the $14 it cost (w/ shipping) I will not order again.",2
"I bought this, not for its gluten-free feature, but because I though the protein content would be high.  Quinoa is known for its really high protein content. However, a word of caution (probably my fault that i did not read the finer print properly) but this is a corn-quinoa mix.  My usual whole grain pasta actually has 75% more protein and 50% more fiber than this quinoa pasta. So really I regret buying it. However, taste wise, it's similar enough to wheat pasta but does not keep the tight neat shape of regular rotelle. I think it would be nice for those bound to a gluten-free diet.",3
"was really looking forward to this shipment--I remember Sapporo from my younger years in San Fran.  Spice packs were everything I remembered and loved but the noodles had a funny ""off"" taste, like the oil they used to fry them was waaaay past prime.  Finally just ripped out the spice packets and used ramen noodles from grocery store.  will not order again.",1
"Extremely tasty to a point of being addictive.  The sweet yogurt like coating gives it a nice smooth taste and sweetness to go with the almond.  Great with coffee if you don't put sugar in your coffee.  Product has no bad ingredients besides the usual High Fructose Corn Syrup, which isn't exactly bad.  Amazon has the best price when you buy on subscription, and even cheaper then Walmart.  At less then $2/box, you get 7.4 Oz, which is reasonable price.",5
"Sweet Dreams does not get me drowsy like some people may say.  But the taste for some reason and the smoothness, mildness of it seems perfect for a before bed drink.  Even the purple color it makes just looks like a relaxant.  Good to help you clear your mind before bed.  Again, I'm not saying it will, so don't depend on it.  It's just one of the best drinks to add to your bed time routine.

"I have a family of gummy lovers. Especially sour gummies.<br /><br />PROS:  These are really good. Addictingly so... Soft and squishy, and not hard at all.  Each color has a cool distinct flavor.  All colors are really good!<br /><br />CONS:  There is A LOT of it.  12 boxes, to be exact. So you'd better have a lot of people around who love them, or they will take up a lot of space in your pantry!!!",4
"This review applies both to the ""Chipotle"" and the ""Spicy Ranchero"" flavors, neither of which tastes much like anything identifiable. The base is a thin mayonnaise made from soybean oil, chemically dyed to vivid and rather odd colors. To that are added various natural and artificial flavors to create a strong, though only moderately spicy, flavor.<br /><br />This isn't really a sauce and it isn't very Mexican. What it is is the sort of bright-color/strong-flavor condiment that kids like to squirt over everything. Juvenile palates are evidently what it's intended for. Since that describes the clientele Taco Bell targets, it should go over well with them.",2
I have ordered these cookies numerous times.  This last order though was horrible.  The cookies were all burnt little crisps.  I wrote to the company about this issue and got no response.  Won't be ordering these again.  Buy at your own risk.,1
"While I continue to enjoy Dove Dark Chocolate, the order I received was below par. One reason was that they were close to their expiration date and had to be distributed and consumed shortly on receipt. Secondly every other Dove bar I have had was dark in color, smooth and great tasting, these were chalky white, with a bitter taste and some even looked as though the had been melted and poured into the wrapper.",2
"Most of the reviews are comparing this to some very unhealthy versions (like ""my local restaurant"") which is not fair.  It is about as healthy as you can get and still use real ingredients.  I like that it is not so loaded with salt (as others have complained).  It has a delicate flavor, and I didn't notice any aftertaste.  It was a little light in the veggies, but doesn't really need them to be good.  If you want taste at ""all costs"" then this is not for you.  If you generally eat healthy and are not addicted to salt you will like this soup very much.  I bought a can (at a local store) and ate it later that day, I went back to the store the next day for another can.",5
"My son doesn't care for it that much. It's this flavor only, all other Earths Best products he loves! I wish it would have been a variety pack instead of all one flavor.",3
"My six month old nephew happily ate this, each time it was offered, and although he can't tell us exactly how good it was, we could tell.<br /><br />We eat organic as much as possible so it's nice to offer babies organic food that's good for them.  This is a combination of pear, spinach and brocolli. I tasted it myself and would have no problem eating this.  It tastes like pureed pears and brocolli.  It isn't too sweet and is flavorful.<br /><br />Babies typically don't like any greens but this mixture containing the pear for a bit of natural sweetness is a good tasting mixture.<br /><br />There is nothing artifical in this.  You can know you are feeding healthy organic food to  your baby.<br /><br />It is also a ""convenience"" food, since you can feed it right out of the package, simply by squeezing it through the feeding tube and into a spoon, or into the baby's mouth if you are out somewhere.  The packages keep the food fresh, and they are spillproof in a bag along with your other baby items.<br /><br />I can highly recommend this.",5
"I was very disappointed, I didn't think the coffee lived up to its description. I won't buy it again.",2

"My mom is 82 years old and she has been telling me stories about how her father used to make huckleberry pies and how great they were. I wanted to give her a treat, so I Googled, Huckleberry, and found the company selling on Amazon. I called out to the store itself and spoke with a very friendly young lady named Krista. I wound up ordering their pie filling.<br />I first surprised my mom with the jam and she loved it!  Then I baked the pie and she said it was like her father's. I think she was being kind because the crust wasnt very good.<br />I would definitely recommend this product.",5
"Don't waste your money. These were shipped improperly, and were stale upon arrival. If they weren't stale, then they just had a bad flavor overall. I asked for a refund from Amazon.",1

"The Caribbean El Yucateco is a midway point between their regular habanero sauce and the hotter Salsa Kutbil-Ik -- the sauce smells spicy but a bit fruity when you open it up, but once it's on your tongue it tingles pleasantly. (disclaimer: I really like spicy food, so my ""tingles pleasantly"" may be ""burns horribly"" to some folks)  The sauce has a bit of onion powder and a rich flavor, and isn't too heavy on the vinegar since it uses a carrot base like Melinda's habanero sauces.  The piquant burning feeling lasted about 30 seconds if I took a drink of water and ate some tortilla chips to 2 minutes if I just let the flavor dwindle away normally.  This is good stuff; give it a try if you like your hot sauces flavorful instead of a pure capsaicin kick in the teeth.",5
"These just arrived, and I was first taken aback by how small the jar is (perhaps a squat half-gallon size), and it it is a scant two thirds full, not full to the top, as shown in the picture of the product (I am aware of the issue of settling, but trust me, you can't shake these enough to come close to the volume shown, in fact it is closer half full now). It is difficult to tell from a photo, but somehow I thought it was one of the large jars you you see in convenience stores; not even close. The silver dollar size is near accurate, each round is slightly larger than a silver dollar (this is a ground and formed beef jerky, not a natural muscle meat product, so the item size is consistent). The lid bears a large red label marked for retail sales at four for a dollar, which means that for the price I just paid ($18.82 for one jar), for the purchase of the entire jar, you are getting a bonus of about four of the little rounds off the full retail price if sold individually, or just under $.23.5 per bite size round. Curiously, there is a blank where it clearly shows the product weight should be listed, but I would estimate no more than a pound, tops. As to value for the price, I'd give it maybe two stars.<br /><br />This is a smoked, peppered beef jerky product, and I can see what appears to be pepper in the formed meat, but the flavor is quite mild on both counts. It isn't bad, but it's nothing to write home about, either. In all fairness, I like peppered meat, so I was looking for very peppery flavor; if you like a very mild pepper flavor you might be quite pleased. There is no natural grain to the meat, so it is sort of an odd leathery texture(much like fruit leather does not retain the original texture of the fruit). To me, this tastes about like a less salty than usual traditional jerky, which usually has some pepper; but being advertised as a peppered product, to my tastes, it falls short. I would give it a three on flavor; it tastes alright, just not a great spicy, peppery jerky.<br /><br />Over all, it doesn't taste bad, and I'm not going to throw it out, but it wasn't what I expected, either value or taste wise; I wouldn't buy it again.",3
"I recently order a 6-pack of Pero - hopefully to find a substitute for the Postum I have been drinking for over 50 years. Let me tell you -- Postum it's not! It tastes awful, and the aroma (smell) is even worse. I mixed just one cup, took one sip, flushed the rest down the drain and gave away all six cans. Taste and smell, of course, are individualistic and arbitrary, but if you're looking for something as close as possible to the now extinct Postum, don't waste your money on this one!",1

My wife and I started a tradition years ago where we would make Boboli pizza's and rent a movie every weekend.  The boboli crusts that used to be so good have progressively become worse and worse the last couple of years.  What used to be a thick but light crust with lots of cheese on it has become a blob of almost uncooked dough with only a couple specks of cheese.  They seem to keep changing the recipe and each time it gets worse.  It's definitely time for a new tradition!!!,1

Green Mountain now colors the box light green but this product is caffeinated. Wife got Snookered caused she thought Medium roast didn't have caffeine; just cause the box was light green.

"These are not at all what I was expecting when I popped one in my mouth.  It is a very nice union of salty and sweet with a light sweet yam flavor.  Some sweet potato chips are too strong tasting for me, but not these.  These are light and airy, but still provide a good crunch.  Kind of a cool feeling on your tongue too, like bubbles evaporating. I think these are my new chip because my waist certainly can't afford the fat in traditional chips anymore.",4

"This product meets all of my expectations.  I found the product to be fresh, the seeds were whole, and the bags contained little if any debris.

I will continue to use this provider for flax seeds as long as the price does not increase and the product continues to meet my needs.",3
"It's not bad, as the fragrance just hits you when the bag opens. That being said, way too many stems in the product. I'm not a tea expert, but I've bought enough and I think they have more stems than the average. I do like the eco-friendly no frill packaging with the zipper though.",3

"I have used the Gold Rush brand sourdough starter in the past with success. Since I couldn't locate any locally, I hoped to buy it on Amazon.

I really really like these brownies - they are 75% organic (at least that is what the package says).  I just received my second shipment of 2 boxes yesterday.<br /><br />Question for the manufacture:  why all the waste and individually wrapping these?

I tried to ease him onto the food over a few days and it did not do much to help he was consistently sick until I changed his food",3
"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1

I'm not one of those idiots who doesn't like being able to taste things for minutes after they've used their hot sauce.",4
"I can't think of a product that Newman's Own makes that I don't like.  This is probably the closest.  Perhaps a more refined palate of a coffee connoisseur would disagree, but I find this coffee to be disappointing.

"My 10 year old son loves chocolate but wasn't particularly impressed by these cookies. For a Chips Ahoy product, they are good, but there's still a ""manufactured cookie"" quality to it, versus a small batch or homemade quality. The base cookie is not dry, but spongey. There are 2 kinds of chips that have a nice sweet taste that go good together. The main issue I found is the claim it is gooey. I think that's an overstatement. While there is a small amount of fudge goo in the middle, it doesn't make the whole cookie gooey. If anything, a moderate sensation of gooeyness is produced once you chew the entire cookie in your mouth, but it's nowhere near, say, a chocolate fudge brownie. These are more light and soft, not thick and gooey.",3
"These are tastey. I purchased at a grocery store on sale. I disagree with some other reviewers about the strong peanut butter flavor.

I would ask that they increase the amount of protein to make them a better product for me.",4

Also you can't use them for more than one cup as you can some regular ground coffee k-cups.  Overall though - the flavor is excellent and well worth the 4 stars!,4

I've checked all the local stores, asked the purchasing manager at one, and none of them know why they can't get any.  They've been stocking other Bear Naked products (a very vanilla, sweet brand called Fit Almond Vanilla Crunch) in place of Peak Protein. It is not in stock at Amazon or any of the other net sites, and it is not in stock at Bear Naked's home web page, but there is no explanation by Bear Naked about why and the Bear Naked Faq says nothing about it.<br /><br />I read somewhere that Kellogg's had taken over Bear Naked.  If that is the case, perhaps they are reformulating Peak Protein, improving what was already perfect, like Coca Cola did when it brought out ""New Coke.""; at least Coke gave Cokeheads a forewarning, allowing them to stack up on the old stuff before it was pulled off the market.",5
"Ah I remember this assortment from when I was a young gal.  I think this is the perfect Trick or Treat, treat, just toss a few in the bag and you have made a kid happy. I just love having different kinds right there for me to chose which one. They packaged, Krackle, Mr. Goodbar, Hershey's Special `Dark, Hersey's milk chocolate, four total and I just tried all four and they were delicious, fresh and sweet and melty.  The only one thing is that it is more expensive here but it can be shipped free if you get to $25.00.. That is a deal if you cant get out to buy everything. Besides life is too short the sweat the small stuff.<br /><br />I am happy and I think you will be too.",4
"Izze Apple is a nice, refreshing break from water and tea which I mostly drink when at home. I am not a huge fan of soda, mostly because it's so unhealthy but I do enjoy gingerale from time to time and this stuff is pretty good. The apple flavor is balanced with strong tang from the grape and some lemon, it does taste a bit champagne like - so I will agree with the other reviewers who say that perhaps it should be truer to it's name and have more of the main flavor than fillers.<br /><br />I will repurchase this after the Vine order runs out, the cans are small and cute and you can fit lots of them in your fridge, it's also a small portion so I'm not forced to finish a huge can while not wanting to waste anything. This stuff is sour and bubbly and lightly sweetened and I like it, it's enjoyable.<br /><br />- Kasia S.",4
"My dog loves pumpkin-based canned food on his staple kibble (with warm water on top all mixed in to make it a meal...like hot soup), but he doesnt care for these. i spent a lot of money on these too. they are very light and airy, so 3 ounces is like a decent size canister. the shipper was good though. write me here on amazon me if you want to buy these from me. they are fresh and purchased April 2011 and will be stored in a cool, dry, dark place now. oh, i have a golden (if that matters). I rated it 3 because it looks nutritious and all, but he just doesn't like theflavor, as it may be too ""strong""...probably just a matter of taste. But on a related note, DO try the dog treats that are called ark naturals brushless chewable toothpaste. they work great and are actually treats! i may write a review for those. i think there are 2 reviews for those thus far. its a relatively new product thats just catching on and heard about it from my local pet store, where the large bag was $28, plus tax!. he likes those a lot and he gets 1 at night and it made his teeth white, gums pink and breath fresh! and they are not minty so they dont smell bad and pungent. i didnt have to have my dogs teeth professionally cleaned...which is a lot of money, and most want to put your dog under(?)!!! got to go... bye now, and thanks for reading my review! peace! Ruff!",3
"roduct arrived timely. Six boxes. I sampled this tea in a resturant and it was delicious. Can't say the same for my purchase. Good tea, but not as flavorful as Bigelow.",3
Purchased them for my mother-in-law for her birthday. She loved receiving something found out east where she is from. Thanks.,4
My baby is lactose intolerant and had diarrhea and wasn't gaining weight.  We switched to this about three months ago and he's gained a couple of pounds and inches and looks very healthy.  He does seems to be getting eczema though so we might try the Similac Alimentum to be sure it's not this formula.  We rinse his mouth out with water after a feeding which seems to help with his skin.,4
"I was very excited to find this product.  It is suppose to be the same yeast as in the ""Rapid Rise"" and the product for bread machines.  I used the exact amount for my recipe: a typical 1/4 ounce strip envelope equals 2 1/4 teaspoons.  The end result was a baked product that tasted foul.  I contacted Fleishmann's Company the next morning.  I was told that they would replace the two pounds of yeast I had purchased with a (three envelope strip with a total of 3/4 ounces).  When I pointed out that this did not seem reasonable, they said they would replace the two pounds of Fleishmann's yeast with a coupon for a 4-oz glass jar, and pointed out that I had complained about another product from their company in the past.  I was further told that I would not have any future defective products compensated for.  (?)  This is not a company that stands behind their products, and apparently they are not committed to a reasonable level of quality control.",1
"I've been Paleo for six months, as has my partner. We both found these inedible. All four kinds (which, by the way, taste nearly the same).<br /><br />I'm not sure what it is about them either. It seems like they would be good from the ingredients. But something about the combination of flavors just does not taste good. I kept trying them again, hoping that they would grow on me. They sure didn't. We finally tossed them.<br /><br />So, I would advise getting just one from a local co-op or something before you buy a whole bunch online. I sure which I had.",1
"Several people have commented on how well this yeast works as well as how economical it is so I won't be repetitive, I'll just wholeheartedly agree. The only thing I'm doing different is I'm freezing all of it and taking it out when I'm ready to bake. However, this is not the reason I purchased the yeast in the first place.<br />I have never had any problems with yeast bread until I recently started making my own bread. I had used a machine years ago with no adverse effect from the Fleischmann's yeast. When I decided to start making bread again, I wanted to challenge myself and try to do the kneading and the whole nine yards without the use of any machines, well except my mill, not into rock pounding grains:). Besides, it might prove to be a necessity someday. My problem was, no matter what bread I made, even very sweet cinnamon rolls or how well the bread came out, the smell of the yeast overwhelmed me and made me ill so much so that I couldn't even stand the smell of my house let alone stomach the bread. I would also taste the yeast for many hours later if I ate any of it. I could only surmise that I had developed some sort of allergy to it. I was pretty much beside myself, one because I had still had a good bit of Whole Grain wheat left & an expensive new mill but two because I could walk into Restaurants and bakeries and the smell of the yeast rolls baking made my mouth water. So what in the heck was wrong with the Fleischmann's? To my dismay, I couldn't find anyone else with a similar problem. So I studied many hours to learn how to make my own starters and even tried a friends Amish starter but bread did not get the raise I wanted nor the lightness. Neither am I a sourdough kind of girl & if I wanted cake, I would have made a cake, not bread want-to-be.  I wasn't ready to give up and thank goodness I didn't.<br />When I found this yeast, I was like why not, if it stinks, I can put it through my septic tank.<br />I made bread yesterday and to my delightful surprise it didn't make me sick, & I'm sure pouring it into jars stirred it up in the air a bit too. I halved the amount of yeast I used in the recipe, just to play it safe, and it did the job perfectly. I can't lie and say I thoroughly enjoyed the smell of the yeast, but the unpleasantness was minimal. I hope this doesn't change but at least for now, I can love my yeast breads again.",5
"Generally my cats all really like the Weruva flavors, but I won't order this one again, and will just get the regular chicken.  They eat around the liver pieces and leave them in the dish.",3
"The frozen hot chocolate is delicious. However, one of the 6 packets came damaged. I brought the issue to Serendipity's attention and they corrected the problem for me. I hope they take a look into the packaging so that the product is protected better in transit.",4
"this is by far my favorite loma linda product. if you are missing meatloaf  and dont want to take the time to make a vegetarian substitute, this product is amazing! only 5 WW points for 2 patties. i could eat this every day!!",5
Do not waste your time ordering. They never replied and never bothered to send the items. They did no answer my emails,1
"Since I've found the gluten-free breads in the market to be pricey, brick hard and barely palatable, I thought I'd give Namaste a try.  After all, it got rave reviews.<br /><br />The directions say to follow your manufacturer's recipe if you have a bread machine, so that's what I did......with a bit of modification as I just couldn't see wasting 3 perfectly good egg yolks (the recipe provided calls for 1 egg and 3 whites).  So I used all of the 4 eggs, but the mixture looked way too runny.  So I added 2/3 cup tapioca flour and 1/2 cup rice flour and VOILA!  The loaf turned out PERFECT - light, fluffy, very tasty.  None of the qualities of the flavorless bricks I'd been buying in the market. Had Namaste included the flour I had to add myself, I would have given it a 5-star review.",4
"The price is really good compared to the granola that I used to get from the farmer's market, however, it tastes....... just like some sort of organic waste.",3
My husband thinks these are some of the best store bought cookies he has ever tasted.,5
"This is one of the best kinds of GF pasta.<br />My only beef it that, after years of buying this in half-pound bags,  Tinkyada has suddenly downsized its packaging so you're paying more for less. A lot of food companies have done this downsizing, so just check what you're getting, because you might not be getting the deal you think you are!",3
"The jerky itself is very good quality. The only problem is how much pepper they load onto these pieces. It's so much that it burns my mouth and I can't even taste the jerky, all I can taste is strong pepper. Then it gets into the back of my throat and burns sometimes, or might get stuck in my teeth, all making for a very unpleasant experience!",3
"By far,this is the best flavored K cup coffee I've ever had. Good body, not bitter, no flowery aroma (like with the Green Mountain flavored K cups). I like my coffee a little stronger than Puck's Hawaiian Hazelnut, but it is certainly a fine, medium bodied,coffee I could drink over and over.",4
"While the smell is amazing, the taste is lacking compared to other Earl Gray Teas. This is the case for most of Teavana's teas, when your in the store they waft the smell of the tea toward you and your like WOW I bet that tastes amazing.... then you later taste it and its only ok... The Earl gray is not very traditional compared to other teas like Twinings and Harriods... Being from London and growing up on earl gray this tea is not horrible but there are better teas out there. Its seems like an American twist on an English classic, but if your like me and like that traditional English taste, this is not the way to go.",2
"This tea is not pleasant to drink. It has a bitter lemon taste that lingers in your mouth. Very dissapointed. Amazon WILL NOT take returns on Grocery items so please DO NOT BUY this item. EWWWW, YUCK.",1
As an aid to tranquility and sleep -- what it is marketed for -- it is not very effective.  But for chronic severe constipation it is the only thing that has worked for me.,5
"Unfortunately, Made in China. I do not trust their manufacturing standards.  Looking for an alternative....",1
"I've all but given up using citrus zest due to the benefits the oils.  While both have great flavor, orange oil is definately stronger (and goes further) than zest.  As it is a liquid, it does not add unwanted texture to your dish, either.  I use orange and lemon oils in my NY cheesecake and have always had terrific results.  The scent given to foods is stronger than with zest, too.  I love the stuff.  I just wish the bottles came with drop applicators.  (I've tried other lids with droppers inside, but the bottle opening doesn't fit them....  at least for the small 1 oz bottle.)",5
"Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies (raisin) fail the most important test of a cookie.  They are not delicious.  Considering they're 170 calories for ONE cookie you'd expect something decadent.  It's not even as tasty as an average cookie.<br /><br />A little bit dry considering it's supposed to be soft, moist cookie.  A slight sandy or grainy texture.  There's nothing foul or obnoxious about the taste - it's just nothing special.<br /><br />Nutritionally - ok for a cookie.  170 calories, 1.5g sat fat.  4g fiber!  (quite a bit.)  But I don't look at a cookie as some sort of health food.  A big* cookie like this should be an indulgence - a treat.  Instead it's not abhorrent.  If you start eating this, you'll finish it.  But you won't go out of your way for another one.<br /><br />*not THAT big.  It's not like a famous amos or something.",2
"This product did not give desired results. I have chemically relaxed hair, that is around my shoulder blades. I felt that my hair was not particularly nourished after using both this shampoo and conditioner. However, I am used to the results from more expensive products, so maybe you just get what you pay for. The price is reasonable, just don't expect your hair to feel luxuriously moisturized.",3
"We use ketchup packets in our lunches.  It takes several months to use up a box.  According to Heinz, the shelf life of ketchup packets is 7 months. The product I received is 6 months old.  I will have to donate it to a food bank. This is a good product, but not fresh enough for extended use. I will purchase at GFS after this. I am very disappointed.",1
No thanks.  Kind of bitter and has slight overtone of cardboard.  Organic Bold and Donut Shop are still our faves.,2
"These dog biscuits are just the right size for a dog treat and my dogs love them.  I feel good that they have healthy ingredients and are grain free.  My only complaint after ordering several boxes and several orders, is that sometimes the biscuits arrive in the box whole and unbroken, and sometimes they arrive totally broken up into little pieces.  If another shipment arrives in broken up little pieces, then I probably won't order them again.",4
Not what I was expecting and will not order again. I was looking for dried fruit. This product was powdery and what wasn't was hard.,2
"Based on the average review, I decided to try this coffee because I was hoping to find a better decaf hazelnut than the Green Mountain which tends to be a little weak.  The taste was not appealing at all and it had a syrupy quality to it.  I do not recommend this product and now I am stuck with a lot of coffee I'll never use.",2
"My husband absolutely loves these and I was thrilled to find them on Amazon for such a great price. However, the product pictured is a bag, but mine arrived in 3 boxes of 10 packets each.  Not a bad thing, just different from what is pictured/described. I deducted one star though, because I'd prefer if one packet made more.",4
"We love the pouch size and the price but this baby food Is sour, although the banana and pumpkin should be sweet components. The color of the puree is a light yellow and not orange as it appears on the box. There is no pumpkin taste. Lemon juice concentrate and citric acid have been added therefore the predominant taste is sour banana.<br />Ingredients: organic banana, organic pumpkin, organic lemon juice from concentrate, citric acid. The composition list is different than on the company's website.",2
"You need a pod maker capable of making this.  Maybe I'm a retard but I didn't know that based on the vine description.  Doesn't smell all that great.<br /><br />Honestly none of the instant coffees are any good, just get up 5 minutes earlier and make a pot of real coffee, hello.",2
"This is basically the same technology as Starbucks VIA (whether it tastes better or worse is your call - I don't like VIA; this stuff is OK but not great.)  It's essentially freeze-dried instant coffee (that's the ""soluble"" part) mixed with ultrafine coffee powder to give it more body... and to leave that little extra dust in the bottom of your cup and grit between your teeth.<br /><br />The actual box does tell you - but you won't figure it out from the listing here on Amazon unless you read the reviews, so I'm pretty irritated.  It's a decent price for real coffee, but it's actually pretty damn expensive for instant.<br /><br />Now, as for what really matters: flavor.  It's actually not terrible; it reminds me of Douwe Egberts toddy coffee - full body and a fairly rich, mild flavor.<br /><br />The medium roast Grove Square is better than the Dark, IMO, and the Dark is a lot grittier in your mouth.<br /><br />Would not have bought this stuff if the listing had been up-front; will not buy again.",2
"If you want a a fruit basket about the right size for one person, this is a nice choice. It was shipped and received in about three business days and the recipient said the fruit was good - although it needed to sit on the counter to ripen a bit.",4
"What can I say, I just blew my wad with the title for my review.<br />It's been ssssoooo many years....",5
"I, too, think the 25% price increase for Big Easy Bold is out of line.  But I disagree that the increase in the commodity price of coffee can justify it.  The overall amount of coffee in k-cups is not large enough to have driven such a big increase.  My other favorite k-cups are going up ""only"" 16%.  I don't get it, and I'm not buying it... even though I enjoy the product.  I, too, cancelled my order.  So 1 star for the sticker shock!",1
"I was really hoping to get a really great nutritious & delicious snack for my family when I ordered this product.  I was really disappointed.<br /><br />The packaging is really good looking and I had high hopes, so when I opened the package to my chips, I expected something great.  I ordered the Chili Lime flavor and, since, I have had higher-fat chili lime chips in the past, I'd knew that I would love them.<br />First, they don't really look like what they appear to be on the packaging (no big deal though).<br />I took a bite out of the first chip and it had a really funny texture and strange flavor.  So, I looked on the back where it showed the ingredients and I was pretty surprised--it had a LOT of chemicals in the product.  Also, AND THIS REALLY FREAKED ME OUT, the main ingredient is not a sliced potato, but, ""potato ingredients (potato flakes, potato starch)"".  In other words, it's made of instant mashed potatoes!<br /><br />I thought the taste was funny and the ingredients curious.  However, there are no transfats or saturated fats in the chips (that's why I gave it 2-stars).<br /><br />All in all, I would rather pack my kids lunches with a bag of Lay's or Kettle chips than give them these chips.<br /><br />All The Best.",2
The Chai Tea is way too sweet and I love sweets!! But you just can't get passed the extreme sweetness of this tea. I reduced the mix of concentration to milk. I mix 1/3 parts to 1/4 parts instead of 1/2 parts (1/2 mix and 1/2 milk is instructed ) of this stuff with my milk in a cup and it is still way more sweet to spice. I can barely taste spices in this tea. I love Chai Tea I prefer Good Earth  Vanilla Chai. This does not do Chai Tea justice! If you want to just drink straight sugar and liquid then get this stuff. You would have to down a nice glass of water to quench the thirst this drink gives you after you drink it. It is so sweet that it makes you thirsty even with less mix added than directed. It is like sweet tea rather than chai tea,2
The sauce brought me right back to my trips to Jamaica...everything I remembered & tasted. I recommend it to anyone who wants a kick in their food,4
I got this through a Decaf Keurig assortment pack (also from amazon) and while I have enjoyed all of the flavors - thisone was so weak - I had to post a review.,2
"THis was a fun way to sample new flavors (and revisit old favs). When I saw how nicely it was packaged, I realized I probably paid more than my regular Kcup box but I wrote it off in the name of experimentation.  Would have given it 5 stars but they threw in 3 decaf cups. SERIOUSLYY??  That was just annoying.  Otherwise, fun to have variety without committing to a big box.",4
"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!",1
"I love this sea salt & vinegar flavor from Kettle.  When I saw this one on the daily deal here for $17.99/case, I put my order without doubt.  However, when I received the case, I found out that the whole case is expiring in December while I got it at the end of August.  I tried one package and I can definitely taste the unfreshness in the chips.  I was disappointed and then I found out this item is not returnable!  How convenient!  Although I love this chips, I won't order from here again with the concern of close expiration date...",3
"I bought my Hellmann's mayonnaise at the local grocery (Indiana), expiry date April 2012.  It was also bad when opened - it tasted super-vinegary and just ""off,"" and I have been using Hellmann's for many years.  I don't know if they have changed the formula or what, but I threw out a much-anticipated BLT sandwich because I had put Hellmann's on it.  If they have changed the recipe, they REALLY need to go back to the old one.  I won't ruin any more family recipes by using Hellmann's if they don't.",1
"This product is not the best tasting tea I tried.  It tends to have an overwhelming, strong flavor of cloves.",2
"I have mixed feelings about this product.  We have ordered it three times now through subscribe and save.  With the first order, we were 100% satisfied.  The coconut milk had a beautiful taste and texture.  With the second box, the quality of the product was just gross.  Coconut ""milk"" is absolutely the wrong word.  At least 80% of the can was solidified.  When I shook the can, I could hear no movement of liquid whatsoever.  I already had a few cans of coconut cream in the cupboard and didn't need a dozen more!  I continued to use it since the flavor was fine and I didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning it.  With our third order (what can I say, I'm an optimist!), there were still some solids but much less than our second order.<br /><br />It does not seem to matter whether the box states it originated in Thailand.  All three of our orders said they were from Thailand, yet they were of drastically different quality.",3

I ordered this as the price was certainly right (6 1lb cans for less than $30) and the reviews were good.<br /><br />This is certainly a step up in the hot cocoa market. Better than just about anything you can find in the supermarket. I certainly prefer hot chocolate - but it can be time-consuming to make and it's tough to heat milk and melt chocolate at work or in class.<br /><br />This is the perfect compromise for when you want that chocolate drink and aren't in a position to 'do it right'.<br /><br />Very good taste and dissolves well. I always use a little more than it says on the can - with some cocoa that means it won't all dissolve - this is not a problem here.<br /><br />Certainly recommended.,4
"It's official! These are my new favorite cookies! You indulge yourself with a piece of heaven every time you have a bite....So crispy, so perfect, and the smell of the chocolate is oh sooo yummy!!!!",5
"This Marley Coffee has a beautiful strong aroma before brewing, like fresh ground beans, I am amazed it smells so good and strong then brews up very mild, almost weak, but that sounds like a negative and that's not what I mean, I drink a lot of coffee and have for years and love a strong brew most the time, this coffee is so mild I can drink it plain. I usually like a splash of cream, or lately a dab of honey.  So I give it a four, because it may not be as strong as I like but comes in individual packets so stays fresh, portable for my frequent camping/hiking trips, brews up to a taste that can be sipped plain, and organic with a amazing pre-brew aroma.",4
"Not so healthy! 420 calories per cookie, Ouch!! buy a case and get fat, that's for sure.<br />Totally not worth the added on pounds, you can find vegan non gluten cookies at your local food co-op or trader joes for half those calories..",2
"The product description says, ""assertive, dark, smoky fragrance and flavor"" and they ain't kiddin'!!!  It barely tastes like tea at all... more like they took a cloth, let it hang in campfire smoke for a week, soaked it in hot water and wrung it out into my mug.  Seriously!<br /><br />I've tried taking half of a pinch of this and adding to other tea leaves when I brew a pot. That turns out pretty good.  But straight? You'd better like wood smoke!",1
"I didn't realize that it had so much artificial color in it and mineral oil. These are things I try to stay away from. However, I have used the product for about a week now. I plan to throw it out.  I really haven't seen any difference other than my scalp itching like crazy and green residue everywhere. I am disappointed that it is not an all natural product.",2
"This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one. We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt, but I want to say that this has a ""rounded"" flavor meaning it isn't harsh or distinctive on food, rather it seems to become part of the food, going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way. Sounds silly, but I am learning good quality ingredients really make a difference.",5
"My dogs absolutely love Pedigree, as do my cats too!  There is nothing left over!  And it is so healthy for all of the too!",5
"This is Crap. There's no apples in it. This is a waste of money, I bought three boxes, tasted one k-cup, poured  it out and tossed the remaining boxes in the garbage. I didn't even want to give it away to anyone in fears they would never speak to me again. This is no comparison to Naturals apple cider, which I constantly buy and drink every night, well almost every night.",1
"When I started drinking Sparkling Ice, I was really excited, I told all my friends about this new found jewel. Well my excitement was short lived. This drink, sparkles all over the place...uhhh. What i'm saying is that it is so carbonated that you have to make sure you open the same bottle with caution everytime you want to drink it, otherwise it will explode all over your clothes, books etc, which I experienced. I was so mad I thought I may like the taste but lm not going to be on the edge each time I want to open a bottle I have already been drinking from. Its like you cannot afford to be distracted if you want to drink Sparkling Ice that's for sure....",1
"My family and I enjoy the salt & vinegar chips that lays makes as well as the kettle cooked chips, so we wanted to try these chips because we've seen them all over the market. i took a chance and purchased them online on amazon and I regret taking that the chance. We do not like the dry and more on the salty taste of these chips. I will no longer make purchases on items that I can try buying at the store first before investing in buying by bulk and saving online. Do not purchase these chips unless you already tried them before.",1
There is very little Mericle-Gro in this bottle. Not worth the price. Go to K-Mart and buy the large box.,2
"Got my peppers from ThinkGeek, the ones that came in my can were not Ghost Peppers, they were Capsicum Annuum. Same can tho.<br />The plants are quite healthy tho, got them in a gallon pot.",2
"I love the mango macadamia nut flavor. It's sweet with a little crunch, plus vitamin D and calcium. And great also since it's gluten and dairy free. The only reason I give 4 out of 5 stars is that I cannot eat most flavors since I cannot eat almonds. I'm hoping someday there will be more almond-free flavors.",4
"Ok Funley's keep doing whatever it is you are doing!!!<br /><br />I can't get enough of these treats, thank goodness they are individually wrapped.  My only dilemma is deciding which I love more the caramel, peanut butter or the original.<br /><br />I first saw you on QVC and could not have been any happier I decided to try these treats out, just wish I could have controlled myself so they lasted longer. But I learned a valuable lesson ""Buy in Bulk"" lol.<br /><br />My advice is getting a variety pack and then decide for yourself, but warning it is in no way an easy decision.<br /><br />Thank you Funley's!!!",5
The order was not packaged as shown.  The product was ordered with the intended use as party favors for my child's first birthday.  The pops were thrown together in a ziplock bag and shipped in a box with no packaging material.  Only 1/4 of the order was usable due to breakage.  Steer clear of this item unless you wish to be disappointed.,1
"It's coconut flavored, either you'll like it or not.  I was actually surprised since I'm not a big fan of coconut, but I liked this coffee.  Not my favorite, but nice on occasion.",3
"I purchased the pack of five for $23.59. what i got was one pack for 12.99.  when i went back to the site, i clicked on the pack of five and it took me to the page to order, but it didn't have the pack of five highlighted so i got the other.  i should have spotted that, but it was down lower than the screen.  it had the right type of cookie highlighted so i assumed(my favorite word)everything was correct.  this is the first time this has happened.  they need to fix this.  who would buy one package of cookies for almost half the cost of a pack of five.",1
"Well, I am going to be a bit contrary to the higher ratings given this tea. By no means am I a tea expert, but I drink more cups of green tea in a day than the law allows.  I have tried a large variety of teas: green, black, oolong, white..... the list goes on. The vast majority of my tea consumption is  green tea, definitely my preference over black teas, though I do like oolong. I tried my first cup of Mr. Lee's Organic Green Tea today, it sits to the left of my keyboard at the moment as I type this review. When I removed the teabags from the box to put in my air tight canister, out of habit I sniffed the collection of tea bags, curious of the aroma. It was a familiar smell, basically the same ""fragrance"" as I have noticed in many previous boxes of green tea brands such as Lipton, Salada, Carrington, Prince of Peace, etc. I popped my cup of tap water into the microwave and while waiting for the water to heat up, I admired the tidy plastic wrapper which had enveloped the tea bag. I dropped the tea bag into the hot water, allowed the tea to brew, a familiar aroma arose from the cup of tea, again the same aroma as the previous mentioned teas. The first sip, BITTER, what a disappointment. And the bitterness lingers, objectionable bitterness. I found the tea to be quite bland, void of any nice flavors that would elevate this tea to nice aromatic status.  But, hey, the price was right and I liked the individually wrapped teabags, that's why I gave it three stars. But price and clever wrappings do not a good cup of green tea make. To date, my favorite affordable everyday tea is Sencha, Japanese green tea packaged and marketed by Yamamotoyama Tea. Give it a try, you might like it too! I prefer the loose tea style as opposed to individual tea bags, loose tea is a bit ""greener"", more earth friendly, omitting the tea bags and wrappers.",3
"I really want to like this cereal. It reminds me of the hot mush my grandma used to make which was a mixture of oatmeal, cream of wheat, and wheatena. The texture is excellent, not at all gluey like pure oatmeal. Mixed with maple syrup and yogurt I was very very pleased.<br /><br />However there is one problem you need to know. This cereal has a slight bitter aftertaste when you don't add anything to it or mix it with anything. I am not quite sure what it is due to, and I can't taste the bitterness if I mix it with a good amount of honey, or brown sugar, or butter or maple syrup. However if you like to eat your cereal without any sweetening added at all then I think it is not the right cereal for you.<br /><br />I think if you mix this hot cereal with other cereals it will improve their texture and you probably wont notice the aftertaste.",4
"I wish I had know that this product was changed in a very significant way. We were buying the freeze dried liver for training treats. It was real liver, diced into small pieces that were easy to transport and carry. The product now, with the misleading description of ""ceter cut"", is processed liver that has been stamped out. It is soft and extremely crumbly, and is reduced to powder in my pockets in no time. Comparison of the empty container with this new one showed no difference at all except for an adhesive label placed on the cover over the old one. I called the company to ask about the product change; the rep explained they changed the product to the processed one and said customer feedback indicates people don't like it. She said the regular, natural liver is still made, and is available at a national chain pet store, but not on Amazon. She kept apologizing, and was unable to explain to me why a correct description is not on the container; at this price, I would have appreciated a coupon toward the regular product at the pet store, since I have a 3/4 tub of the crumbly stuff that I can't use. I wish Amazon would carry the ""old"" product also, with an accurate description. Based on what she said, that is the product with the customer following.",2
"candy was old. Paper stuck to the candies. Also, all the candy was faded....basically I got a box from 10 years ago",1
This coffee is surprisingly good. I'm no connoisseur but for the bucks you can't beat the quality. Enjoying some now. Recommended!,4
"When I opened this alot of the tea sacks were broken and the tea emptied out and spilled everywhere. I steeped some inside my cup and noticed that all sorts of the tea leaves had come out (I even took a picture and posted it under customer pics) and when I sipped my drink, tea leave crumbs got inside my mouth! I havent noticed any effect from the tea though but I have only used it for a few days so maybe it takes awhile. However, if they'd be able to keep the sacks closed that would help alot!",2
"Personally I have always preferred splenda over equal or sweet n low.<br /><br />I do believe that using a sweetener as opposed to just regular cane sugar is healthier for you. Even though there are some people that would disagree with that.<br /><br />Regardless, I like it and like this product. However, I couldn't really taste any difference in it from my regular splenda. I like  that it has antioxidants though, so since I already like splenda to begin with and since this has no difference in taste, I will be buying this one from now on for it's a bit more healthier than the original.",4
The gum was out of date but i didn't notice it until my family had already chewed 2 packs But I was able to return even without the two packs,3
"The presentation was good, but I gave this as gifts last year and my sister who got one of the boxes said the tea is beautiful but tastes ""weedy"" rather than like real tea.  I tried some and agree.<br /><br />Not sure if it was just a bad batch, or if we have discriminatory tastes.  I usually drink Stash teas and my sister drinks Bigelow & CS teas.",2
"Great flavor.  Just enough spice.  A love Chai Tea Latte flavor also, but this is nice when you feel like something lighter.  I will purchase more!",4
"this stuff is ok.  I was hoping it was the flakes but it's a very fine powder, like a flour consistency.  Which makes it kinda turn pasty when sprinkled on veggies or sprinkled on popcorn.  The taste isn't bad, not really great either, but not bad.  I think the yeast flakes would be better, more texture.  But since it only comes in the 3 bottle package, I have 3 bottles to get through now before I can buy the flakes!  If you're not sure you'll like it, try to find it in a single bottle first.",3
"I got a variety of flavors, but for the amount of shipping charged, they could have been better packaged. In addition some of the flavors were great, like root beer, others vile, like the chemical-tasting watermelon.<br />In hot humid weather it is also really hard to get them out of the wrapper. You can put them in the fridge for a while, but unless you are working on craft or cookery projects or run a store, don't buy in bulk in warmer months or if you live in warmer climates.",3
"Unfortunately, I did not enjoy the flavor of this candy very much in the beginning but ended up eating them anyway. I would still recommend this product to others.",2
"I haven't even tried this stuff yet, but with the first ingredient being salt, the second being MSG, then finally the third being dried bonito powder, then the next sugar, then dextrose(more sugar)...then some chemicals(disodium inosinate, disodium succinate), which sound like more salt or preservatives, or both...WTF? None of the other reviews even mention this marvelous combination of lousy ingredients...kinda stupid. If I'd wanted 3 packets of sugar, salt, and flavor enhancers....I'd have ordered salty/sugared MSG soup base.<br /><br />UPDATE: I did some research and I thought this was interesting, and since this product, and the topic of MSG seems to be so bantered about, maybe this will be interesting to someone else.<br /><br />The food additive, monosodium glutamate, was first used in the United States in any quantity in the late 1940s. According to Dr. George Schwartz, author of In Bad Taste: The MSG Syndrome, although considerable effort had been spent to introduce MSG to the USA, little had been accomplished prior to World War II. However, sometime during the war, the use of MSG in Japanese soldiers' rations was noticed. In 1948, a symposium on MSG, presided over by the Chief Quartermaster of the Armed Forces, was held in Chicago for members of the food industry.<br />By the 1960s, Accent, the leading brand of the flavor enhancer called ""monosodium glutamate,"" had become a household word. Simultaneously, other hydrolyzed protein products such as autolyzed yeast, sodium caseinate, and hydrolyzed vegetable protein gained in popularity. Every hydrolyzed protein product, regardless of the name given to it on a label, contains MSG.<br />Although glutamic acid had been isolated in 1866 by the German chemist Karl Ritthausen, it was not until 1908 that its flavor-enhancing potential was noticed by Kikunae Ikeda of Tokyo, Japan. Prior to that time, the Japanese had used seaweed as a favorite flavor enhancer, without understanding that glutamic acid was its flavor-enhancing component.<br />From 1910 until 1956, the process underlying production of glutamic acid and ""monosodium glutamate"" in Japan was one of extraction, a slow and costly method. Elsewhere, crude gluten or other starting materials were hydrolyzed by heating with hydrochloric acid. In 1956, the Japanese succeeded in producing glutamic acid by means of fermentation; and after considerable research to identify suitable strains of microorganisms for starting the requisite cultures, large-scale production of glutamic acid and ""monosodium glutamate"" through fermentation began.<br />Even before the Japanese discovered the flavor potential of processed free glutamic acid extracted from sea weed, the potential of freeing glutamic acid from protein using acid hydrolysis was being explored in Europe. At the time, however, the method was not widely used. Indeed, it was not until some time later that the flavor industry realized that various of their hydrolyzed protein products contained considerable amounts of processed free glutamic acid (MSG) -- the flavor-enhancing component of the food ingredient ""monosodium glutamate"" -- and production of hydrolyzed protein products for their flavor-enhancing potential escalated.<br />When ""monosodium glutamate"" was brought to the United States in the years following World War II it was still manufactured through extraction. By 1956, after considerable research to identify suitable strains of microorganisms for starting the requisite cultures, Ajinomoto Co., Inc. had succeeded in producing glutamic acid through a method of bacterial fermentation wherein bacteria (some, if not all of which are genetically modified)(10) are grown aerobically in a liquid nutrient medium. These bacteria have the ability to synthesize glutamic acid outside of their cell membranes and excrete it into the medium to accumulate there.(11) It was in 1956 that truly large-scale production of glutamic acid and ""monosodium glutamate"" through fermentation began.<br />We find it fascinating that the first published report of a reaction to ""monosodium glutamate"" did not appear until ""monosodium glutamate"" was being made by bacterial fermentation. The first published report of a reaction to ""monosodium glutamate"" appeared in 1968 when Robert Ho Man Kwok, M.D., who had emigrated from China, reported that although he never had the problem in China, about 20 minutes into a meal at certain Chinese restaurants, he suffered numbness, tingling, and tightness of the chest that lasted for approximately 2 hours.<br />The following year, John W. Olney, M.D. reported that laboratory animals suffered brain lesions and neuroendocrine disorders after being exposed to monosodium glutamate. Scientists studying retinal degeneration in mice treated with free glutamic acid had noted that these mice became grotesquely obese. Olney, who speculated that the obesity might be a sign of damage to the hypothalamus (the area of the brain that regulates a number of endocrine functions, including weight control), found that infant laboratory animals given free glutamic acid suffered brain damage immediately, and assorted neuroendocrine disorders later in life. Pharmaceutical grade L-glutamic acid was often used to produce these disorders until neuroscientists observed that monosodium glutamate, an inexpensive food additive, could be substituted for laboratory-grade free glutamic acid in these studies and produce the same effects.<br />In the years that followed, neuroscientists replicated the work of Olney, and Olney spoke out repeatedly about the toxic potential of monosodium glutamate. In 1972, for example, Olney testified before the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs that ingestion of MSG places humans at risk, with the greatest risk being for the very young; and that a National Academy of Science panel organized to determine whether MSG ought to be banned from baby food had produced an ""industry arranged whitewash"" by a group of scientists with almost no experience in neuropathology. In the early 1970s, manufacturers of baby food voluntarily removed the monosodium glutamate from their products, but replaced the monosodium glutamate with MSG-containing ingredients such as autolyzed yeast and hydrolyzed vegetable protein. In the late 1970s, manufacturers ""voluntarily"" removed all obvious MSG-containing ingredients from baby food.<br />Use of MSG in food has grown in the last 30 years and is still growing. MSG is found in most soups, salad dressings, processed meats, frozen entrees, ice cream, and frozen yogurt, in some crackers, bread, canned tuna, and very often in ""low fat"" and ""no fat"" foods to make up for flavor lost when fat is reduced or eliminated. It can be found in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and dietary supplements. It is found in enteral feeding products and in infant formula. It is found in vaccines -- including vaccines used on children. It is found in hospitals where it is hidden in the jello, chicken soup, and some IV solutions given to very sick patients.<br />Very often manufacturers use hydrolyzed protein products as MSG-containing flavor enhancers instead of using ""monosodium glutamate."" In the industry, an ingredient that contains MSG but is not necessarily recognized by consumers as containing MSG is called a ""clean label"" ingredient.",2
"I've tried almost every pocky flavor there is to try and if not mistaken, milk chocolate is the original pocky flavor.  In the range of pocky this falls straight in the middle, perhaps slightly over to the + side. I want to say the cookie type pretzel stick is virtually tasteless.  You wouldn't want to eat it alone.  The chocolate is smooth and not very sweet, which I like. Pocky also has a nice snap to them which satisfies the crunch addict me. If you've never tried a Pocky and don't know where to begin, I recommend starting at the beginning with milk chocolate.  (3.5 stars)<br /><br />By the way, don't forget to try my favorite, almond pocky.  The grade of chocolate is better so usually they cost more.  I think they're geared towards adults.  The banana dessert pocky is pretty good, too.",3
"I only gave this a 4 instead of a 5 because I prefer a robust and gritty coffee.  This was a light and smooth flavored coffee.  It was easy to drink and would be an acceptable coffee to the majority of casual coffee drinkers.  I could not taste the floral or exotic berry that the package promised but that did not matter to me.  I feel good that this is a fair trade coffee but all of the packaging makes this product not too environmentally friendly.  Overall, I would buy this coffee for a reasonable price but would serve it to guests who do not prefer my type of coffee.",4
"I can make my cats do the silliest things to get these. I like to put cardboard boxes around the living room and toss treats into them at random. The cats will leap into the boxes, gobble the treat and then leap out waiting to hear where the next one will go. It's pretty dang entertaining. They sure don't do this for anything else. Something about these treats drives the cats crazy and I love it.",5
"These have better than average broth, but less than average noodles. The decent powdered soup mix is not enough to make me want to buy such plain, tasteless noodles. The ramen seems like plain flour with water, poor texture and pasty, bland flavor.<br /><br />Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Vegan Miso Ramen, in Cups (on Amazon) has a better ramen noodle. I have found nothing as tasty (and vegetarian) since Westbrae stopped making delicious brown rice ramen, buckwheat ramen, etc..<br /><br />(Anyone know another good, vegetarian ramen?)",2
"I just received my shipment of this mochi yesterday and it tasted weird, not good at all. For clarification, I got the red bean and it comes with six in the package (I couldn't find anywhere how many were inside). I ate the first one, didn't like it, tried another and then threw the rest away. I'll stick to my Kohaku kind, just figured I would try out another brand now I know better.",2
"I normally drink only Donut Shop, but when I saw this on sale I thought I would give it a try.  I was quite impressed with it and really enjoy this one.  I have now added it to my list of favorite K-cups to buy.",5
"this one is not as HOT as the others, but its real good too.  I meant to order another kind, but accidently order this (my fault) and I'm glad I did.",5
"Understand that its a diet drink before you buy. That said, it's very good. I find it flavorful and satisfying. Not sure why some say it's weak. It's a great cup of hot cider with only ten calories and it smells amazing! Like a Yankee candle every time I brew a cup. Satisfied buyer here. In fact, I've talked myself into a cup right now. Mmmm.",4
NATURAL CALM is a great relaxing magnesium supplement.  This product will balance your calcium intake and restore healthy magnesium levels. This product also helps reduce stress after a hard days work!  Use as derected.,4
"I've been searching for a no-corn natural dog food to keep skin rashes away...tried Halo which was great but so expensive.  This is a little more affordable and the ingredient list looks very similar to Halo, but....oh boy.  I'm just glad it's warm enough to have the windows open!  My dog loves the taste and the quality seems great, so we'll try 2 more days to see if things settle down.",3
"As all Hi-chews are, the melon flavor is very chewy and juicy. However, if you do not like melon flavor, this is not for you. It actually tastes like a mix between honeydew and cantaloupe, but more honeydew than cantaloupe. I knew I wasn't going to like it when a friend gave me some, but I tried it and it tasted exactly how I thought it was going to taste. So just a heads up to those exploring new flavors, this one may not be fore you.",4
"I saw this in Bevmo when I was wandering around, and I thought it was interesting. How can black water NOT spike someones interest?<br /><br />I went back today to buy a bottle, just to test it out. After letting it sit in the fridge to get nice and cold, I closed my eyes and took a gulp. It was disgusting. It doesn't feel like water, it seems thicker, almost greasy going down. It tastes coppery like you have blood in your mouth. It smells like your hands do after you handle a large amount of change. Sure, it seems healthy and all, but the taste isn't something I'd be able to deal with. It's just gross.<br /><br />To each their own, though. Maybe someone else would like it.",1
"I see that there are a lot of reviews complaining that there is a new recipe for this product and that it's not as good as the old one. Unfortunately, I haven't tried the ""old"" recipe so I can't make a comparison. The box I received says ""Classic Recipe"" so it may be that they have gone back to the old recipe? I'm not sure.<br /><br />I made this oatmeal with milk and found it to average. I don't mind eating it but I've had better. Even though sugar is second on the ingredient list, I didn't think that this oatmeal had a very sweet taste. I could just barely taste brown sugar and I couldn't taste a maple flavor at all. If I'm going to eat something with a lot of added sugar then I want it to taste sweet! This was very filling and kept me full until lunch time.",3
"Yes, I did smell the vanilla (and even saw it) when I opened the bag and pour the contents out. However, once the coffee was made, the taste was a disappointment to myself. Perhaps I got used to another coffee which was much more to my liking. In any case, not only did this coffee taste bitter to me, but the vanilla taste was weaker than I expected (again, this is in comparison to another vanilla-flavored coffee I've had, which gave me a stronger vanilla ""experience""). This Starbucks product is pretty strong coffee (the instructions tell you to use 2 TBS of ground coffee for 6 ounces of water) and to my taste - seems quite bitter if I follow their instructions. However, once I add some milk to it, the bitterness is masked somewhat - but I would not drink this black if I have a choice. Personally, I would not buy it myself or recommend this product to a friend.",1
"I was not crazy about this version of Kay's naturals, but my husband did like the Barbeque ones, now even he doesn't like them. The new formula is TERRIBLE. Crumbs all over the bottom of the bag and not crispy at all.<br /><br />In addition to this they have downsized the quantity without notifying us.<br />They used to be 1.5oz and are still advertised as that. But they are actually only 1.2oz now. That's 3.6 ounces missing when you buy 12 packages.<br /><br />The vendor has agreed to reimburse me a small amount on these due to the unadvertised size difference but the product is so terrible now, I will be removing them from subscribe and save all together.",1
"Arrived a day early, they taste great & they are very fresh. Will buy again because my family loves them too.",5
"I'm happy for getting these as a deal, but i wont say it tasted AMAZING. it was decent, and no regrets.",4
"Well... they taste amazing!  Nothing like diet food.  Probably because it really isn't all that ""diet-y.""  It is just extremely portion controlled.  If you need extra packaging to keep you from eating a lot of dessert, this is great for you.  However, if you are looking for something ""diet-y"" but fills you up or lasts you through a movie, you may want to look elsewhere or you'll end up eating the entire box.<br /><br />Overall, it is delicious for those nights when I am full from a big meal filled with lots of onions and/or garlic and am craving something sweet (why must I have chocolate after onions and garlic?).",4
This is my favorite dried noodles in a cup/bowl. The veggies are actually good and I really like the flavor. The only thing slightly better I think is Annie Chun's where the noodles don't start completely dry.,5
"I like lime and I like chili so I figured this would be a pretty tasty nut. It is definitely very flavorful but the lime overpowers the chili so much that the chili might as well be nonexistent. So if you are a lime lover you will probably enjoy this flavor, otherwise you might want to try one of the other varieties instead.  Personally I will finish up this batch but once they're gone I will go back to my habanero bbq and wasabi.",3
"Very good on fish, does not overpower, but lends a nice light flavor - a bit expensive, but good as a treat or a gift!",5
"We bought the large ball for our power-chewing 30lb cattle dog mix, and this product was AWESOME for the first two weeks. She just chewed and chewed and was happy as can be, it kept her occupied for at least an hour each treat... but then she figured out how to pop the treats out (no joke, she wedges her tooth under the edge and just eases them out), now the treats barely last 15 minutes because she just chews a bit and swallows them. They're just too expensive to give her anymore. Luckily you can still shove small bits of dog food into the center, and she still plays with the ball but that game doesn't last very long either. Great product and really durable, as long as your dog doesn't outsmart it!",3
"I tried this flavor of coffee pods as a change of pace but I don't love it.  It's ok, but not my favorite.",3
My cats love it.  It is the only moist cat food they will eat.  It is safe and convenient for me to use.  I alternate with the Poultry variety pack.,5
My cairn terrier Daisy loves these basted bones. Having trouble<br />finding them in retail. I hope its not a sign that the product<br />is discontinued. She also likes the peanut butter basted flavor.,5
"My 2 cats are picky tuna lovers and this was all that was available at the time. They still love this, but the smelly fish scent is very strong and the kitchen smells for a bit after they eat it. They still love it. But I don't like the smell. I'd buy it again if there was no other choice. But if there is tuna, I'd go for that instead.",3
"This tasted great, but i dont think the food coloring is necessary and this product made my stomach hurt very badly and it gave me diarrhea. no thanks.",1
"I have two cats and with the price of cat food going up like everything else, I jumped on the opportunity to buy this food during a lightening round offer. Unfortunately I should have consulted with the cats! One cat eats everything quickly and ravenously. The other is only anxious to eat Wellness Healthy Indulgence and Fancy Feast Gourmet Wild Salmon. Expensive tastes, so when this healthy variety was offered at 1/2 price I took it. I was truly surprised to see the good eater turn around from the bowl and leave. The slow eater did stay and work on it. I may end up donating these to the local shelter in my area, hopefully some cat there will enjoy it.",3
I was disappointed when I received the package of Freeze-Dried Zucchini because it is smaller than pictured (by about one-half)and there are no directions how to reconstitute or ideas for use.,4
"I was expecting two packs of these like the description said, instead I only got one box.  It was a total rip off.",1
"Used to eat these as a child.  Cookies are good, nice that they are small group packs within the box - excellent stocking stuffers.  Brings back memories, the ones I got on sale especially were due to expire within the year.",4
"not what i expected.. I tried vanilla version at my neighbour's - they were soft and nice.. but they were also in a bigger bag (8 oz or so). These cookies (oatmeal) come in small pouches (2 oz or so) and they are stone hard, too salty, no taste appeal whatsoever. The same I can say for the chocolate version. Nobody in our family wants a bite of them - waste of money.",1
These Licorice Wheels are OK.  Maybe I expected them to be sweeter - like the Twizzler brand.  But they're not.,3
"We eat jerky all the time- backpacking, for snacks, just a convenience food! This, however, had a different texture that we didn't like. We ate it, but wouldn't buy it again.",2
"I got these because I have heard about them from a lot of breastfeeding Moms. I used them for a month and noticed a very tiny increase in my supply, but for the entire month my baby pooped 6-8 times a day. She was fussy and always blowing out her diapers. I didn't make the connection at first and then decided to stop taking them, after a day she went back to pooping normally and wasn't as fussy.<br />I was taking 2 capsules, 3 times a day. I barely noticed an increase in supply and it made my daughter very gassy and uncomfortable. I was really hoping this would help but it just didn't work for me.",2
"I tried these after reading all the great reviews.  While the taste is pleasant, the flakes and the little fiber sticks get soggy very fast.  Because of that, I tend to eat the cereal too fast which takes away from enjoying the flavor.  I much prefer Nature's Path Heritage Flakes (they stay very crunchy and the taste is vastly superior) and will stick with those in the future.",2
"This stuff does not taste like black licorice or sweet in any way to me.  It tastes kind of like thick, nasty soy sauce.  I can't see how anyone could take 3 tablespoons a week of this.  I barely managed to swallow the teaspoon I put in my mouth.  We eat very healthy and not much sugar but my tastebuds say ""no way!"" to this stuff.  It does have 70% of your daily iron so I will make some attempts to hide this in something else- though I really can't imagine what right now.<br /><br />In addition, the cap was not on tightly when the package arrived and the black goo had leaked out into into the packaging.  They did have it wrapped securely in bubble wrap though, so it only got on that.  Still, not pleasant to have to clean the container before I could open it.",2
What they show and what they send have only a slight resemblance.  More than half the items pictured were not included in the box we received.  You are paying a high price for the assortment but if you are interested in trying any specific blends don't count on getting them just because they say they are included.,1
"I bought a 40 sampler pack from the caveman bakery website. It's not exactly like a cookie consistency however the texture and chewiness of the cookie I like. They kind of remind me of like those natural nut and fruit bars, like kind or something. Of the ones I've tried, Alpine and Tropical are my favorites mainly because alpine has hazelnut and tropical has a coconut taste in it. The least favorite that I've tried is either the rainforest, it has a strong taste of ginger and I'm not a fan of ginger. The other ones are pretty good too. However, I didn't realize that these cookies were so small, but I guess based on the big portions of today's society, this is a normal portion.<br /><br />Overall its good, would I buy again? Maybe if I was on a strict gluten-free diet.",4
"I bought this along with some arborio rice. The rice and the tahini were placed in a box and an airpack placed on top. So there was lots of room inside the box and the packing wasn't secure. During shipping, one of the jar tops of the tahini came off, soaking the box and its contents in tahini. I contacted customer service and they sent another shipment of tahini. It was apparently packed the same way and arrived in the same condition, leaking tahini. I did not open the box and refused to accept it and FedEx sent it back. I again contacted customer service, told them I was done with the exercise and they issued a credit. The tahini itself is acceptable but buying this from Amazon is not worth the effort.",2
"These are indeed some of the best chips I've ever had, but there's a caveat. One of the types of chip in the bag is much harder than the rest, sometimes almost painfully hard if your teeth or gums catch it just right. It's the light, semi-translucent chip, the yuca I think. Anyway, this would be a 5-star product without a doubt if that chip was removed or replaced. The others though are worlds above any name-brand chips or potato chips out there. Another good thing is what it lacks; no artificial preservatives, no cholesterol, very little sodium and very little carbohydrates. They are certainly a welcome break from all the garbage sitting on store shelves, in taste and in health.",4
"It would have been nice if aspartame had been listed in the product description.<br />Instead I am stuck with a box of cider that no one in my house can drink.<br /><br />Aspartame causes migraines in my family, as well as just not being a healthy alternative.<br /><br />Funny, now I see that the aspartame is listed in product description.  I wish it had been there when I ordered.",1
"I just received a shipment of this tea (6/24/10) and notice that on the Amazon info lists the third ingredient as ""Artificial flavor"", but the listing on the box says ""Natural flavor"" and specifically states there is no artificial flavor in it.  So, don't be put off by the Amazon listing or reviews that used that as a source for their review.",4
"When I need a snack I know fruit would be better for me, but chips are easier to eat. Then I discovered how easy this is to eat and how much better for me.",4
"When I first opened the bottle it smelled medicinal. I added it to some iced tea and it tasted just like it smelled, very medicinal and only a trace of fruit flaver. I ordered 2 other flavors and they're the same. I gave it an extra star because service is good, but I can't recommend the extract.",2
"I recently went on a gluten free diet.  Where this hurts the most so far is breakfast.  There is barely any flavor to this cereal.<br /><br />I picked up mine from Whole Foods, not Amazon.<br /><br />I'd rather it was fortified by vitamins and even though I'm sure it would taste worse, at least it would have taste and do me some good.  It really isn't filling.  The barely darkened milk doesn't taste chocolate, though does lose some of the good taste of the only thing with taste - the milk.  I don't know if it is the rice flavor, or the general lack of flavor, but there is a hint of staleness, I think.  Could I add sugar?  Sure, and then I'd taste the sugar or sugar substitute, but that doesn't make it more healthy.<br /><br />To be fair, it isn't bitter, or too salty, or too sweet, or sour, so there isn't anything there to offend.  If you are eating it fast enough, it won't be mush.  If it has stopped making noise, you are in danger of mushiness.  It makes some truly good snap crackle and pop noises.  I suppose the cereal is bad enough to encourage you to eat some fresh fruit to have a good taste in your mouth and remember to take a daily vitamin (I can only take those every other day).<br /><br />It is cheaper than granola.  When I can afford it, I'm totally getting outrageous gluten free granola.  I also have envirokids to try next.",2
"Taste just like the real thing. The course grind is perfect for out auto drip maker. It's almost not fair. With a little cream, it makes me think I'm drinking a real double double.",4
"These cookies are small, grainy and very crunchy with an awful aftertaste. And very expensive for such a small package of 16 cookies. Might be great for multiple allergies, But I was very disappointed.",2
"Was very excited to try these out, but we are very disappointed with what we received. We ordered 2 lbs of these seeds and can hardly eat them due to the salt content. They really are crusted in a heavy layer of salt...it almost hurts your mouth. They are a great size and texture, but the flavor is just way too overwhelming. I wonder if these people even taste their product before they ship them out!",1
"I started using Cytomax back around 2001, and it was the most amazing sports drink I had ever had. Taste, performance, ease of use; it had it all. I read the reviews here discussing a formula change, and went ahead and gave it a shot. I'm halfway through my newest container, and it's just not working. The taste is subtly off, and viscosity/texture of it is subtly off as well. Finally, and I have no way of explaining this at all, I think it actually gives me a light headache when I'm drinking it. Performance-wise, I think it generally still works, in that it provides some calories and hydration for longer workouts. But I don't like drinking it. All said, I will never buy it again. I will test out <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054S4HMK"">Accelerade Lemon Lime 60 servings</a> and hammer products, etc, and see which one is the best, and go with that. New formula fails.",1
"This tea was very smooth and comforting. I usually don't go for anything licorice flavored, but found that this tea is a nice combo of chai flavors with some anise undertones. I think it would be more than tolerable to someone who hates black licorice like I do! I'm not sure if it actually detoxes, but after drinking it (with food) for about 3 days I started getting rid of water weight and felt more alert without being caffenated which is definitely a plus. I had a little more energy and my mood calmed a bit. I think it needs to be consumed for a longer period of time maybe 2 weeks or more in order to really feel results, but that's the basic principle when it comes to detoxing with any tea or diet foods. I only had 3 bags of it so obviously it would have benefitted me had I a few boxes of this stuff. Good tea!",4
"I purchased this as the winter months are upon us. However who invented the container that the soup is packaged in needs to go back to the drawing table.As the product is heating in the microwave,They tip over spilling the contents. So not only have you lost your meal but a big mess to clean up too. I have a case to use up so will just empty into a mug to heat.",2
"There is no way I would have known beforehand exactly how Greek coffee tasted.  I went on the recommendation of an article citing it's medicinal qualities. I'm sorry but this was the worst tasting coffee I've EVER had! The seller was quick and had a good price but again, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COFFEE!",1
"I did - I really wanted to like them, but was unable to get there. The first I had was untoasted, with lox and cream cheese. It was inedible. The second try was toasted, with lox and cream cheese - thus configured, it was edible, but not in any way enjoyable. I'd rather put the stuff on low carb scandinavian crisp bread. My wife reports a similar experience but she's not quite as negative as I. Even she can't take more than 1/2 a bagel at a time. So we've sliced them in half and frozen them, and plan to take them out 1/2 a bagel at a time for her to put strong flavored cheese on (such as an extra sharp cheddar or gouda) when she wants. She reports that with a strong enough flavored cheese, they are edible enough. That's not a sterling endorsement but if you want to try them 1. toast them 2. Put something strong enough to overcome the sawdust-like aftertaste 3. Repeat step 2.",2
"This was a cute little meal and I was excited to try it.  I personally didn't like the taste of the salmon.  It just wasn't to my liking.  The other items in the pack were good, but way too many soy beans.  I didn't think the taste was bad, but it wasn't pleasing.  I would probably buy this product if the salmon was a plain or a smoked flavor though.",3
"This is worth putting on subscription. Works every time in regular bread machine. No need for fancy new machine w special cycles. Just follow directions and use rapid setting, medium crust, large loaf. I've tried 4 machines and every loaf worked. Even family memebrs who don't need to avoid gluten eat this.",5
"This tea just isn't for me--I thought it was a little gross. It didn't seem to taste like chocolate OR hazelnuts.I don't really think it had much taste at all, really.  Pretty disappointing. I didn't add any sugar to it, so perhaps the flavor would change a little with some sweetness?",2
"My kids, and myself did not like this product, and ended up with a case!  It is like a fig cookie, which we don't like either.  Therefore, if you like fig cookies then this one would be great.",1
"The taste is bitter, the smell is atrocious, and they are not naturally smoked.  ""Aqueous natural smoke"" is a chemical stew injected into the fish.  For anyone thinking these are the real thing, all I can say is 'there is a sucker born every minute.'",1
Very salty. Can't taste cinnamon or sugar. don't waste your money. Better off buying pork rinds at the store.Very disappointed.,1
"I bought this on the hope of great taste. If you melt it and dip your finger into the oil, it has no taste at all. It does not taste bad, just no taste. Now what do I do with three tubs of the stuff. I am going to mix it with real butter to see if I can get something out of it. Butter salt or real butter is better than this.",1
"This jerky is okay at best unless you're salt fanatic.  I'm a heavy salter, but this stuff is over the top...",3

"I'm a man. As a man, I lead people to believe that I don't mind pain. A few exfoliating micro-globules? Bring 'em on!<br /><br />Yet, in reality, it's all a ruse. I don't like pain!

In contrast, this Dove Men body wash is less like morning dew, and more like shrapnel from an IED.<br /><br />Look, I know we Men CLAIM to be manly and strong. But we don't much like bathing with shrapnel. Exfoliating beads? We'll leave that to you ladies.<br /><br />GRADE: 1.5 MAN POINTS",2
"I ordered a single box of this tea and received it today.  The aroma of the tea is fantastic.  It is very similar to pumpkin pie which reminds me of Thanksgiving and Autumn in general.  However the flavor of the tea is too weak.  I can barely taste the spices or any pumpkin flavoring.  Note:  I drink all my tea without cream, milk or sweetners.<br /><br />I will finish the box I ordered, but I doubt I will order any more.",2
"I gave one to each of my dogs.  The little one, under 10 lbs, took a sniff and dropped it.  The thing was almost as big as her so it isnt for small dogs.  My medium dog couldnt get his mouth around it either and he is about 20 lbs.  On the flip side, my 50 lb dog tore the thing apart like there was no tomorrow.  He thought it was the coolest thing ever and chewed it to pieces.  In his opinion it was the coolest thing since sliced alpo.  Now, we must remember that these things would probably not be good for dogs under about 30 lbs.  I have a junkyard dog so I dont worry about his digestion because it is made of iron.  He did manage to plow through the treat in about 20 minutes.  As to the smaller dogs, they are out of luck I guess.  Anyway, it is a good item from the dogs sense.  They did all like the smell, and they did try to chew it up.  The little ones just were to lazy to try to get to the middle.  I will see if they eat more later.",4
Miss Vickies are better but unfortunately less widely available.  I'm not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and Miss Vickie's are better IMHO.,3
"If you're familiar with Special K bars, this one will come as no shock--the texture, the taste, etc. are exactly what you'd expect. Which, in some odd, backhanded way, makes the comfort food, I guess. There's no mold-breaking going on here, which will keep existing fans happy, but probably won't win Special K any new fans. Not that this is a bad thing in any way. ***",3
I highly recommend these from Omaha Steaks. They taste fantastic and no grease like most other burgers you can make yourself.,5
My mother recommended that I try Royal Jelly. Not this brand but to try the product in general. Supposedly it works wonders fo arthritis pain and other ailments. And I know other people have felt the effects of this product but i haven't. I will say the taste isn't bad and it looks like regular honey but other than satisfying your sweet tooth i don't see the benefit of this product.,2
"Long time online shopper, but first time ever writing a review. We have a 7 month old Great Dane pup. When we got her at 12 weeks, the breeder had her eating Holistic Select Giant breed puppy food, which was good for awhile. Then her stool became very loose. So upon reading other reviews we switched to Eagle Pack Giant breed puppy food. Her stool was still a little loose, but we thought that it was possibly the switch of the foods so we wanted to give it a chance. Well after about 5-30lb. bags of eagle pack, her stool was still very loose and she was eating her and our other dogs poop. (very gross to be kissed by that....YUCK) A friend told us that she was doing that because she was missing a vitamin or supplement in her diet. She was also consuming a tremendous amount of food as well as always voraciously hungry. We started researching what to do then all of the sudden she was having uncontrollable diarrhea, not good for a 100lb. puppy. We did not have time for anymore research we had to do something now!<br /><br />We ended up at a local store and discovered Chicken Soup for the Puppy Lover's Soul Large Breed Puppy Dry Dog Food. We decided to try a a 18lb bag, even though the protein levels were a couple percentage points higher than we had been told to give a Great Dane. But the list of ingredients was wonderful when compared with a lot of other top brands, I am no expert but just reading the long list of ingredients it seemed that they had more all natural ingredients, as opposed to the supplements that the others were putting in their food.<br /><br />We got it home and immediately made a complete switch from the Eagle Pack food she was on. We did not do the customary blending of foods for a week or so to introduce the new food and ween her off the old. We did not have time as her tummy was so upset, we also did not want anymore of the Eagle Pack in her system. She loved the taste and gobbled it up. Within about 24 hours her poops started to firm up a bit. This got progressively better as the week went by, but still a little soft as to make picking up difficult especially on grass. We added In Clover Fresh Digest Daily Intestinal Aid for Dogs to her food and presto she pretty much has a firm stool every time, She is also eating noticeably less food (YAY!$$$) which she seams to be getting better nourishment from it. She is also no longer eating poop (YAY!!!). We attribute that the little bit extra protein in this food is what she was missing from her diet. We are going to ween her off the In Clover Fresh Digest Daily Intestinal Aid for Dogs and see how she does without the supplement now that she is totally use to her new food.<br /><br />To sum it up:<br />1. Good quality ingredients<br />2. Less supplements than some other brands<br />3. Slightly higher protein than we would like, but it keeps her from eating poop so that is ok<br />4. Affordable<br />5. Retains more of the food so she eats less, which saves a fair amount of money.<br />6. Her coat is super shiny and healthy<br /><br />P.S. We also switched our senior citizen American Bulldog to the Eagle Pack Adult food, and she got a very loose stool as well, and she has never been loose a day in her life. We now have her on Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Large Breed Dry Dog Food, and she is great and very healthy as well.",1
wow def would love to buy in cases of 24 but the price is def way too much these are 99 cents each and he's trying to sell it for double what a rip off the should be for 23 bucks or 24. when you lower the price to that u will have a buyer.,1

"Very cute. Mine is a little tilted, he leans to one side--the legs weren't assembled straight, but it's still functional. The only thing I don't like is that the dispenser gives about 15 m&ms at once and you have to make sure to catch them when you use the lever in the back--they just fly out because it's such a large opening. The good thing is that I should be able to refill with peanut m&ms (they came with regular).",3
"After a friend of mine let me try his &quot;Dave's Insanity Sauce&quot;, and I loved the heat kick. Since Dave's can only be purchased on-line, I had a limited choice from my grocery store. I was suprised to see Ass Kickin' Cajun Hot Sauce on the shelf, and from looking at the name I guessed it would be hot. Well, after trying it on a burrito, I can say it is not that hot. And the bottle only lets you put a drop on at a time. I spent more time trying to get hot sauce out than eating. And since it was not as hot as I wanted, I kept putting more and more on tyring to get some heat which lead to another problem- the taste of vinigar was too strong. Too bad, I was looking forward for something really hot. I guess I will have to wait for my internet order to come it. For those of you who eat tobasco, this is better than tobasco and has a little more heat. For those of you who want very hot, look elsewhere.",2
"I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though.",3
Im so happy amazon sells this item it is hard to find in my area my whole family loves the french vanilla flavor gives it a better taste!  Highly recommend!!,5
"I conducted a blind taste test between 4 different waters:  tap water, tap water filtered through a Brita filter, a popular bottled water, and this product.  All of the waters were at room temperature. Not surprisingly, the tap water tasted the worst.  The bottled water was next, and I would say that this water tied with the Brita filter water for good taste.  The Essentia water tasted ""softer"" (similar to Evian), but with a better flavor. It has a little after-taste which I presume is related to the minerals.  I can't evaluate any health benefits because I've only tried the product for a few days, but I'll update this review if I notice anything.  Bottom line-- at home I'll still probably use Brita-filtered water because it's less expensive, but when buying water at the store or needing bottled water for any reason, this is an excellent choice and better-tasting than typical bottled water.",4
"I have tasted the kopi luwak coffee. Yes, it is processed through an animal's intestinal tract, but pleasantly, I can assert all fecatorial concerns are diminished once the beans are presented to the company by the blessed animal.<br /><br />I have had this in espresso, cappuccino and regular brew form. It tastes like a very decent cup of coffee, but nothing so remarkable that it requires its excessive cost.<br /><br />It is expensive at any price above the market value of a standard Sumatran bean, as the value is not in the taste (ordinary), but its exoticness.<br /><br />Civets eat the coffee berries and then pass the beans. In doing so, various chemicals are extracted that normally are part of coffee we are familiar with. Is it is enough to lift the quality to one worth the investment? No.<br /><br />If the idea is intriguing, and you want to say you have tasted all life offers, consider the kopi luwak bean. You will have a very good cup of coffee and a great laugh. If you are looking for a terrific flavor beyond all others, look at other beans.<br /><br />Pass on this and enjoy more of something else.<br /><br />--Brockeim",2
A treat for my dogs that is actually good for them. Also at much better price than I had found previously at my local retailers....Great product at a huge savings - what could be better!,5
"We think the Kiwi-Berry flavor is not overly sweet like the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E"">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> although it is still just a hair sweeter than we would have liked.<br /><br />However, when compared to traditional sodas and colas, this is a healthier and tastier alternative, as this is made of various juice concentrates and carbonated water, without sugar and corn syrup.<br /><br />Having said that though, this 8.3oz can packs 135 calories, most of them coming from the fruit sugars of course. Another plus is that one serving (the whole can) has 100% RDA of Vitamin C.<br /><br />We also give them bonus points for encouraging recycling of this can and putting that notice in a rather visible spot using the same font as the rest of their text - instead of fine-printing it.",4
"The Breadshop's 'Crunchy Oat Bran' granola tastes OK. I've had much better tasting granolas for less money. But my biggest disappointment is with the texture. I like granola with crunchy clusters and this cereal lacks that. The cereal consists of small bits that are relatively uniform in size and it impresses me as a 'whole' food that has been over-processed. I'd give it three stars for taste, two stars for value, and one star for texture, which averages two stars.",2
"Fifteen pounds of dog food -- and a Yorkie who suggests I keep it in the bag where it obviously belongs.  In her defense, I should add that this is a dog who has been raised on dry dog food (and the occasional bit of cat chow and hamburger when she can snag a morsel), so her opinion is not based on the difference between kibble and canned food.<br /><br />Looking at the ingredients, I am not surprised at her lack of enthusiasm.  The first ingredient is yellow corn meal, with corn gluten meal coming in at third place.  Chicken byproduct meal is also in the top ingredients.  And I'm still looking for real meat -- the kind that dogs go for.  Certainly, this product has lots of vitamins and minerals, plus fish oil, so there are ingredients to be pleased about, but, on the whole, those vitamins and minerals won't do much good if the dog goes on a hunger strike.  So it's back to the expensive stuff for this Yorkie.  Glad she doesn't eat like a Great Dane!",3
"I was so excited to use this when my daughter started on vegetables. When I went to blend the food, the darn blade was broken! Needless to say I was not happy and had to return it for a refund. Rather than buying another one and trying again, I'm going with another product altogether. Very disappointing but glad Amazon gave me a full refund!",1
"I am a chocolate fanatic and pairing chocolate with tea only seems natural to me.  I've sampled several chocolate flavors and this Stash tea, when compared to the others, is nothing spectacular.  When unbrewed, the Stash tea bag smells like chocolate but that scent does not translate to much of a chocolate flavor once the tea is brewed.  I could taste quite a bit of vanilla and some nut but the chocolate was just negligible. Additionally, there was a strange aftertaste with this tea.  It just wasn't pleasant.<br /><br />If you are committed to a chocolate decaffeinated beverage, your choices will be limited. I have sampled quite a few chocolate teas and many use a black tea base.  However, if interested in a caffeine free tee that has a good body, I would recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I"">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a>, which is a naturally caffeine free tea.  Zhena's chocolate chai is supposed to taste like chocolate, but it has a lot of spices.  Still, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I"">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a> has a much richer overall flavor than the Stash Premium Chocolate Hazelnut tea.<br /><br />If you don't care about caffeine and are just looking for a chocolate tea, there are several others that I would recommend before this one.  They include: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031TJ0X0"">Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO64F6"">SerendipiTea ChocolaTea, Chocolate, Vanilla, Rooibos & Black Tea, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QY03TC"">Bigelow White Chocolate ObsessionTea, 1.6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  The first two are loose teas and the last is a bagged tea.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I don't think I would recommend this Stash tea to any chocolate lover.  It doesn't taste like chocolate and the overall flavor is poor.",2
"I ordered Caribou Blend and they sent me a box of 80 Daybreak Blends, which was nasty tasting and a medium blend. I could not return it because it was not unopened in its original packaging (I had tried a few cups, thinking I would like it if I kept drinking it). I'm halfway through the box, too cheap to dump it, but ordering more because I can't take it anymore! Watch out, I'm not the only one who's had this happen to them.",2

It seems like a lot of the kinds they couldn't sell. This seems like it would great if you didn't drink cofee but wanted a mix for your office or to have for your fiends who drink coffee. 9 were not coffee- I knew there would be a few but 9? 5 of them were decafe.  There were only 5 flavors that were light (like mudslide). I guess I didn't look close enough at the description.  I wanted a yummy coffee mix- this was not it.  I would never buy this again!,2

"Ok cats, you can stop wiggling and showing me your lovely bellies, and get up and play.<br /><br />Let's get down to the nitty gritty. Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food does what it says it does and MORE!!!<br /><br />Now, I DO feed my cats wet food, so I give them Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food as a TREAT and a SUPPLEMENT -- and it is powerful stuff!! To be graphic, let's just say that Big Bad Baby Twinkle's poops used to look like small rocks, no matter what I did for her food (and she loves her daily hairball gel too) -- but NOW after feeding her even a small amount of Hill's Science Diet Adult Hairball Control Dry Cat Food (twice a day after she eats her wet food) one look at her litterbox and I think that a German Shepherd has visited the litterbox. To say that this makes me happy may sound wierd but now I KNOW that ""stuff"" is moving THROUGH her intestines and not getting impacted or staying inside and creating toxins.<br /><br />The same for Cee Cee kitty -- she, who is daaainty and small (BBBT weighs twice as much as Cee Cee and is twice as long as Cee Cee), also pops out some big ones now. I am happy -- yes I am -- this means their intestinal transit time (from eating to pooping) is shorter and they are healthier for it.",5
"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1

"This is a great product. Coconut has been vilified by some in previous years for being a saturated fat, and therefore unhealthy, but more recent evidence suggests that although it is a saturated fat, it is a different type of saturated fat than the saturated fats in animal products, and in fact is especially healthy. The more recent evidence suggests that coconut, especially coconut oil, helps with weight loss and is heart healthy.<br /><br />All I know is that it fits in well with a lower carbohydrate diet, has plenty of fiber, and can be used in many recipes.<br /><br />In fact, I'm about to have my hot brekafast cereal containing almond meal and coconut.",5
"This product tastes very good. The almond and coconut pairs well together. I can't find anything wrong with this product. It's not like the typical tasting fruit and nut bar, or a granola bar. Rather, it's in a field on its own. I appreciate how healthy it is for you (low calorie, low sugar, low sodium, gluten free, etc...) but you wouldn't know it by the flavor. I am certain you will like the taste of it.",5
"Wanted to try a new tea, so selected Cinnamon Vanilla.  It is good, though will have to get used to the flavor.",4
"One thing you'll notice from having this tea, right off the bat is the larger size of the tea leaves, and how much tea is in the bag itself. I went back to the market and have since bought 3 more boxes of tea from different brands, and quality and size are easily noticeable; Stash PGT's leaves actually look like leaves, and not burnt up, shriveled sawdust. They leaves also have a pretty color, and aren't oxidized.<br /><br />Since I grew up on sugar laden drinks, drinking both teas without sugar was rough, but now that I'm used to it, these teas are just super tasty and don't even need a grain of sugar. I also cold brew my tea, rather than pour warm/scalding/hot water on it. I was reading on a forum that brewing teas in cold water helps to draw out more antioxidants. Cold brewed black tea is better for you than hot brewed oolong, believe it or not. Also, I can't stomach the flavor of warm/scalding/hot water tea. It's just...bleh. Cold-brewing tea is similar to making sun tea, except, it isn't placed in the sun. I ""brew"" my tea from anywhere between 15 min to 30 min.<br /><br />~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br /><br />Stash is a great starter tea if you've never seriously drunk tea before. After tasting around a bit, this tea is not really as good as I thought it was...Taste around, it's the only way you'll know if somethings really good or not~",3
I didn't realize it but my tea wasn't arriving as promptly as suggested. The company also noticed and sent a box out immediately! WOW! I was very impressed!,5
"1.  Box arrived with case wrapped in a plastic bag, containing one can (empty), and a soggy cardboard tray with the other 23 cans. It appears to have blown up either prior to, or at UPS, as the box was a UPS box.<br /><br />2.  Positive- the level of carbonation was very good.<br /><br />3.  The flavors reminded me of rancid cough syrup. NONE of the 12 flavors were worth more than a sip, or the second can. There was a full-on flavor malfunction and also an aftertaste that did not want to go away.  The Dr. Zevia certainly was named well, for the resemblance to medicine.  The root beer smelled like root beer.  The fruit flavors weren't artificially colored, so essentially all looked like lemon-lime (which is actually fine by me).<br /><br />I'm just glad I got the sampler case, and wasn't left with 23  full cans and one with a single sip taken out of it.  The first two cans, I'd poured over ice, and took a good slug, and nearly choked.  After that, it was a tentative sip of the remaining 10 flavors.  I couldn't find ONE that I'd ever want to have again.<br /><br />I REALLY wanted to like this stuff. I'm a diabetic, so diet soda isn't just a preference- it's what I have to have if I'm going to drink soda at all. I budgeted for 2 cases from my next pay check (guess I'll be getting more cases of WATER).  I generally like erythritol and stevia sweetened items- especially erythritol- I use it on cereal.  Tastes just like sugar, and can be used for baking as well as cold items.<br /><br />Total waste of more than $25.  That could have bought my perishable items this week.",1
"I ordered a case of these a few weeks ago and while they are made with cracker material they are not crackers they are a cross between bread crumbs and crutons.  Not one cracker, in any of the boxes, are within ten percent of whole.  They are all pulverized!  There was no damage on the outer case, or any of the inners, but they look like they were either dropped from the 78th floor or tossed into the truck at 100 MPH.  It's total loss.  I would not chance it again.",1
"First I want to say I love most all Hershey's candy bars. That's why I was so surprised when I made my famous home made chocolate chip cookies with this brand (instead of what I normally use, Nestl&eacute;) and they tasted so bad I had to throw out the entire batch. Nothing more to say, they were that bad and I was hugely dissapointed.<br /><br />For full disclosure I did not buy these at Amazon so to prove I did buy and try them I include a photo above. You'll see I also tried the milk chocolate chips. They were horrible too.",1
"Don't be fooled by the slick graphic of a young green coconut with coconut water splashing out of it.  Also, don't let the ""USDA Organic"" stamp sway your purchase.  Not only is this coconut water from ""concentrate"", it also has ""natural flavors"" which is liberally used by companies who don't want you to know their products contain MSG.  For further information about this go to the excellent website Truth in Labeling where I had a re-education on reading labels.  MSG is a neurotoxin and it is something you don't want to be ingesting.",1
"These are not the same Clorets gum you may remember.  I tried several packs of the gum and they were all off.  No wonder you can't find these in stores anymore, they are of a very poor quality.  Again, do not buy these if you're looking for Clorets.",1
"Dark chocolate, cool mint make this an excellent candy bar. The filling is smooth, not chalky with a thin chocolate coating.  I keep mine in the freezer to save, then i grab a couple for the road.",5
"I love this full flavored tea any time, but you really need to like hibiscus to enjoy it. It can taste a bit sharp sometimes if you over-steep it.",4
"i had the other ones from starbucks, but wanted to try something different especially with the combination of macadamia and mango, but this didn't seem to mesh well. probably wont buy these again.",3
"I love the rich, full-bodied flavor of a dark-roast coffee.  When I bought my first Keurig machine I wasted no time in ordering all of the dark roast K-cups that I could find.  I initially settled on Newman's Own Dark Roast as my ""go-to"" coffee, but I didn't stop there.  I like to keep experimenting and looking for something new.  I happened to find Coffee People's Organic Extra Bold blend and was blown away.  It has been my favorite ever since I first tried it.  Last week I saw a listing for a Colombian dark roast sold under the Wolfgang Puck name (it is processed and distributed by Van Houtte) and decided to give it try.  Here is my impression of it:<br /><br />After brewing a cup (I used the 7 1/2 oz. setting) the first thing that I noticed was that it didn't have that freshly-brewed aroma that the Coffee People X-Bold does, however the taste was another story.  It hits your palate with medium acidity and a nice, sharp bite that gets your attention right away. The finish was surprising clean with a hint of spice (nutmeg or cinnamon?) and just a slight, lingering, pleasant bitterness.  I really like this coffee but I think that I will stick with Coffee People's Extra Bold and this will be my back-up brand.  However, I will keep looking for something new.  Who knows what I will find?<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7GYY"">Newman's Own&iquest; Organics Special Blend (Extra Bold), K-cups For Keurig Brewers, 24-count,  Boxes (Pack of 2)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L444OQ"">Coffee People Organic, Extra Bold K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]",4
"I didn't like this coffee at all.  I like strong, full-flavored coffee and this is not it.  There is mild bitterness and the coffee was slightly weak.  So far the only K-cup coffee that I enjoy is the Barista Prima Italian Roast (I think that's the brand), but I wanted something I could order on subscribe and save, so I always had coffee.<br /><br />I ordered the Tully's Italian Roast to see how it is, but it too isn't as good as the other.",1
"First, what I love about this flavor is that it's iced tea that is ready in under a minute. Whenever I want iced tea, it's there and doesn't require a lot of work. That being said, I wish it was a little more lemonade flavored than just lemon-ey. Sometimes if I let the drink sit a little too long it takes on pretty acidic lemon flavor that isn't all that pleasant. I also stumbled across a sample pack of the Southern Sweet Tea flavor since ordering this product and I've enjoyed it much more. This flavor is a good try by Celestial Seasonings but it still needs a little work.",3
"In my opinion, you have to have a taste for this kind of drink. My wife tasted it and really didn't care for it. It definitely wouldn't be my first pick for an energy drink. It reminds me of an energy drink that we had for our football team. So, I would say you can definitely develop a taste for it if your willing to take the time for it. I wouldn't say it gave me a boost but to some it might. I wouldn't waste money on it again. Save the money and buy some  kool-aid.",3
"Just like Top Ramen, but spicier.  Not too spicy, but not plain either.  I'd have this rather than Top Ramen, if I had to choose.",4
"This is one of those foods that again, you just need to sample a can before committing to an entire case. Thinking my male cheese junkie would love it, I grabbed a few cans for him.  Well, forget it!  Hates the stuff so badly that he will starve himself over eating it.  My female, however, goes gaga for all of these new cheese varieties.  Sorry, but tuna and cheese just sounds nasty to me but to her, well, get out of her way or she will mow you over on her way to the dish (if she doesn't slide there first!).  Anyway, great product, try to find it for less elsewhere because here in forgotten Ohio, this is a bit pricey.  Highly recommend!",5
"First, it's not coffee. It's an instant powdered mix, which is completely disappointing. I was expecting flavored coffee, not instant mix in a small container. Kind of defeats the purpose doesn't it?  I guess it's my fault for not having read the package? But no where in the product description does it indicate this is ""Instant Coffee"".<br /><br />I would never buy this product again.  It smells wonderful, but tastes like what it is, and that's simply not good for someone looking for a cup of coffee.",1
This is really hard to get to the right consistency for use as a spread. But for cooking! WOW! Thai peanut sauce with a fraction of the fat and calories! I don't really bake but I could see a lot of uses there. Tastes just like roasted peanuts. Will buy again.,5
"I'm on the fence with Grove Square's Cappuccino Cups - French Vanilla.<br /><br />On one hand, for the price at least, they're great. Sadly on the other hand, they're way too sweet for an every morning drink. The first time I tried it, I had already added cream and sugar before I ever took a sip. That was a bad idea.<br /><br />I'd buy it again in a lesser Qty, but 54 of these is going to last me a long time. They aren't bad at all, I just wasn't expecting such a sweet drink.",3
"I agree, I use this flour regularly. We quit buying any other they just don't measure up. But this price is awful. Walmart/Sam's beats it hands up.",3
"I thought this was great, my dog is afraid of it. It's made of hard plastic and my wimpy dog was afraid of it as soon as it turned over once against the floor. I've tried wrapping it with rubber bands to soften the roll but too little too late!<br /><br />Update... my dog's older brother loves it! He's a little bigger and is a total food whore so I thought he'd like it. He's just visiting but I'm sending it home with him and I think it's finally gonna get some great use!",3
"Check out the nutritional info, the SODIUM: 5,510 grams! 230% of your daily requirement. I used this and our casserole was ruined because it was so salty!!!!!! And what's up with that price? My box cost a dollar. Unfortunately I bought two boxes, so I'm throwing the other box away. No bargain here. It is wildly UN-delicious and UN-healthy for you!<br />(Yeah, I'm embarrassed that I didn't read the label first!)",1
"No need to review the product because I'm sure most people in the U.S. who are able to eat peanuts have had these.  These arrived fresh and in good condition.  I can't give even peanut M&Ms more than 4 stars since I think the chocolate used in these products keeps getting worse and worse over time; but they are still a fun, enjoyable snack.<br /><br />I ordered this along with a box of Snickers with Almonds, and Amazon included, as part of my Prime membership, a free ""cold pack"".<br /><br />This consisted of a very thick and sturdy Styrofoam lidded box, in which the candies were packed, along with four large cold-pack freezable units.<br /><br />The item was in shipping transit for approximately 3 days, and delivered to a hot, humid region.<br /><br />Upon opening the container, I found that the candies were still cold and in good condition, although the cold-packs were no longer frozen or really cold.<br /><br />Amazon did a great job on packing this.  Thought I would share that, in case others are concerned about ordering such products from this company.  I'm even keeping the Styrofoam chest and cold-packs for re-use, since they are of pretty nice quality.",4
"Clusters? I didn't get any clusters. A couple of residual clumps, but thanks to insufficient packaging, all I got was essentially a bag of powder.<br /><br />I'd attribute part of that to Amazon choosing to send me the single bag in nothing more substantial than a bubble mailer, but the factory packaging should be air-tight, and have enough air (well, nitrogen to keep it fresh) to survive a trip from Seattle to northwest Oregon. I could mail a bag of potato chips (of most major brands) and the chips ought to survive the trip intact.<br /><br />The powder tastes okay. But crushed that much, I can't really consider this a snack anymore. I am very disappointed.<br /><br />Maybe I'll try some from the grocery store where I can make sure it's not already crushed, and then transport it myself in a suitable fashion, but even if it turns out to be good, I can't recommend buying it from Amazon unless they find a better way to ship it than a bubble mailer. I can't believe anyone could have thought that was a good idea!",1
"These pods make a liquid that tastes like coffee-flavored water. Marley recommends using 8 ounces of water per pod - I like my coffee strong, so I used just 6 ounces. It didn't help.<br /><br />I compared them to Senseo medium roast pods. The Senseo pods make a cup of coffee that is stronger but doesn't taste as good. I think the pod system doesn't lend itself to great coffee.<br /><br />I plan to take these pods with me when I travel, and use them in place of the pods the hotel provides. As long as I'm having bad coffee, it might as well be organic and fair trade and all. So they are somewhat useful to me, hence three stars.<br /><br />Coffee maker: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GW873G"">Hamilton Beach Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer</a><br /><br />Update: I stayed in a hotel with a small, cone-type coffee maker (not a Pod system). I put two Marley pods in the maker and made about 12 ounces of coffee, which I ran through the maker a second time (the first time it was very watery looking). The resulting coffee was about three stars good - not very strong, but a fair cup of coffee.",3
"This coffee isn't bad but it's nowhere near as good as the Gavalia Morning Roast.  It has a decent flavor and is fine if you don't like a strong coffee.  If I couldn't get the Gavalia Morning Roast, I would buy this coffee again but it would not be my first choice.",3
"This Oregano is fantastic. The aroma makes your mouth water. The flavor is not overpowering as some other brands are.<br /><br />Others, with whom I've shared this with, really love it too. This is the best Oregano.<br /><br />Try it; it will be the one you come back to time after time.  Great product Starwest Botanicals!",5
"i bought this two-pack as well as the significantly cheaper (per gram) <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CMA1YG"">Nando's Extra Hot Peri Peri Sauce, 4.7-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a>.  i wanted to compare how this ""Traditional"" extra hot style compares to the regular one.  instead, the two-pack i received contained two of the same bottles as were in the six-pack.<br /><br />don't get me wrong--this sauce is amazing!  it's tangy, slightly hot, and generally just delicious.  i do wish it was actually ""extra hot"" as its name claims, but it's easy enough to add some ghost pepper sauce or fresh ground chili to get the full effect.<br /><br />but the whole reason i bothered with this two-pack is because it was labeled as ""Traditional"" in the product image and i wanted to compare it to the other kind.  since it turns out to be exactly the same, this was a waste of money.",3

"I have had this on order for about a total of 8 bags. I first had a good experience and what seemed like a quality jerky and continued to keep it ordered on my subscribe and save account. The next 2 bags were awful. There were tiny bits and they were extra hard and grisly. I thought maybe it was just a bad run and let the next order come through. They were terrible also. It was like there was one or two decent strips of meat, and the rest was inedible. I'm not sure how this keeps happening. I had meant to cancel this subscription but remembered after I was shipped another pack of two. Maybe they'll be better but I haven't been eager to to open them. Roll of the dice, I guess.",2

"These are just mixed beans in a bag.  I made them two times to far and both times it was very good, however I'm not sure I'd call it soup.  It's more like a thick stew.  I'm new to making beans but i'm a decent cook and know how to follow directions.  Thick Bean Stew.",4
I agree the product is fine but today I poured a brand new 2 quart jar into a plastic rubbermaid pour container only to realize that I had been shorted by 4 oz!  The jar is only 28 ounces not 32 as it is meant to be.  Maybe someone else knows what to do with this info.,1
"Purchased this on the advice of Dr. Mark Hyman, the well known author. I take a tablespoon or two with a glass of water right after breakfast and again after dinner and it keeps things moving, especially when eating a diet that's high in protein and low in fiber. Any other health benefits that come with it are bonuses as far as I'm concerned.",5
"These bars had very good reviews so I tried them. I don't like the fact that they taste like viamins.The bars expire soon also, as though they were close to expiration when I ordered them. Very disappointed.",2
The container for this is very sloppy.  I would not mess with buying this product.  The formula is overpriced.  Check out Walmart's brand formula Parents Choice.  This formula is similar to Similac Advance.  My pediatrician recommended this brand and my friends use it also.  Seriously I wouldn't spend your hard earned money on a formula that is seriously overpriced.,1
"I bought this for my mom as a gift because she LOVES this flavor and has trouble finding it except during the holidays.  It is packaged in just a plain, cardboard box but I guess that's because this quantity is usually bought by restaurants.  Still, it is the same Christmas Eve tea that you can purchase from the Stash website and I bought the 100-ct for only a couple of dollars more.",4
"Honestly, I have to admit that I expected a little better. That's not to say that this is bad coffee - in fact it's quite bold without being too acidic, and pretty satisfying overall. I think my main problem is that Wolfgang Puck's name is attached to it, so perhaps it set my expectations a little high. I have a Wolfgang Puck knife set that I adore, and is very high quality for what I paid for it. This coffee was on sale, so it was well worth it also, I just hoped for something that would knock my socks off - which it didn't. I also purchased the Breakfast blend, and Jamaica me crazy at the same time. The breakfast blend was the best, in my opinion, and the jamaican coffee smelled the best, but was the least successful.",4
The presence of few bitter hazelnuts eclipses the good nutty flavor of the majority. Wish there was a way to 'sniff' out the bitter and rancid ones. Will not buy again.,2
"My family loves gold fish, we eat them all of the time. Put them in soup, snack on them at lunch and late at night. I bought the whole grain version to have something a bit healthier... although they aren't healthy by any means! The box is a great size, it's a bit smaller then the ones you might see at a grocery store though so do not expect one of the humongous boxes but it is still a great size and lasted my family of 3 for about a month which is a lot more affordable than buying the smaller boxes every week!",4
Fine coffee.  I alternate between Larry's organic single source beans and this coffee.  This coffee generates more crema--probably due to the inclusion of robusta beans.  Nice mild-ish flavor without sour notes in my PID-controlled Silvia.,4
"I bought a 6 pack box since it looks exactly like the one my wife was buying at Whole Foods. but just slightly less expensive. Unfortunately it was the only similarity with the one from Whole Foods. It tastes differently and not as intensive, but the most important is that it doesnot help with the lactation, so after using one pack, we had to come back to Whole Foods and now trying to return remaining 5 packs.",1
Tried this based on positive reviews. Very disappointed. Just slightly better(and more expensive) than grocery store coffee. Lavazza should be sued for false advertising for putting the word gusto on the package! I will go sprinting back to my BOLD Starbucks and happily pay the modest difference!,1
"One Love is a good, robust coffee - if you like a strong coffee in the morning, you should like the flavor. Honestly, I didn't really catch the hints of exotic floral and berry they advertise which is just as well as I enjoy a basic coffee. The single serving pods are handy but you can also use a couple in a regular machine and it works just fine as well. If you're environmentally concious, it is free trade certified and organic.  Partial proceeds are also donated to the charity kicksforcause.org.  Overall an enjoyable cup of coffee with decent flavor.",3
"I got a tin of this for Christmas years ago.  I haven't tried this rub for it's intended purpose, but I add a couple tablespoons to each 5lb batch of sauerkraut I make and it makes the magic happen.  I get rave reviews when I take it to cookouts.",5
"This tea was not terrible, but lacked the distinctive malt flavor I associate with Scottish Breakfast Tea. I rank it well below, for example, Twinings English Breakfast and Earl Gray tea.",2
"Before buying this, I thought I loved Indian food. I also used to think I liked spicy food. These mixes have made me second guess both of those beliefs.<br /><br />I've realized I like some indian food,but my sampling of Indian food has been limited to several indian restaurants and a few homemade dishes. Admittedly, this is not a very impressive resume. Usually when I order, I get the mildest dishes (saag paneer with lots of naan) in the mildest forms. I've ventured into the spicier curries and regretted it.<br /><br />So, on to this product. These mixes were much too spicy for me and weren't the type of indian food I enjoy. Looking at the other reviews it is obvious many people love these mixes, and plenty of those people are indian themselves. So, take my review for what it is worth. If you aren't sure if you like indian food, or only like select mild dishes at indian restaurants, these may not be for you. If you know you like authentic indian food and don't mind spiciness, disregard this review and read the other ones.<br /><br />I was going to give this 2 stars, because honestly the rest of these mixes are sitting on my shelf. However, I recognize that plenty of others with more experience in this category of food love these products, so 3 stars it is. Good luck, hope this helped!",3

"PROS:<br />Added sweetness without the added carbs<br />No effects on insulin levels<br />Safe for diabetics<br />Handy 1 g packages<br />0 calories<br />Organic<br /><br />CONS:<br />Sweet, but with a different overall taste than sugar<br />Bitter aftertaste is not completely eliminated<br />The bitter aftertaste is accentuated by the amount of product used--the more you add, the more you get the aftertaste<br />Fine grained, non-sugar like powder<br />Expensive<br /><br />OTHER NOTES:<br />Packaged for sweetening beverages, not for baking (not bulked up enough to be used on its own)<br />A single package is supposed to be equal to '2 tsp of sugar,' but this really depends on your own individual taste<br /><br />Trying to decrease the amount of empty carbs in my diet, I purchased Wholesome Organic Stevia from another vendor.  I have never really been a fan of stevia before, but I have used Wholesome Sweeteners' products before and after reading the written-on-the-box statement that they had developed the 'Best Tasting Stevia in the World,'  I decided to give stevia one more try.  I can't say that this product blew me away or has made me love stevia, but as stevia products go this one ain't bad.  It compares fairly with other stevia brands that I have used in the past. I found that it made a reasonable sweetener for coffee and tea, so long as I was careful not to use too much.  (Use too much and that well-known, bitter aftertaste really shoots through.)<br /><br />Stevia is an all natural sweetener that is promoted as a substitute for table sugar (sucrose).  There are any number of brands and different forms in which stevia is sold.  Popular formulations of stevia include highly concentrated liquid extracts and powdered forms, such as the stevia sold here.  Stevia is often mixed with other substances to bulk it up and to help hide stevia's well known bitter aftertaste.  In the case of the Wholesome Sweeteners product, the stevia is mixed with organic agave inulin and silica.<br /><br />In its natural form stevia leaves are something like 30 to 45 times the sweetness of table sugar, but the purified forms of stevia can be up to 250 to 300 times sweeter than sugar.  Commercial stevia is usually an extract from the Stevia rebaudiana plant, and, in this light, the Wholesome Sweeteners product is no exception.  The difference in commercial compounds is usually not the source of the stevia but rather the final purity/composition of the extract and how the stevia is extracted.  According to what I have read, the sweetness of the stevia is mostly derived from something called rebaudioside A, the major component 'steviol glycoside' that lends the sweetest taste to stevia with the least amount of bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />Companies may argue about the proper way to derive and purify their stevia extracts, but the major deciders,of course, are your own taste buds.  Let me just warn you:  do NOT attempt to taste test this (or any) stevia directly out of the package.  If you apply stevia directly to your tongue, you will be overwhelmed by the initial sweetness of the stevia and then majorly turned off by the awful, bitter aftertaste.  Stevia needs to be mixed into a larger volume (such as an 8 or 12 ounce cup of coffee) before it is sampled.<br /><br />When mixed into a cup of coffee, the Wholesome Sweeteners brand compared favorably to other brands of stevia that I have used.  The sweetness was certainly there, but is not exactly the same as table sugar.  For me, stevia has a more cotton-candy like sweetness that you may or my not prefer and for some odd reason it seemed more pronounced in the back rather than the front of my mouth (I don't have a good explanation for this, but for some reason it seems so).  I am okay with this kind of sweetness, but I prefer xylitol and erythritol(<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004X71550"">Swerve Sweetener, 16oz [1lb</a>]), which have a taste that is more similar to table sugar.  I didn't notice much of a bitter taste at first (1/2 packet in 8 ounces), but at higher concentrations (a whole packet in 8 ounces) the bitterness was definitely there.  Although it wasn't pronounced, it was disturbing enough to make drinking the coffee a less pleasant experience.  Xylitol and erythritol do exhibit a 'cooling effect' at higher concentrations that may disturb some people, but on the whole have a cleaner, more sucrose-like flavor--they taste more like sugar than the stevia does.<br /><br />On the whole, the taste was palatable at lower concentrations.  Since I'm not the kind of guy that likes to suck coffee directly through the sugar cube, this was okay for me.  But I will warn you that if you are someone who likes their coffee very sweet and you try this with stevia, you will definitely be disappointed by that bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />If you are into artificial sweeteners (we're talking taste here, not other issues), this stevia is definitely better than saccharine.  I've never really liked the taste of saccharine very much and saccharine has a much more pronounced bitter aftertaste.  In comparison to Splenda (sucralose), the stevia is probably a dead heat.  On taste alone, I'd describe Splenda's sweet taste as more similar to sugar, but I've always found the aftertaste of Splenda to be a big turn off.  At low concentrations, I'd prefer Wholesome Sweeteners' stevia, but at higher levels of sweetness, I'd prefer splenda.  Once again, on taste alone, I'd have to give a real edge to Equal (aspartame).  Equal's sweetness isn't completely sucrose-like, but it is closer to a more pure sweetness than stevia.  Equal also has a less pronounced aftertaste.<br /><br />That being said, the artificial sweeteners have their own baggage and plenty of folks avoid them.  In the natural realm of things, I prefer erythritol.  It is less sweet than sugar, but tastes more like sugar.  Erythritol also has fewer GI side effects and is lower in calories than xylitol (xylitol has 40% fewer calories than table sugar).<br /><br />Please note, that this stevia is not meant to replace sugar in baking.  Unless it is packaged with filler, it isn't bulky enough nor does it have enough sugar-like physical qualities to be a baking substitute. However, you can buy formulations of stevia that are bulked up with fillers or other sweeteners (inulin, erythritol, etc.) so that it can be used for baking.  As noted above, however, stevia has a distinct taste that may or may not work with your baked goods.<br /><br />On the whole, this isn't a bad way to go if you like the taste of stevia.  It is a reasonable choice if you like its unique, sweet taste.  For me, it tasted far better than the artificial sweeteners, saccharine and Splenda.  At lower concentrations, I found it to be a pleasant sweetener for coffee and tea and it's always nice to have another, natural sweetener to choose from.  However, I'm not ready to jump on the stevia bandwagon yet: I'll certainly finish off my box of stevia, but after that I'll be going back to my erythritol...",3
"I'm very picky when it comes to fruitcake.  I hate average fruitcakes that taste synthetic and are full of preservatives and who knows what else.<br /><br />But THIS fruitcake is amazingly good!  I ordered it out of curiosity and to try something new.  Wow!  So much flavor and richness!  It's moist without being soggy, and the cherries, pineapples, and nuts taste perfect with the brandy flavor and spices in the cake.  This is a very dark, rich, flavorful fruitcake.  It tastes homemade.<br /><br />I will definitely be ordering this again!  Probably soon, too, because I know this one won't last very long, it'll be eaten before Thanksgiving for sure!<br /><br />The seller was quick to ship and it was packaged great.",5
"I ordered the lemon lime flavor and although it works well to perk me up, it tastes the way lemon floor cleaner smells--hard to swallow without at least a shiver, even after ""getting used to it."" I like the orange flavor better. Much better!",3
"I enjoyed this coffee, but I'd say it's on the better side of decent.  I also sampled Melitta's Hazelnut Cafe Collection coffee recently and I preferred that variety.  There is a slightly odd, artificial taste in this coffee that I'm not thrilled with.<br /><br />To be clear, this is not bad coffee by any stretch.  It's fresh and seems to have a respectable caffeine content.  It is much, much better than a flavored coffee by Gevalia that I tried awhile back.  Certainly, you might like this a lot, as the vanilla taste, while not great, is not objectionable and the aroma is nice.<br /><br />I think that decent is a fair description and I'd give it a 3 star rating.  It's not a very expensive item, so if you're not sure, give it a try and decide for yourself.",3
"I was quite pleased with the Clear shampoo and conditioner, finding that they did not weigh down my hair.  My hair is thin, straight, prone to getting oily and I seem to be losing hair with age.  So I was fearful when I first opened the intense scalp nourishing balm and tried putting it on dry hair.  I first applied it to the hair, then noticed it was for the scalp so worked it in and brushed it through, then went to bed.  There was little sign of actual grease the next morning but my hair did have a sheen that looked a bit greasy.  It was presentable but not great.<br /><br />The second time I used it was after shampooing and conditioning with the Clear products.  In the shower I rubbed a small amount into my scalp, then blow-dried my hair.  I have to report that it looks great, no greasy look or feel. It is important not to overdo the amount used since it is thick.  The jar may last me for 6-8 months. It would have been better if they had actually told you how to use it- the product basically lacks instructions.<br /><br />If you have thick, frizzy or curly hair I think the product would be better for you than for me, although I am pleased with it now that I have figured out how to use the product.  The smell is quite mild and pleasant.  The price is good for something that will last a long time.",3
"The Sweet Potato and Duck Wrap has been specifically named in the latest FDA report as one of the dog treats that is unsafe to give your dog.  Please read the latest report yourself.  I also recommend a Facebook page ""Animal Parents Against Pet Treats and Food Made in China"" that list the facts on the brands that are considered to be unsafe. The CADET brand is named in the complaint. I have always bought my pet treats from the RAWHIDE DEPOT vendor on AMAZON, and have ordered the CADET brands...unaware that most CADET dog treats were sourced from China.  I will continue to order from RAWHIDE DEPOT.  I have gotten excellent service with them.  However, I will not order the CADET brand of dog treats again.",1
"It is an okay cereal. It has tiny grains after being cooked, which I am not fond of....I like more of an oatmeal consistency. It doesn't have much of a taste, especially in the way of being roasted.<br /><br />I will finish them off by mixing them with my steel cut oatmeal and not bother to buy them again.",3
"I was surprised when I received this product.  I was expecting the only size dubble bubble that I have seen packaged in a tube.  I was expecting the larger gumballs.  They seemed to be priced too high for the little gumballs.  The little gumballs I received had a 50 cent price tag.  If you sold the packages for that price, you would lose money.",2
"Upon receiving the KTC mustard oil, we noticed that the label said for external use only.  As the product was listed with other ""gourmet food items"" we had assumed that this was a mustard flavored food oil.  Not a mustard Seed oil.  There is a big difference and one that could be dangerous if not noted.  The Amazon ad did not relate any warnings or ingredient list that I could find, that would have helped me avoid purchasing the wrong item.",1
"For the price, this is a nice little gift. Nothing special and of mediocre quality at most.  The glass was coming out of mine when I received it but it wasn't broken.  And don't confuse the photo and the description of a ""box full of chocolates"" with what is actually in the box.  The chocolates are in two small packets that will easily fit in the palm of your hand. The box is mostly filled with straw but you can't tell that from the photo. It's appropriate that the chocolates are in individual packets but I did expect there to be a bit more of them.  The product description should include a better description of that but I expect most folks aren't buying this for the chocolate anyway. I haven't tried them since I'm giving this as a gift at an office Christmas party. I's sure someone will like this very much.",2
"I picked a 4-pack of Q Tonic up at the grocery store, not knowing it was supposed to be an ""artisanal"" product. Frankly, I just don't think it tastes very good; I think the main issue being that the taste of agave clashes with both the quinine and with the gin (and I tried it with two different kind of gins, Bulldog and Hendricks). It was also quite flat, which didn't help, though that could have just been a problem with the pack I bought. At any rate, it just doesn't make as good a gin and tonic as your standard variety tonic, despite costing a good deal more.",2
"I am in the process of trying all of the Annie Chun's Soup Noodle Bowls and Noodle Bowls. Of all the ones I bought I tried these first because these are the ones that I actually wanted to like the best. They were AWFUL !! Very overpowering lemony taste. I tried to eat them but could not even finish them. Now, you have to understand something, I am really not very picky as far as food is concerned. If I dont like something, I usually can pretty much finish it because I hate wasting food but I actually threw these away. I was so disappointed !! Since then I have tried a couple of the other noodle bowls and a soup bowl and have really liked them so it isnt the Annie Chun's products but this particular noodle bowl. I have read a couple of the more recent reviews on this product on Amazon and their facebook page and was relieved to see it wasnt just me. That other people had noticed this overpowering lemony taste. Seems they havent always been like this though. One gentleman stated that he had compaired the ingredient label of a new batch and an old batch and it seems they have changed some of the ingredients. Annie, if you read this, go back to the old way because pretty soon no one is going to be buying these.",1
"For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Chef Paul Prudhomme's Magic Pepper Sauce has set itself apart from the others as being one that I do not find to be striking.  I tried this hot sauce awhile back, and all I remember is that even though it was not terrible, it was not pleasing, either.  Recently, I was given another bottle of it and decided to give it another shot--I still think that it is just okay.  It is not too mild and not too hot, and it has a sugary flavor that I am not pleased with.  Overall, I consider this to be a dull hot sauce.  I am still glad that I tried it, though.  Actually, I rate this hot sauce 2.5 stars.",2
"With only 5 grams of sugar per serving, it isn't the greatest eaten alone, but it isn't bad. The small and loose nature of the product makes it difficult to just eat plain as well. If I were going for something I could eat out of the bag as a snack, this won't be a top choice but is an OK option.<br /><br />It does make a good ""cereal"" when mixed with milk, albeit very expensive for that purpose. I found its best niche in our household is mixed with yogurt. We are trying to get our kids a wider variety in their diets and this stuff sprinkled in yougurt is a great way for us to do that. The bag is tough enough to allow you to break up bigger clusters with you hands so that it sprinkles in easily. My 7 year old son likes to eat them plain as well.<br /><br />The ingredients as listed are excellent and the product is labeled as being gluten free. There are 11 serving per 11 ounce package and each has only 5 grams of sugar. It has a good amount of fiber (5 grams) and some protein (3 grams). Labeled as having 750mg of Omega 3, which likely comes from the ground flax seeds.<br /><br />Pricewise it is at the higher end of the spectrum but not neccesarily way out of line with what you might find a similar product for in a grocery store. Just for comparison purposes I did pick up another like product (vanilla almond crunch with ground flax seeds labeled under the brand ""Bear Naked"") at the local Wal-mart. It was about 60% the cost of this product. Very similar overall specs although more reliant on oats. I did find the taste of the unmixed KIND product better and think it has a slightly more varied ingredient list with the Amaranth and Quinoa. But in yogurt the taste advantage was not noticeable. Both to me are fine for what our nutritional needs are.<br /><br />Overall this is a good tasting healthy product, that allows us to get our kids some better things into their meals then box cereals.",4
I give me dog one of these and he goes right in his crate.  It's great for training.  I will also give him one to reward him for doing something good.  He loves milkbones.,5
"When I was in Italy for a year, I drank Illy on a daily basis.  I bought this can to use with my Bialetti moka pot at home.  It smells AMAZING when you open the jar, and once percolated tastes pretty delicious.  It is a bit overpriced with shipping, though.",3
My husband has had to have gluten free food for several years.  We have tried several different bread mixes and this is the first that he actually enjoys.  Buying it on Amazon saves me between $1.50 to $2.00 a loaf!,5
"I have a very hard time finding a moisterizer.  I have a very oily t-zone while the rest of my face is dry to the point of flakey.  A word of caution if you already have oily prone skin... This created more oil.  I only used it at night and when I woke the next morning I was shoked at the sheen of oil covering my entire face.  I was disgusted.  Granted, it didn't appear to clog pores, nor make my acne worse (I am an unfortunate sufferer of that infamous adult acne around the mouth and chin area).<br /><br />A nice thing about this moisterizer is it was extremely refreshing after applying.  Especially those nights following a toner that can sometimes leave that sting behind.  I love the smell of it too.  I have since switched to only applying it outside of my t-zone, and while I still discover oil the next morning, it isn't near as bad as before.<br /><br />I am on the hunt for a new moisterizer, as I probably won't continue to use this.  Unfortunately there just aren't a lot of moisterizers with green tea, which is what I was looking for.",3
"Yuck, Brownie jumps back whenever I try to let him smell it. When I put it on his food, he refuses to eat and backs away from his food bowl. I bought the Bacon and Roast Beef flavor, but he doesn't like any of them. He's not a picky dog, so it must really be gross. nice idea, but won't work if dogs won't go near it.",2
"A good anytime coffee. More on the lighter roast side,smooth and not bitter. Good flavor,my go to coffee. Best in an eight ounce cup.",4

"[...]<br /><br />This is a great ""pick me up"" for afternoons!! Nice blend of salt and sweetness in one treat. I would recommend to anyone.",5
I'm not a vegan but eat mostly fish and veggies.  I've eaten many other similar kinds of products and it's a shame this so bad because it would make people just venturing into non-dairy or gluten free eating feel very apprehensive if not downright scared.  I actually had to throw the entire pot out after one taste.  I even put a bit of special salt and butter type product in to make it better.  As  my granddaughter would say.... Icky!  Maybe I will try some other items of theirs to see if I can find something nice to say :-),1
"I was under the impression, ordering two, that I would have received more than just two individual packages for the $11 I paid.",2
"I order this for my husband who has dry eyes. At first we were skeptical as to if it would really work. Well, it does! He noticed an immediate improvement if used regularly. After a while results diminish though, so he takes a break and then starts using it again to get results.",4
"The price was very good, but I guess I know why.  I gave it 1 star because it's low in carbs and another because it's edible.  There is a distinct foul odor when you open the bag for the first time.  After airing the bag out, the first piece I tasted was like chewing shoe leather, dry and chewy without much flavor.  After the 2nd piece, the meat began to leave a bad chemical aftertaste.  I understand everyone's taste buds will be different so do yourself a favor and buy a small bag of this at Walmart before getting the big bags here.",2
I tried a double boxes of this when the Donut Shop  coffee I usually order was unavailable.  While the coffee is pretty good the cups suck.  A full 1/3 of the cups brewed are undrinkable.  They are slow to brew(coffee maker has to work very hard) and even then the cup retains an inordinate amount of water.  Checking some of the cups that left grounds in the brew showed that the filter was not properly installed.  They could sell these at half the price listed and you still would pay too much due to all the wasted coffee.  I believe we all have experienced a defective cup here or there but these are way beyond acceptable.,1

"It's rare to find unsweetened cranberries. I have yet to use them in a recipe, so my comments will be limited to initial impressions: they're pretty dry. I found that I could soak them in a little water, and I add Splenda for sweetening (cranberries are extraordinarily bitter, otherwise) they become palatable and tasty. I bought them because of a dietary malabsorption problem with sugars.",3
"I've been feeding my cats science diet for probably 3-4 years and the one thing they've had in common over time is that the reseal freshness ""lock"" seems to always be flawed in some way. I've used this sealing technology on lots of food and non-food containers for probably 20 years so I think the common denominator here is Science Diet. Someone at Science Diet probably needs to look at the QA results for their bags and figure out how to create a working ""lock"" that seals.<br /><br />I've resorted to just pouring the contents out into a large jug and feeding Sassy and Hoshi from there.",1
"This product is listed when you search ""Arrowhead Mills Gluten Free."" It is not gluten free, as it contains two ingredients that are wheat-based - Organic Wheat Flour, Organic Whole Wheat Flour.

"This sampler is good, but all potential buyers should know in advance that the description of the assortment is totally wrong. You won't get any jasmine tea, lemon spice, sushi bar mild green, or some of the other flavors mentioned in the ad. What you will get is several varieties of green tea (including organic, decaf, and a green/white and green/black blend) plus Moroccan mint, a green chai, and ginger peach. When I contacted Amazon to tell them that their description was wrong, they just said that they get their descriptions from several different vendors and don't have a way to confirm if they're right or wrong.",3
"My 70+ pound puppy loves this bone, and it's been months since I bought it. The mint stuffing was gone within a couple hours of course. The nice thing about this kind of bone is that you can freshen it up in lots of ways - stuff in a piece of cheese, spritz some spray butter (or even Pam) on it, pour the dregs of your vegetable soup on it, etc., and the dog will fall in love with it again and again. :)",4
"I ordered these and recieved Quaker 5-Minutes Quick Grits instead of Old Fashioned.  No problem returning them (other than the hassle), but not what I was expecting",1
"I mixed this bag in with my Kashi cereal and am enjoying the combination.  The clusters aren't too large, the cinnamon isn't overpowering, and it gives a nice flavor to the Kashi.  I would readily use this to make Granola Bread, except I dumped the whole bag into the cereal, so I can't.  I think it would work quite well.  I also think it would be very good as part of home-made trail mix, with raisins and M&Ms and the like.  Depending on price at my local grocery store, I'd buy this.",3
"Saw this and immediately ordered! The Jolly Time illustration (logo) shows the item to be lite but it's not lite; it's the regular. I brought this to Amazon's attention and they refunded my payment. It's good popcorn but we wanted the lite which I think is sold only direct from Jolly Time - no grocery stores. So, in a crazy sense it's not a five because I didn't get what I wanted. On the other hand I was treated great by Amazon so I kinda settled on a 3.",3
"This product lists equivalency in drops, yet the packaging is not a dropper style bottle nor does it have any type of dropper applicator. The equivalency is also very wrong, it is not nearly as sweet as it labels itself to be. It also has a bitter after-taste that I have not had with other sucralose based liquid sweeteners.",1
"This is an absolutely great tasting tea. It has lots of flavor and just smells good even before you taste it. You can enjoy it with out sugar or sweetners (neither is good for you). It has a calming effect and does not contain caffine. A friend in Washington, D.C. turned me onto it, I went shoping for it as soon as I got home to the Bay Area. I continue to not only buy more but also to throughly enjoy it and turning others onto African Nectar from Mighty Leaf.",5
"My son eats these for a snack now.  The grain in this makes it a little more textured, so I'm guessing that's why this is not my son's favorite ""pouch"" flavor, but he still seems to like it okay.  He loves the fruits that are in this one.",3
"This vendor is clearly attempting to take advantage of consumers.  A 4 pack used to be sold for about $20 and has since doubled in price.  If you look elsewhere on the Interned, you can find a MUCH better price.  I just placed an order for the same product with iHerb.com.  A DOZEN 7.33 oz cans only cost me $68,97 and is being shipped 1-3 day for free.",1
"We used these hash browns camping on a wilderness camping and fishing trip. They tasted as good as if they where fresh grated from potatoes. I recommend for home as well as any camping trip. So easy to make. Hydrated with boiling water for twelve minutes in the existing container, then fried up with a bit of oil. WOW, very great product.",5
"I used this once. It works.  My hair is stronger, slightly darker and softer.  My concern is what is in this product?  What types of chemicals or pesticides were sprayed on the herbs?  How pure is the oil?  The product does not have an herbal scent but rather a chemical smell.  What is in this?  I worry because the scalp absorbs products readily and these things end up in your bloodstream....that includes any hair dye and shampoos you use.  The ingredients are especially important here because we are supposed to leave this on overnight  thus giving the scalp a lot of exposure to some unknown ingredients.  Keep in mind that the chemicals and pesticides that were banned in the US years ago are shipped to third world nations and frequently re-imported into this country via these types of products.  I don't know what is in this and it may be great but I am concerned about the smell...it is not a natural scent.",2
These are really good!  They are soft and have just the right amount of sweetness.,5
Go to Bell Plantation's web site and get a 4 pack for the same price.  I made the mistake of not shopping around...  You can get this for a much better price.,1
I have only recently discovered a love for Chai Tea but it could be only a certain brand. I really enjoy the Celestial Seasonings brand Chai which has more body and well-blended flavor. This had such a strong cinnamon flavor and it was more the oil-type not the cinnamon stick type. None of the other flavors stood out at all to me. I really like cinnamon but it reminded me of the cinnamon toothpicks we made when I was a kid. I haven't had much experience with other types of Chai so I can't much of a comparison.,2
"These don't taste like cardboard, thankfully; they have a pleasant, subtle almost nutty flavor, as if peanut butter is in them. However, the texture, even in the center of the cookie, is not moist at all!! I was hoping the outside would be slightly crunchy while the inside was softer and moist. They also crumble easily. They are alright but nothing I'd purchase again.",3
This hard candy has a hole on each side so you can suck the fizziness out.  Definitely satisfies an oral fixation with fewer calories than chocolate.  And it's acceptable to eat at work.  The package arrives very quickly.  Just wish I could get free shipping; then I would order a lot more.,5
I am a little dis appointed with this tea --  This was my first experience with loose tea --  initially this was good loose tea ---  after having tried for several months  -- I am dis appointed -- first it is a weak tea  --  I have tried brewing it  for long time changing my water settings and brew times and I keep getting same result  a weak tea  -- the amt of tea --  I just never seem to get the right mix  --,3
The order was much anticipated since I love wintergreen and it is hard to find.  Sadly this example leaves me still looking for a source.  The candy was a little gummy and had a lingering after-taste that I can only describe as soapy.,3
This coffee is a treat with dessert and nice on those cold winter days. There is something warm and comforting about this coffee.,4
"I was pretty excited to receive this flavor, as Kahlua is one of my favorite flavors.  Upon making the coffee, my wife walked through the kitchen and asked if a skunk has sprayed outside of the window.  The coffee gives off a VERY strong aroma when brewed.  If you like a strong cup of coffee, this one is for you.  As the earlier poster stated, I didn't get much of the Kahula flavor that I was hoping for.  Not sure if I'll even use up the cups due to the aroma that is created when brewing. Out of all of the flavors I have tried, this is probably the worst.",2
"I absolutely love these gummy worms (and the gummy bears). The texture is super yummy, and they are not overly sweet (since they are made with natural sweeteners) which doesn't give me a stomach ache like conventional ones. These fulfill my craving for chewy candy without the guilt, and they are fair trade and organic- which both support good causes. I can't see where you can go wrong with these! Also, the slightly higher price is worth it since (like i previously mentioned) they are healthy, yummy, and for a good cause!!",5
"Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water is very refreshing and delicious.  I drink a lot of bottled water, and I'm very particular when it comes to taste.  This brand tastes better than most.  It ranks right up there with popular French brands when it comes to flavor.  I also enjoy that I can get a good electrolyte drink without calories or sugary taste.  There are times when I just don't want a sugary drink but I do need the added benefit of an electrolyte boost.  I'll try this brand again.",5
"The ingredients in this seems to be better then ""Fancy Feast"" which is mostly fat. I have one finicky cat and one who will eat anything. Both love it. It is a good every other day [half way healthy] treat for them.",5
"I'm clearly in the minority here, as Darjeeling is not one of my favorite Bigelow varieties.  It is a good tea, and I enjoy drinking it, and I would never be unhappy if someone served it to me.  In fact, I do keep some in my house, and brew up a cup every couple weeks or so.  But Darjeeling isn't one of my top tier Bigelow favorites, and there are several others I drink more frequently.<br /><br />This is strictly a black tea (which is what I most prefer), without any additions, although when I do my teabag deep sniff (my favorite moment with any tea, right after I rip open a foil bag!) with Darjeeling, there is a hint of what is almost a lemon scent.  There is no lemon added to this tea, but it's interesting that the scent is there, particularly as another reviewer says this is the only tea he doesn't ""have"" to add lemon to.<br /><br />The flavor is quite good, but my main complaint is that it is weaker, or more mellow, than I prefer.  When I drink Darjeeling, I find myself wishing there was more of the flavor present.  It is often described as ""rich"" or ""robust"" but I think there are other straight black teas that better meet those terms.<br /><br />If you also find Darjeeling a little mellow for your tastes, I suggest you try the Bigelow English Breakfast (don't confuse this with the Bigelow English Teatime!) variety, which is also a straight black tea.<br /><br />I always drink tea straight--no sugar, no honey, no lemon, no milk!  So my reviews are my opinions of the straight tea flavor, not how it interacts with another agent.  I drink Bigelow tea almost exclusively, because it's readily available, modestly priced, and has lots of varieties that are all of decent quality.  If I give a Bigelow flavor less stars, it reflects only my taste preference, and is not a statement of low product quality.",4
"In buying organic canned corn I am making a tradeoff.  I prefer fresh but that means trucking the corn in form where ever and then it would not have that sweet tasting fresh picked.  So this corn is the next best thing, with a clean taste that really suggests fresh.  I put this in with some root vegetables and I taste late summer all over again.",2
"These might work well for training, but they are way to tiny for a treat - you have to give them a whole handful. I was disappointed.",2
"My dog loves peanut butter, but she really didnt like this particular treat.  I've given her Zuke's beef treats and she liked it very much, so thought would try peanut butter.  She tolerates one a day (I'm giving it to her for the glucomasine part) but thats it.  Will go back to beef after this bag runs out.  Just a heads up!  I still like Zukes' products tho!",3
The product contains cottonseed oil which is almost certainly genetically modified. I won't eat them because of that likelihood.,1
I had bought other protein water that was more expensive and had a bad taste; special k is less expensive and has a very good taste. I like to use it before and during my workout; it is just enough to keep me going through tough cardio or weight training early in the am. I have a reusable water bottle that I use and that works well for me. You can also add it to a regular spring water bottle as well when you are out and about. I would recemmend this product.,5
"Hate to give a bad review but hopefully people who are at least sensitive to this brand will find benefit and avoid this item:<br /><br />I was raised with Seafood and used to eating caviar/roes and was very happy with some of the Romanoff purchases but I got sick off of this brand.<br />Almost like a bacteria attack on my body and really bad feeling and I'm a very fit guy.  I tried the Capelin because it was from the same Icelandic environment like Romanoff and similar brands and couldn't beat the pricing with what looks like a great ""fancy"" packaging and opted out of my Salmon choice to try a new type of fish.  Ultimately a Very Bad Idea especially if someone would have been older with a weaker immune system. Stick with the familiar fish over this one.<br /><br />Caveat Emptor on this Caviar!!!",1

"Our cats seem to love this much more than other treats we've been using. However, it made one of them vomit in two different instances, immediately after eating this. Obviously this is not the case with other reviewers here, but I thought I should point that out in case someone else is having the same experience.",3
"Great product.  Easy to have on hand.  My 2 year old thinks it's fun to have a ""Milk Box"".",5
"The berry flavor was okay on first bite, but then the after taste hit. Couldn't eat but maybe half of bar. Not sure what I will do with the rest now.",1
Finally a strong cup of coffee.  I found that I had a lot of coffee grounds in the bottom of the cup.  Also some of the foil was misaligned allowing coffee grounds to spill throughout the box.,1
"We make popcorn 2-3 times a week, on the stovetop using coconut oil.  We typically use Redenbacher, but are always interested in finding something better or more interesting.  This is not it.<br /><br />First of all, the unpopped kernel sizes vary widely, compared to Redenbacher where they are roughly uniform.  There is also a great deal of popcorn dust in the bags - loose husks, kernel bits, etc.  Neither would be deal killers if the popcorn was good.<br /><br />But it isn't.  It pops very unevenly, some are fluffy and light, others are harder and chewy, some are half-popped, and it leaves many more unpopped and half-popped kernels than Redenbacher.<br /><br />Also note that per Amazon policy, this item is not returnable, so we'll eventually work our way through all six bags, but we won't enjoy it very much.",2
"We'd gotten these beans before, and they're excellent quality with fine taste, particularly for the cost per pound.<br /><br />However, for some unknown reason, the most recent order just chews my wife's stomach up. She also says they taste acidic to her. I drink my coffee with milk, so they taste fine to me and and I've had no problems, but I have a mostly cast-iron stomach anyway.<br /><br />So they're sitting on the shelf right now and we're drinking other kinds of coffee that don't give my wife nausea, pain, or heartburn.<br /><br />If you have a sensitive stomach, be careful. If you don't, give 'em a try.",3
"Oddly this trap is catching all flies...no yellow jackets. I know they are around..is the bait the same as the fly catchers?<br /><br />So, like my review of the fly catchers-this trap will STINK from feet away when half full like feces so you wont want it around sitting/food areas like patios. We love that they are disposable but DOUBLE BAG it first or your trash can will reak. Even when they catch bees, traps do smell badly. So we expected this. Why we switched to disposable vs re-use.<br /><br />Easy to use, good price. They dont catch the good bees like Bumbles.",3
"I have a small counter top popcorn popper. This is the perfect size for it. Taste great, nearly every one pops, and great to season anyway you like. Goes well with our movie nights.",5
these came perfectly packaged and are beautiful. but are waaayyy too expensive. i thought i would get much more than i did for the price.,3
"Yes, it's a poor excuse for a soup; yes, it has only 100 calories. It's pretty vile; the calories do nothing to redeem it. Squeeze a small tomato into a glass of water and it would have even fewer calories and taste about as good, maybe better.<br /><br />But why did they call it 'southwestern-style'? The only indication I see of the southwest is that they threw in a few beans--maybe nine or ten; there's certainly no seasoning that would warrant the name. The dominant vegetable, and the overwhelmiingly dominant flavor, is celery--not exactly what I'd call southwestern cooking's signature ingredient.<br /><br />As for the amazing 100 calories, a serving of Campbell's Condensed Tomato Soup (1/2 can, diluted) contains roughly 120 calories, tastes much better, and is more substantial, even if it is 4.5 ounces less by volume.",1
This is the only gluten free spaghetti that my son eats.  I like the mix of grains in it.,5
"The first bite was honey sweet, then granola wave then a recall of ohoy's chocolate chip cookies without the chocolate chips. For all the healthy attire, the thins have taste. The fig tinies can get sticky. I do not like the fig crisps of Newtons but I liked this.<br />But the price, for the new fangled fig looking packaging is unbelievable. I did rather buy dried figs from Sprouts and feel lot more healthy and righteous.",3
"A dear friend of mine is on a gluten free diet, so I opted to try the sample of Peacock brand Brown Rice Vermicelli for her sake. She has tried lots of various gluten free vermicellis and has been disappointed by most.<br /><br />I've never cooked vermicelli in my life, let alone a rice vermicelli, so this was going to be a big experiment for us both.<br /><br />The package states it will make 3.5 servings, and they are right on the mark with that - full, deep soupbowl servings. There are two recipes on the back of the bag, both of which were enticing, but I didn't have all the ingredients for either, so I used what I had - grapeola oil and butter, minced garlic, roasted red pepper, and some sauvignon blanc, with fresh grated parmesan to sprinkle over.<br /><br />The only problem I had, due to lack of experience, was that I paid attention to the brief directions on the bag which said to ""soften brown rice vermicelli in water at room temperature for 1 minute prior to cooking."" I did this, and that's how the sauvignon blanc got quickly added to the frying pan after adding the noodles. They were still too hard and dry. In the future I would heat up some broth to just below simmer, then add the noodles for a minute - this way they would soften better and pick up additional flavor.<br /><br />However, my white wine rescue was successful, and although the vermicelli was a little chewy, it held and mixed the flavors very well. My friend said they were the best rice noodles she has come across yet, and she has tried a lot of different varieties. Because they cook up so quickly, she could grab a healthy meal with these noodles (and a few ingredients) before caving in to something bad for her digestion. She urged me to bring the bag to our nearest grocery store to see if they can find it and stock it for her.<br /><br />I was really pleased to have found yet one more healthy gluten free food item to support her well-being.",4
"This toy billed to keep dogs entertained for hours lasted my dog 20 min.<br /><br />Be very careful with this toy. My boy ended up swallowing a big piece which made him sick and resulted in a very expensive trip to the vet. Fortunately it did not cause a blockage, but I'm not taking the risk.",1
"I've enjoyed this tea for years. However, when I last bought some from my local Indian store I couldn't decipher the code on the box. I was looking for a ""best before"" date stamp and there was none. Sadly, I had to throw the tea out because it was old. I'd buy again, but only as long as I understand how fresh it is.",4
"I'm rather ignorant about plants, I will admit... but I was a little disappointed when I received this plant only to realize that it's an  outdoor plant.  At least I assume that it is because it came with an ""Outdoor Bonsai Care"" pamphlet.  It doesn't say anywhere in the description on here that it's an outdoor plant.  It is a beautiful plant but I don't have an outdoor area to keep it in so I'm going to wind up giving it to a friend.",4
"My cat loves Fancy Feast catfood.  However, all five of the Fancy Feast subscriptions I signed up for have been unreliable.  Im October, I signed up for delivery every two months and received shipments only in October and December (it's now March 18, but I canceled all of my subscriptions yesterday).  What was supposed to be 48-can cases Amazon turned into 24-can cases, with one flavor being canceled entirely.  I was notified by Amazon that shipments would be sent in mi-February, but they never arrived.",2
"I have purchased Bob's products for years and enjoy all of them.  They are high-quality! I eat oatmeal everyday and use Muesli as an add-in to the plain old-fashioned type. It is generously packed with almonds, raisins and dates. Yum! I've also eaten it cold with Almond milk and enjoy it that way too.",5
This is the stuff they use at Starbucks to make their chai tea lattes. So much cheaper! Just add milk and you have a drink that would normally cost you $4.00.,5
"I wasn't wild about these at first, but they grew on me.  The pepper is a bit overpowering after the first few bites....it sneaks up on you.  However, after eating them several times I enjoyed them more.  My chief complaint is with the plastic packaging.  Although very convenient, it is wasteful and environmentally unfriendly.  PLEASE recycle the canisters!",4
"I love these cookies, generally, and the price is great here on Amazon, but sometimes I question where they come from.  In March, I received a shipment (TWELVE boxes) with an expiration date of 12 March 2011.  I thought that was kinda ""iffy"", and the cookies were a bit worn (they had that patina of old chocolate), but they were edible, so, okay.  In April, the expiration date was sometime in the far future (September or October of 2011), so I figured the March shipment was a fluke.  In May, the expiration date was *again* 12 March 2011!!  They were PAST expiration.<br /><br />Of course, I'm a carb freak so that didn't stop me from eating them, but, C'MON!!  I'm almost scared to get my next shipment.",2
"I have tried so many K cups I can't keep track of them all, but the Hazelnut from Gloria Jean's is still my all time fave.",5
"""The Red One"", organic baby food ""smoothie""<br /><br />If you're like me, you're interested in this item because it looks convenient and like something your baby will actually eat -- that would be a pretty good description of this product, with a few caveats:<br /><br />-The nutrition content of this product is not really that great.  We tend to mix this in with rice cereal for some iron, but otherwise it's a bit of a waste on its own.<br />-The taste is good, but maybe a little sweet for baby.<br />-The packaging is great -- very portable, screw top cap.  You tend not to waste much product with the packaging design.<br /><br />Just a reminder, the container is a bit smaller than some of the other ""bagged"" baby foods:  3 oz is less than the plastic Gerber containers (at 3.5 oz), but more than the small glass jar foods (usually 2.5 oz).",3
I have three dogs and they all love these treats.  Leave it to Paul Newman!  :-),5
"I contacted Happy Bellies after purchasing what appeared to be a bad can at my local target. They responded within one business day. Below is an excerpt of their response to me. I thought other parents would appreciate this information.<br /><br />""I can tell you that this is a wholly organic, minimally processed product, and as such, it's subject to slight changes in the organic crop year, season, etc.  Also, since this is drum dried (thin film on a hot steel rolling dryer), changes in drum temp can occasionally cause more browning than normal.  Also, this product (BELLIES cereal) is on what's called a ""positive release"" program, which means that product cannot be released for sale until the required testing comes back acceptable.  The fact that it was for sale tells me it passed those tests...<br />Right now, I feel as though rough handling (trucks, forklifts, shelf stockers, etc.) has caused damage, most likely leading to a seam leak.  Since we flush the can with nitrogen, a seam leak allows air (oxygen) into the can, which can cause a set of oxidation reactions.  These are responsible for off flavours/colours/odours, but other than that, are harmless, and do not pose a food safety threat to your son.""<br /><br />I believe in this product and their commitment to customers. Hopefully they will resolve these issues soon, but knowing that the product is safe is most important to me--even if the color is off.",4
"I ordered these chew sticks thinking they were Jumbo in size.  Found they were not and my dog can chew them up in less than 15 minutes.  The Jumbo bully sticks I find locally are about 3 fingers in thickness with the same length as those sold here (12"") and take a couple of days to chew.  Not at all what I expected for $90.00.  Will be going with Merrick or local from now on.",2
This KIND bar is pretty intense.  The chocolate and cherry combo create a really strong flavor. The palm kernal oil ingredient in the chocolate is a concern as that oil is not said to be very healthy.,3
Ordered two cases because of good reviews.  Both cases due to expire in several months.  Obviously they sent me old stock.<br />Tastes nasty!!  DO NOT BUY.,1
"Sorry but unlike some of the other flavors by Cesar, my dog won't go near it. I ended up giving it to a friend of mine for her less picky dog.",2
"This is a very drinkable blend of Assam, Ceylon, and Kenyan black teas from PG Tips, one of the UK's most popular brands. Although some California grocery stores stock this tea, I had not tried it until reading helpful reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Each PG Tips bag weighs 38 percent more than the Lipton bag (that is available in the USA). As expected, PG Tips makes a stronger brew. Each PG Tips bag has so much tea that I can easily make a 12 ounce mug with a single bag.<br /><br />PG Tips is a sturdy, straight-ahead blend with more strength than Lipton's. It is a caffeine-rich tea - in part because each bag has more tea than other brands.<br /><br />PG Tips uses a pyramid shaped bag that allows more room for tea leaves to expand while steeping. Does it make better tea? I don't know, but it is a point of differentiation.<br /><br />HINT: PG Tips also makes a Special Blend black tea that is only slightly more expensive in stores. I much prefer the Special Blend to their regular black tea. The PG Tips Special Blend is a very hardy and rich breakfast tea. The Special Blend is more sensitive to longer steeping times (I usually steep mine less than 3 minutes), but I find the taste more complex and satisfying.<br /><br />Many prefer loose tea because tea bags contain the less expensive ""fannings"" or ""dust,"" remains from processing loose leaf tea. And with some others brands of tea (not PG Tips), some people can taste the paper used in the bag.<br /><br />If you (like I) sometimes appreciate the convenience of bags, I recommend trying PG Tips as a sturdy everyday tea. And, I more strongly recommend their Special Blend as a hardy and rich breakfast tea.",4
"these chips are good, and bad, and create moral dilemmas constantly. If wou are strong at will, or having a large BBQ go for it, but as for me, i was in the habit of bringing a new bag to work every three days, had to put in a lot of time on the treadmill to make up for it. BEWARE",4
"Arrived early, 3 days early which was a pleasent surprise! Came in good condition, good packaging. Was the 4 inch pot but the plant was a lot smaller then advertised in picture... its maybe 6 inches tall but with healthy looking leaves so I'm not too disapointed. Hopefully it will grow fast.",3
"Sweet potatoes are among my favorite vegetables, and I especially adore sweet potato chips. So an Amazon Vine offer of these chips seemed a sure bet.<br /><br />They taste a bit like sweet potatoes, yet ever so slightly sweeter --- with fewer calories and half the fat of a bag of real sweet potato chips (100 calories, 30% from fat, compared to 130 calories with half from fat in a regular bag of chips).<br /><br />But I agree with others. The taste is slightly strange --- and the ingredients tell why. The key ingredient isn't sweet potato, but RICE FLOUR! Sweet potato flakes (whatever those are) come second, then tapioca starch. Next comes oil (sunflower, safflower, or canola) then yellow corn flour. And finally there's cane syrup --- sugar --- which explains why the chips seem a tad sweeter than sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I like these Sweet Potato Popchips well enough, and will keep the box at the ready for brown bag lunches over the next several weeks.<br /><br />I may buy them again, too --- but only if no real sweet potato chips are available to satisfy my sweet potato tooth.",4
"I don't know where to start. I feel like cheated. This product is described as ""Pure Premium Coconut Water"" but it tastes more like little bit of coconut oil mixed with water and served in a cheap plastic container. This product does not at all taste like coconut water. When you take a sip the first thing it reminds you of is ""Plastic"".<br /><br />I have tried many brands of coconut water and this by far is the WORST. I have grown up drinking coconut water fresh from the shell. So I know the real taste. See my  review for ""Vita Coco"".<br /><br />I had seen all the recent negative reviews. But they all suggested that there was a problem with one particular batch. I also noticed that Amazon had stopped selling this to investigate the problems reported in recent bad reviews. So when this product again came up for sell I trusted that Amazon has addressed the issue. I was always attracted to the packaging and wanted to try this for some time. Plus there was 15% off coupon. So I went ahead and ordered a case. Big Mistake!!<br /><br />Amazon does not accept returns for this product. So only thing I can do is ""vent it out"" through this review. This is my first negative review and I believe Zico absolutely deserve NO STARS. I am giving one star because Amazon does not allow zero stars.<br /><br />BTW, the case I received has expiry date of Dec 2011. I want to see reviews from other shoppers who have bought this along with me.",1
These cookies are great!  Don 't really get alot of good stuff when going gluten free.,5
"I have never had worst product.  It was extremely hard and tasteless.  I can't believe that I paid so much for it.  I gave it two stars instead of one so people will read this review.  Of course I couldn't return it because they call it food.  The package picture misrepresents the product.  Very little brown turkey,  I would never buy it at a store.  I will read the negative reviews first from now on, which were the truth, not the over abundance of five star.  I was going to say that I will never order food products again from Amazon but I have bought very good Stevia Chocolate before.",2
"There is rosemary in this, and it just doesn't seem to appeal to my cats, unfortunately. Other than that the item arrived in a timely manner, and the bottle was in good shape. The pump works well and it doesn't smell terrible. The concentration of DHA is great, but why the rosemary?? What animal wants to eat rosemary? I'd rather smell fish and have my cats enjoy eating it over their canned food.",2
"I was diagnosed as pre-hypertension several years ago. At the beginning I took the pills I was prescribed, but side effects including a super-sensibility to allergy put me in the position to stop the pills and look for an alternative natural way to deal with my high blood pressure. For several years I drank a chinese tea that I found in a local chinese grocery store but could not find it any more. In early january I traveled to San Francisco and found this amazing Triple Leaf Tea, this tea worked even better and most of all, it is available in Amazon any time I am about to run out of it. Thanks so much Triple Leaf and Amazon for helping me deal with my health.",4
"I've been using Cytomax while bicycling for about 10 years and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Before Cytomax, I mainly used Gatorade and I would often get very painful leg cramps on long rides, especially on hot days. Since switching to Cytomax, I get cramps only occasionally, usually when I'm not drinking enough.<br /><br />I mix 1.5 measures of Cytomax in a 24 ounce water bottle, which is less than the recommended amount. Some of the reviewers have mentioned that Cytomax doesn't dissolve easily, but if you should not have a problem if you add the Cytomax to a bottle that is half filled with water so that it doesn't clump, then shake the bottle vigorously, and then add water to fill the bottle. Before drinking give the bottle a few shakes to distribute anything that's settled to the bottom.<br /><br />Taste is the most important thing when selecting an energy drink. Whatever your choice, it doesn't have to taste great, but it does have to be acceptable. If you don't like the taste, then you probably won't be drinking enough and your performance will definitely suffer as a result. I use the Cool Citrus flavor. Over the years, I've gotten samples of other flavors, some of which were OK and some that I did like at all. So if you're unsure about the flavor, try to get a sample from someone before you buy a 1.5 or 4.5 pound container.<br /><br />On long rides, I carry two bottles on my bike. For very long rides, I'll also carry zip lock bags with measured amounts of Cytomax so I can refuel as needed.<br /><br />In Summary: A great product.",5
"Wow- I never thought I would say this, but these have too much chocolate. If you want a bit of extra fudge, go for the regular fudge filled cookies... these ones that also have chocolate cookie are just too much. Two cookies in and I had heart burn from the amount of sugar and chocolate in this cookie. If you are a super chocoholic then these might be right up your alley... but they were just too much chocolate for me.",3
"You watch your mouth!<br /><br />Simply, one of the best things I have ever eaten. Healthy organic blue corn chips with taste that packs a punch.<br /><br />I won't waste your time reading about these when you can be enjoying them instead. Just note that some bags seem to have a more generous allotment of cayenne pepper (the special ingredient that distinguishes Red Hot Blues from the standard Blue Chips). Or perhaps certain bags settle more during shipment, in which case the bulk of the cayenne dust is to be found at the bottom of the bag. You can always scoop up the loose seasoning and sprinkle on the chips (or any food! LOL) as you see fit.<br /><br />P.S. Amazon needs to figure out how to share reviews across products. In this case, for example, there are at least four different listings for Red Hot Blues. The only difference is the size of the bag or the quantity of bags that are bundled together. I am posting this review in those as well because other than one listing, none of the others have any reviews. Hopefully this will be of some help to customers, plus point them toward the main listing (the one with Free Shipping and sold directly from Amazon!).",5
"Everything I have tasted from Nature's Path co.,is great tasting and good for you.I went thru 12 boxes my first order,in a  month!!.My second order 12 but the net weight one the  1sts order were 11 oz. I just got 12 in bags that are 26oz.Just a great product as are all.",5
"I gave this to my Dad who had just returned from a trip to Turkey, along with a Turkish cookbook.  He's enjoyed both as reminders of his amazing trip.",4
"First, I really like the taste and texture of this cereal.  While other reviewers did not care for the vanilla taste, I personally like it.  ""Natural vanilla flavor"" is 8th in a list of 14 ingredients.  For me, the flavor is just right.<br /><br />Second, I frequently choose Chex mix as my ""snack of choice"" while watching TV in the evening.  This cereal would be a much better choice for me.  Comparing the 1/2 cup serving of Sweet'n Salty Chex Mix to the 2/3 cup serving of Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise, I find that:<br />* Vanilla Sunrise is Gluten Free, Chex Mix isn't (or doesn't advertise that it is)<br />* Vanilla Sunrise has 1 g of fat (no trans fat, no saturated fat), Chex Mix has3.5g of fat (no trans fat, .5g saturated fat)<br />* Vanilla Sunrise has 3 g of fiber, Chex Mix has 1<br />* Vanilla Sunrise does have more sugars: 7g to Chex Mix's 4 g<br /><br />Finally, as a breakfast cereal, this fails when compared to most of the vitamin- and mineral-rich breakfast cereals that are out there.  Even the kid-friendly Cap'n Crunch has more to offer when it comes to vitamins, A, C, and iron:<br />* Vanilla Sunrise has 0%, 0%, and 4% of vitamins A, C, and iron, respectively, compared to 10%, 10%, and 25% in Kellogg's Frosted Flakes<br /><br />So, Vanilla Sunrise wins as a snack, but loses as a breakfast (depending on what you look for in a morning meal)",4
"These weren't awful, they just weren't good. The combination of flavors is actually nice because you can't go wrong without chocolate and coconut, but the texture just ruins it all. I do understand that often gluten free baking has its obstacles to overcome, but these bars feel like they want to be cake-like but wind up powdery and almost tough at the same time. Basically, they have the sort of texture one imagines a ""gluten free"" product would have (although it doesn't have to be this way!) And while I love almonds, their presence only adds to the unpleasant feeling this bar has in the mouth.<br />Luckily, I'm not gluten free, but if I were I imagine these would be nice in a pinch though I wouldn't seek them out just to have around.",3
"This is a very unique product. The taste is different, but very good. I'm addicted to them. My mother had these when I was a kid, so they are not only an excellent, unique hard candy, but they are also a childhood memory for me.",4
"I was excited to try a new brand of granola, but was not impressed with this product. Similar to a previous review, I found virtually no chocolate in the entire box. I also found very few almonds, and the product itself was too sugary. I would not buy this granola again, and would not recommend it to others if you are expecting ""dark chocolate almond"" granola.",2
"It's always great to find a special product, and Marley Coffee is just such a find.  The pods are handy, and organic is a good thing as is Fair Trade.  I'm going to disagree, however, with the reviewer who found the coffee too weak if the pods are used like tea bags.  I found just the opposite.  The coffee produced in my machine was far weaker than that produced when I just stuck the pod in the cup and poured boiling water over it.  The result from the ""tea-bagging"" approach was strong and a little more acid than I like, but it had a good coffee flavor.  In the machine I got more of a ""coffee-flavored water"" result even when I used three pods together.<br /><br />It's worth a try if you have a single-serve machine and it's a handy way to carry your own coffee on trips as it truly does do fairly well in either machine or tea-bag use.  I suspect the flavor will be a matter of personal taste, so give it a try and decide for yourself.  There are other Fair Trade organic coffees out there, but this is the first I've come across in pods.",3
"I've had problems with coyotes, wild hares, skunks, opossums, gophers, mice, and neighbors' cats messing up my front/backyard lawns and gardens. I spread this <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016PC4TS"">Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent, 5-Pounds Granular Shaker</a> around areas where I've seen those critters frequent and caused damage. After about two weeks, I haven't seen any new damage caused by those annoying critters/intruders.  The granules are easy to dispense; similar to a giant pepper shaker. The granules' aroma is not too offensive; smells like strong black pepper and doesn't bother our family or guests.  The only drawback is the rather high cost of $27.50/5 lbs.; I've already used about half the container to apply one application to my front and backyards. The claims of rain-resistance and 30 days effectiveness remains to be seen.",4
This is a good pod coffee.  Senseo pods are good for everyday use.  This one does taste like Kona,4
"This is my first bag of chai tea and I have to say, it's extremely strong if you try to drink this straight. I can barely taste the tea itself, just a bit of bitter, and an extremely strong spice taste.<br /><br />It gets better if you water it down a lot, or take it with a lot of milk (basically a chai tea latte), which I suppose is how it's supposed to be drunk. But you start losing the base tea and only get the other spices.",3
"I have 2 dogs of my own that I use to feed dry food only.  A friend of mine recommended adding in Olewo supplements to my dog's food. I hadn't really heard of supplements for pets but I did a little research and liked what I found. My dogs love to carrot supplements in their food! I have a smaller dog who is a picky eater and would refuse food sometime. After adding in the carrots to her food she went crazy and finished every bite. I am also feeding my dogs the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083QBWKU"">Olewo Dehydrated Red Beets Dog Food Supplement, 2.2-Pound</a>.

"I was looking forward to this one as a low-carb sweet treat, but I would not purchase it again.  Sooooooo sweet and not very chocolately.  Make sure to double the amount of water the recipe calls for otherwise it is completly undrinkable.  A sad disappointment.",1
"I bought this for my sister, and she really had a nice surprise when she received it. She likes guarana soda, which is very difficult to get at stores in the USA.",5
"This is my favorite gluten-free pasta.  When I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease my dietitian recommended Tinkyada.  I tried it and was very disappointed.  I avoided pastas altogether for a while.  A few weeks ago I went to the Old Spaghetti Factory with a friend and tried their gluten-free pasta.  I was beyond happy (my friend possibly thought I was insane... she just doesn't realize).  Afterwards, I went from specialty food store to specialty food store trying to find the pasta they used.  I am certain that it is Mrs. Leeper's.  It is very easy to cook and cooks rapidly.  The texture is fabulous and consistent.  It goes great with any sauce.  My personal favorite is a little browned butter and a generous helping of mizithra cheese.",5
"And their French Roast is the best they make, in my opinion.  Their Chai Latte is great too if you can find it.",5
"Excellent taste, smooth, easy going.  I like a mild drink to start my day and this is it.  Heartily endorse this coffee.",5
Products work great in Chex mix and by themselves.  Great for all celiac sufferers,4

"the product I ordered was not the product that was delivered.  It was about 13 oz less than expected.  As per the taste or anything else, I would not know.  I have not even opened it.  I thought about returning the product, but thought the shipping charges were not worth the trouble.",1
"I've only eaten the KIND bar once, and it was definitely not this flavor but I didn't realize it until I opened it up and tasted it.  I love mango. I love macadamia. But in this bar, together, they are not great.  It's not bad... just not my cup of tea. The mango is a little too artificial and I don't get the macadamia crunch so I would say try another flavor.",2
"This is the 1st time I've tried this flavor of loose tea from Davidson's Tea Bulk. I am enjoying it a lot. I like that it isn't pure mint tea, but a mix of complimentary flavors that give it an interesting taste.",4
"I received the package, but only received 42 K-Cups versus the advertised 50.<br /><br />Not sure what to do now...is this a common practice for these bulk shipments?",1
"I'm going to admit I'm a coffee addict but not a Starbucks fan.  Assuming you like Starbucks coffee (if you don't know...just go to a shop before you buy a package), this is a drip grind, medium strength.  It's definitely not a French/Dark roast.  It wouldn't hold cream well at all without over-powering it.<br /><br />That said, there is barely ANY vanilla taste to hit although the grounds have a strong vanilla aroma.  In general, a hazelnut coffee has about 3x the flavored taste as this does.  Yes I do realize vanilla is a much more subtle taste.<br /><br />I would recommend either adding a drop of vanilla extract, shot of vanilla syrup or vanilla cream to your already favorite cup of joe.",2
"I bought this as a gift for Christmas in a nice glass jar from Old Time Pottery. My boyfriend thought they would last forever but they were gone by March. People would come to his cubicle just to take a few. My only complaint is that 1/6 of the bag came stuck together. They easily broke apart but made one side of a lot of the beans flat. This was mailed in December but I guess the warm Georgia winter melted them in transit. For the price, I hoped that all of them would be intact. Taste was not compromised though. Yum!",4
"After reading the description about the healthy ingredients, I was disappointed to find that the protein items were still at the bottom of the list. While the corn may not be corn meal, as many other brands have, it is still the primary ingredient.<br /><br />My dogs did eat it without fuss. However, I noticed them returning to their food bin (we free feed) more often during the day. It was as though the food didn't quite satisfy. It could be they are used to food that has higher levels of protein. Eating more doesn't always mean liking it better. If I were to continue using this brand, I'm afraid my dogs would become overweight.<br /><br />I've seen the cute commercials with the happy, playful dogs. I wonder if they are really eating this product.",2
"I thought this product was pretty good.  My dog has allergies, so I'm always nervous about new treats, but she likes these, and it definitely improves her breath.",4
"I have three little dogs. We generally handle feeding them by leaving out some dry food for them all day and then giving them a small meal of meat and rice in the evening. Sometimes they're fairly picky about the dog food that they get and refused to eat certain brands. My general position was that we leave it out until they get hungry enough to eat it, but my wife usually override that and just tossed it. Then we started getting the Beneful a few years ago and we haven't had that issue since.<br /><br />They definitely enjoy the meaty chunks (or whatever the chunks are) very much. As some other reviewer mentioned, the dog will go for that first. Mine will often dump the food out onto the floor and then find the chunks they want and eat those. I could see this being a problem if they only ate the chunks, because that wouldn't be good for their dental health; they're far too soft brush their teeth. Since we don't usually put very much out of the time, the dogs are forced to eat the crunchier bits as well to be full.  They nearly always clean up the mess they made by late afternoon.<br /><br />Our dogs have been eating this stuff for years and have been very healthy. Other than routine shots, only one of them has had to go to the vet for anything else. When they have been in the office, the vet has said that they appeared healthy. I'm not sure how much of that is the food and how much of that is just luck or genetics, but either way this brand seems to work well for us.  I'm not sure if we'll start getting this delivered routinely by Amazon or not, but well likely stick to this brand until they get tired of it.",4
Got this as we are going organic and we love applesauce. We did not like this one as it only had a mild apple flavor. My sons said he had to try real hard to know it was apple.  So giving this 4 stars since flavor is so mild. Also this is not like the commercial applesauces in stoers this is not sweetended with sugar. so do not expect a sweet applesauce.,4
"I've had plenty of fake meats, and i like primal strips, these, like others said, as well as all of their flavors, looked and tasted like a dog treat, they smell awful too, it was extremely disgusting i almost puked.",1
My cat loves these. Good price and convenience with Subscribe & Save - just make sure to check the e-mails for the price changes.,5
"This is a great product that I enjoy daily because I can adjust the fizz as well as the strength of the taste. I have my own formula for preparing this drink to meet my personal desire and I have no problem with the artificial sweetner.  The only problem here is the value.  Amazon sells it for more than Kohl's and Kohl's sells it for more than Bed Bath and Beyond.  I look forward to Amazon having a more competitive price so I can ""load-up"" in the near future (hint-hint).  Either way, I like the diet Lemon-Lime Soda mix better than diet 7up. 'Nuff said?",4
"The word on the street is that Fudd Industries is going into Chapter 11, and that means that rabbit is going to be very hard to find indeed, and it may be some time before a competitor can get into rabbit carcass delivery. God only knows that Acme Industries can't pick up the slack, not with CEO Coyote at the helm. You may have to make do with rabbit substitute for the Christmas Hossenfeffer meal, although from what I hear duck can be used in a pinch.",4
Just bought these again at Kroger- Unbelievably tasty- beats Oreo but is more expensive and actually worth it- plus no high fructose sugar.,3
"I usually drink Twinnings or Bigelow English Breakfast tea in bags, but I'm trying to switch to loose teas and this was my first attempt at English Breakfast.  The dry tea smells like English Breakfast to me, but once it is brewed it smells and tastes totally different, and I don't like the taste at all.  I followed the directions and I have tried different brewing times (2-5min), adding different amounts of milk and/or sugar.  Other people might like it, but be aware that it may not taste anything like what you expect.",1
"These arrived in just 2 days and are so pretty and colorful! Also, they are very soft and fresh and pretty tasty too! My grandkids loved them!  Got these on auto ship....way too good a deal to pass up!",5
"Lickety Stik is an interesting idea. It's a small bottle filled with a thick brown liquid - a liquified dog treat, essentially - which you can squeeze out and smear over the top (sort of like gel deodorant). Your dog, I guess, is then supposed to lick this as a treat, but unfortunately my dog was just confused. I was still able to dab the liquid on his paw, and he seemed to like that quite a bit. So it still works for me to some extent.<br /><br />The big issue, I think, is that I'm not sure what the practical use of this product is. Maybe it's convenient for training; instead of carrying a bag of treats, you can just pop this thing in your pocket. Or I suppose if you have an elderly dog who has trouble with solids, it might come in handy. Otherwise it seems more convenient for me (and probably for many others) to stick with the dry treats.",3
"This item seems like a great idea...a convenient, and non-messy way to carry treats for the dog.  It is like a roll-on deodorant container...a bottle of fluid with a rolling ball top that brings the fluid up to the top of the ball as it is spun.  It has a rich, bacon smell smell to it and my little dog (7 lb. Maltese) was interested in it, but I couldn't get him to lick it beyond the first tentative taste.  I think that it was the novel delivery that threw him off, not the taste.  I believe that with a larger dog, where one tongue swipe would clear off and refresh the ball, it might be better received.<br /><br />I'm back after trying this with a larger dog with no success.  He just wanted to take the whole thing in his mouth.<br /><br />This seems like a good idea and it might work if you started using it with a puppy as a training device.  Perhaps you could ""train"" older dogs to use it properly, but it is certainly NOT worth the effort to do that.",1
I wasn`t sure about this instant type k-cups but it was a pleasant surprise I will be ordering more and my husband enjoyed it also,4
"This repellent needs a hard rain to soak into the ground, not just a sprinkler.  The first couple applications I put down just seemed to freak the moles out, causing them to run into the good yard.  i bought two more bags to make a thick barrier between my good yard and the mole infested areas, but now I have fresh new mole trails deep into the good part of the yard.<br /><br />The directions should say to wait until it rains.  I don't think the sprinkler for 20-30 minutes does the job.  I guess I will just have to use grub killer in the spring and hope my grass fills in over winter.<br /><br />F.",1
"Disclaimer: I have this on subscribe-and-save.<br /><br />I make yogurt with raw milk and this product, when I don't have any yogurt lying around it makes for a very tangy yogurt that is fairly runny. (Milk heated to 110F and incubated at same for 12 hours.)<br /><br />If I ""cook"" the milk to 180F (then cool to 110F before adding this) then it makes for a very firm yogurt that is bland.<br /><br />So, if I had to make a recommendation, it would be to buy this if you're wanting bland yogurt that will be mixed with various fruits. Otherwise just use a dollop of an otherwise edible yogurt as a starter and chance the result.<br /><br />It does contain sucrose so if you're attempting to be paleo/primal you will need to weigh up whether that's acceptable or not.<br /><br />Bland and firm vs runny and tangy. Your choice.",3
"For a product that sells itself behind a liquor brand, I was pretty disappointed that the candies did not contain real liquor. A coworker of mine purchased some malibu chocolates as Christmas gifts for everyone. These candies were great and contained real alcohol but, rather than asking her where she purchased them from (because she more than likely wouldn't have divulged) I decided to look for them myself online.<br /><br />The image shown on Amazon is very vague and (at the time that I purchased) offered no product description. Far be it for me to sound like some kind of alcoholic but, mentioning the non-alcoholic nature of these candies should have been one of the least of things put in the description to help inform a buyer's decision.<br /><br />I understand that it might be tricky selling things of an alcoholic nature online when it may be difficult to verify age, but those chocolates my coworker gave were so tasty that I would've been willing to jump through (some) additional hoops in order to verify mine.",2
"We thought this was the sausage cabellas sold during the holidays, but there was nothing merry about my purchase. It made my wife and oldest son sick to there stomachs and throw up. We had to throw out the rest.",1
"I got the large size for my siberian husky. He sniffed around the treat-filled bottle and turned away. I tried to show him how to get the treats out by pulling the rope, rolling the bottle, etc, he watched me doing it, and still not interested in trying for himself. He didn't even try to bite the bottle. He played with normal water bottles for hours but he just don't think this tug-a-jug is worth any attention. Personally I think it's a great idea how they designed the toy, but I just can't get my dog to play with it. Later I introduced this toy to my coworker, who has a little puggle, and he immediately got one. He puggle chewed up the spiked ball on the bottle neck within 5 minutes...so I guess it's not that durable then.",3
"I purchased these sprinkles to decorate a giant cupcake.  They were just as advertised and I received them promptly.  The colors are soft but vibrant and the size is as one reviewer said, ""a little smaller than a dime."" They just weren't as cute on the cupcake as I had hoped.  I found them to be too large to use as ""sprinkles"" but could definitely see using them in other ways.",2

Since i was not sure if the bread comes like this I did not comment on it. I actually gave half of it away as sort of ""little gifts"" and every body told me the same thing: The bread was brittle and sort of to wet to actually handle it. So know i got thousands of crumbs and try to figure out what to do with them. Very disappointed and would not order again.",1
"smelled nice, color was a very light tan/brown. I did a course grind for a french press and it was very weak and not drinkable in my opinion. I am not sure if I got a bad one, or if it's just not meant for a french press.",2
"These are delicious! I opened the box a little weary, not knowing if these would be good or not, ate one and did not stop eating them until I had made quite a dent in the box. They are so hard to put down! The box says they are creamy and mild and that is a perfect description for these. The cheese flavor is not as strong as the original which can be a nice change.<br /><br />I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe no matter how good any of these cheez-it flavors are, nothing will beat the original.",4
"I am a bit of an energy drink addict.  I got hooked on them when I lived in Japan, where ""genki drinks"" are ubiquitous and sold in little bottles containing a shot of vitamins to get you through the day.  Because of that, I prefer the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029ZAOW8"">5-Hour Energy</a> brand that gives you the energy shot without all the fluff and soda water.<br /><br />I have tried a few of these big can styles, like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IMBHVU"">Monster</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NGP8TY"">Rockstar</a>. They usually taste foul and I find it difficult to finish off a whole can.  But, I am always up something new, so I gave this ""No Fear Super Energy Supplement"" a try.<br /><br /> I was surprised that not only did it not taste bad, it actually tasted good!  This is the first of the big can style energy drinks that I would actually drink for the taste.  It tastes somewhat like a Cherry Cola, with a hint of that vitamin after taste.<br /><br />As far as the energy boost goes, I can't say that I really felt it.  Usually, after I drink a ""5-Hour"" drink I can feel the tiredness wiped away from my eyes and an actual physical effect.  With this ""No Fear"" drink, it was refreshing like any cold drink but I didn't get that sense of waking up.<br /><br />This one can contains two servings, so it is a lot of calories to pack in just to get a small energy boost.  That is one of the things I dislike about the big can energy drinks.  In the future, I will stick with the ""5-Hour"" energy boosters which give you all the goodness and vitamins without the excess of soda water.",3
"While the overall quality of Keebler's line of regular cookies tends to be quite good, their version of 100-calorie shortbread cookies is a true miss.<br /><br />Pros:  You get a large quantity of mini cookies per pouch (in comparison to Pepperidge Farm 100 calorie varieties.)<br /><br />Cons: Any essence of a ""shortbread"" flavor was completely lost to these crisps' just-sweet flavor.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing these in that future.  For those seeking a very decent portion-controlled shortbread-type crisp, I highly recommend either Nabisco's Lorna Doone (sweeter), or Pepperidge Farm Chessmen (very buttery) both in 100 Calorie Pouches.",2
"As others have said, ""if you like your tea to taste like the smell of a campfire"", then this would be the tea for you.  I personally don't like it, but my friend loves it.  He calls it ""smokey tea"" instead of it's real name.<br />It's one of those things that you either will love it or hate it, there's no in between.  If you liked smokey flavored things, you will probably like this tea.  It does taste better with sugar in it too, kind of ""softens"" the taste, but make no mistake...IT'S A STRONG FLAVOR!",4
I love the Kind Almond coconut bars so I decided to try the peanut butter dark chocolate.  It arrived in a box of 12 and all appear fresh.  The bars are both gooey and crunchy.  It is tastey but not as good as the almond coconut.  Very peanutty with a little but of nice dark chocolate.  I like that it is higher protein and that I get to feel like a I had a candy bar but without the crash of eating way too much sugar.  This bar is good but not my favorite,4

After brewing two cups of the coffee, I knew that it is definetely not Pilão Coffee.  I called Amazon and the service lady was very nice and refunded my money.  I do however have a question to Sara Lee for selling something that to me is fraudulent - namely, not what the product claims to be.  If I could give a lower rating thatn one star I would have.",1

This coffee has a bitter aftertaste to it and was very diluted on the 8 oz setting.  Not sure why this got so many good review but tastes like cheap coffee.,3

I'm glad I sampled this before ruining my perfectly good taco, this in no way/shape/form tastes like anything i've had from Taco Bell.",1
Expensive bitter green disks. These just help support the stereotype that things that are good for you must taste bad. Terribly disappointing.,1
I guess you either love it or you don't. I recently read that Cafe Bustelo is a great dark roast coffee for espresso so I gave it a shot. It does not even have the aroma of coffee. To me it smelled and tasted like those stale packages of motel room coffee. It's back to Starbucks Italian Roast for me.,1
I was somewhat disappointed by this purchase. They did not taste fresh. The bags that you purchase in the store are fresher.,2
"I knew my coconut oil had arrived because of the dark, oily spot spreading over the outside of the box. The two containers were bubble wrapped with no other packaging around them so they were rolling around in the box while in transit. I called Nutiva who said that Amazon was the seller and packager of their product. (The guy also said that Amazon has some of the worst packaging of items like this in the industry.) The Nutiva guy said that I got a really good price on their product, but with results like I had, I guess I didn't get a good deal as only one container was sealed and safe to use. I am a huge Amazon fan for many things, but unless I get assurances for packaging improvements, I will hesitate before ordering perishable items in the future.",5

"This product is very expensive but my dogs love them. I can get them to do what ever I want as long as they know they are getting these as a reward but then again, I can also use cheap hot dogs with the same results.

I think the texture is more like lays potato chips than kettle chips. They are alright obviously taste is subjective,2
Don't bother...not worth the money at all.  SO GROSS.  And it isn't just me.  Everyone I have shared it with agrees.  Stick with the plain old cider.  The caramel adds a bizarre flavor.,1
"This coffee is tolerable, but not a true ""highlander grogg"". Another reviewer compared it to Kaldi's in St. Louis, which I think is the best Grogg out there, and I have to say I tried this brand based on that review. Boy was I wrong to do that! This is nothing like Kaldi's, and is at best, an imitation of even a mediocre Grogg.",2
"I really do like my Senseo coffee maker.  I, like others who have reviewed the Kona Pods here, was always searching for a better tasting coffee pod to use in the machine. I was excited to see that Kona now made pods and was also happy to see that they had a pod that was a '2 cup style'.  I have not found it to be a huge deal to use 2 smaller '1 cup' size pods, but it sounded nice to be able to just put one large pod in the machine instead of 2 smaller one.<br /><br />After reading some of the reviews here, I could not figure out what some of the reviewers meant by the Kona pods making different amount of coffee per cup each time or how the coffee could be strange and undrinkable.  It just didn't make sense.  Well, it still doesn't make sense, but it certainly happened with the coffee I made using the Kona pods also.<br /><br />My results were overall poor and it was very disappointing as the Kona pods cost a lot more than Folgers or other pod brands that I can buy locally. The first thing I noticed was that the coffee in the 2 cup sized Kona pods is packed in much more tightly than in any other pod I have ever used in my Senseo.  The instructions for the Kona pods say to wiggle the pods to break up the coffee before inserting into the machine.  The Kona pods feel very hard when taken out of their package.  I always  wiggled and jiggled the pods for about 10 seconds before putting them in the Senseo. After my problems with the Kona pods, my husband decided that I was not 'wiggling' them enough.  He promptly wiggled one to the point that it broke open.  So, there is just so much that can be done to the pod before putting it in the machine.<br /><br />The first thing that I noticed was that the amount of coffee brewed when using the Kona pod was quite a bit less than when using 2 smaller pods.  That did not make much sense, but after several cups of Kona, it was obvious that there was never the amount of coffee coming out as before when using 2 small one cup pods.  The best I can figure out is that the Kona pods themselves seem to 'hold' a lot more water.  There is more water that remains in the pod itself after the brewing is done.  The pod itself is heavier when I take it out to throw it away.  So, I believe the reason that there is less actual coffee using Kona pods is that the pods themselves retain a lot more water and it cannot pass through into the coffee cup.<br /><br />Then, as others have mentioned, there is the problem that happens to me about 1/2 the time when using the Kona pods.  The problem is that for whatever reason, the water does not actually go through and penetrate the Kona pods during the brewing cycle. The 'coffee' that is supposed to be coming out of the spout is just water!  This problem is one that I still cannot really figure out.  The Kona pods are a little smaller in diameter than all the other pods I have tried.  So, I guess that somehow the water has enough room to 'go around' the actual pod and come out of the spout without 'going through' the pod to brew coffee.  I also wonder if the paper filter of the Kona pods is different than other pods and for some reason the Kona paper is more difficult for water to penetrate.  I have tried wetting the Kona pod paper filter right before starting to brew the coffee thinking that perhaps it would help the water to penetrate the paper and pod.  But, that has not worked for me.<br /><br />So, it is back to regular more reasonably priced coffee pods for me.  I have wasted too many expensive Kona pods trying to get a proper cup of coffee from them. Even when the Kona pods brew a cup of coffee, it is not as large of an amount of coffee as I get using other brands.  So, adding the cost of the Kona pods to the fact that it brews a smaller amount of coffee equals a product that is way too expensive when it does actually work.<br /><br />I have been reading of a product called an EcoPod.  It is a refillable pod for these type of coffeemakers.  It might be the next thing I try.",2
"I LOVE THIS BRAND BUT HATE THIS FLAVOR. THE SMELL AND TAST OF IRISH CREAM OVER POWERS THE COFFEE. NOT FOR BREAKFAST NOT VERY SMOOTH EITHER. NOT MY FAVORITE, THE MOCHA JAVA IS GREAT NOT TO MUCH MOCHA JUST A SMOOTH CUP OF COFEE.",2
"Few things I'd like to point out:<p>1.  &quot;Espresso&quot; is not a roast.  It's a drink.  In northern Italy they make espresso from Vienna roast, in southern Italy they use French.  Starbucks appears to be using French roast, so they should just label it French roast like any normal person would.<p>2.  The product description says &quot;Taste Espresso Roast as both a shot of espresso and brewed in a coffee press. This is one versatile coffee!&quot;  This is patently absurd.  It's pre-ground coffee, and it's either for use in espresso machines or presses, but not both.  Here's why:<p>Making a shot of espresso requires a very fine grind.  Making coffee press coffee requires a very course grind.  If you have ground coffee that is appropriate for espresso machines, it will pass through the filter in a coffee press and you will have a cup of sludge.  If you use ground coffee that does not pass through a press's filter in an espresso machine, you do not get espresso.  You get cafe crema, which is a good, but entirely different, beverage.<p>Therefore, a &quot;Universal Grind&quot; is an impossibility.  They should tell you on the label what kind of coffee maker it's ground for, like normal people.<p>3.  It's over-roasted.  Starbucks has an excellent bean-sourcing operation that buys better coffee than any other company of its size.  Then they roast all their beans Vienna or French.  Most beans taste best at a particular level of roasting that varies with the bean, and for most beans that level is not Vienna or French.  So why roast all your beans too dark?  I guess it's just easier that way.  Also, it lets them rename Vienna Roast as &quot;Starbucks Roast&quot; because the Austrians don't seem to care.<p>That said, this is still better than what you get in the supermarket - Starbucks specializes in coffee and sources much better beans than any of the companies that also make cheese, hot dogs, shampoo or cigarettes.<p>Anyway, if you really want some good coffee, do this:<p>Buy a grinder.  Nothing makes coffee lose flavor like keeping it around after grinding.  If you have a drip coffee machine, get a grinder with spinning blades; if you have something else like a press or vacuum pot, get a grinder with burrs.  If you have an espresso machine, get a very nice grinder with burrs.  Amazon has good deals on all three kinds, just do a search for 'coffee grinder'.  It's not that much money, and if you're somebody who's willing to pay for Starbucks you should invest in one.<p>Find a local coffee shop that roasts their own coffee and gives you the date it's roasted on.  Freshness matters!  Good beans don't taste nearly as good after they've been sitting around.<p>Ask the people at your local shop to tell you about the correct amount of beans to use.  Most people don't use the right amount.  If you don't use enough, your coffee comes out bitter, especially if you have a drip machine.  Not enough coffee means the beans you do have get too much exposure to hot water, which makes bitter coffee.",2
This coffee smells amazing when brewed but is so weak that all flavor and aroma is lost if you put anything in it. I was hoping for a little more boldness and wouldn't recommend this to anyone who likes medium or dark roast coffee because they will be sorely disappointed.,2
"I am a a vegetarian, and this is my least favorite ""jerky"".  The texture is sort of slimey and after a couple bites, I had had enough.",2
1st- I must say the customer service was great- however the product itself was poor-- after numerous replacements- I finally purchased new bags elsewhere-- If you do milks--- DON'T BUY THIS BAG-- they don't last and the stuff blows out through the seems.  :(<br />disappointing!!!!,2
Got these for my St. Louis brother-in-law and his whole family just loves this sauce.  Also like the popcorn too.  I can see getting more for him as the holidays approach.,5
These chips are great and so is the price! Other low calorie potato chips are made from a potato batter and usually have added sugar. These are real chips that taste great. Bet you can't eat just one.,5
"I purchased this for two relatives for their birthdays and my family with the thought that it would be a perfect gift for hard to buy people.  I am embarrassed to have paid so much for such a mediocre product. The flavorings were separate from the popcorn and added after it was popped. Flavorings were bland and not identifiable to the taste expected. It's a novel idea, but would I buy it again? NO. In my humble opinion, the packaging was the most impressive part of this popcorn.",2
"I bought this ginger for my wife thinking it was probably made in Australia or in U.S.A. because the only factories listed in Ginger People's web site were in either Australia or California.  Therefore we were quite disappointed when we found out that it was made in China.  We could probably have bought it cheaper in the local Chinese grocery store.  We tried it and it was both very gingery and sugary.  All you could taste was a full month of sugar and it was so HOT.  The ginger also came in small cubes and they should call it candied ginger.  Some were quite tough.  In short, I was not very impressed with this product.  We could probably purchase better products in the local Whole Food.  We were also skeptical with it being Organic since it was made in China where the standard for ""organic' can be substantially different that that of the States.",2
"They say this is ""Micro Brewed""....in other words-instant cooffee in a thin flimsy k-cup.  You would be better off buying a jar of instant and using the hot water out of the Keurig.  I feel this is a deceptive product.  I would give it Zero stars if I could.  Don't waste your money.",1
"This bone has all sorts of dangerous ""knuckles"" that my lab chewed off. Sharp edges. Finally threw all of them out.",1
"Looking forward to the tasty results, but these cannot be used in a hotair popper. We tried them in our our new Presto and they just fell out in to the bowl uncooked. Called Presto; they immediately knew what was wrong - ""Are you using a gourmet corn that is small? There is not enough weight for them to be exposed to the hot air long enough......!"" This is not the seller's fault but be aware you can't pop these in - at least - a Presto hotair popper.",4
"I'm not sure why this taste so different from the Chef Boyardee regular Ravioli, but it taste more bland. It's still a cheap snack to have around though.",3
"Wonderful!! Wonderful!!  Wonderful!!  Elderberry jelly is one of my and my husband's favorite jellies.  When I lived in Ohio, I was able to make it myself.  But there are no Elderberries growing in Arizona so I was extremely happy to find some before my husband passed away.  Mrs. Miller's tastes just like I had picked the berries and made the jelly myself.  Thankyou soooo much!",5
"I purchased this product because I loved the fruit & yogurt version (which I will no longer purchase because it has partially hydrogenated oils).  All I can say is this cereal is gross!!  The chocolate is disgusting and after one bite I decided to throw the entire box away.  It also has partially hydrogenated oils, which means trans fatty acids.  Unfortunately, I just began reading the ingredients lists of my foods, or I never would have purchased this in the first place.  Buy something healthier, such as Nature's Path, and add a small amount of organic or vegan chocolate if you need a chocolate fix.",1
"I use this not for the chocolate, which is delicious, but more for the title. I attach to documents I want someone to notice with a note that reads ""here are the riesens (reasons) to read the attached xyz....""  It really grabs someone's attention.",5
"Strong, little bitter, but don't have a rich coffee flavor. You can find the same flavor on supermarket less value, Pilon, Bustelo, etc.",3
"I really like these chips. We go through a lot of corn chips in this house and it is important to me that our corn chips are organic as I refuse to eat GMO corn. They have a great flavor and the perfect amount of salt. My only complaint is that this last case we recieved, the chips are so fragile! They are breaking really easily, they are not holding up to any amount of dipping, which is a bummer. I'll still buy these chips, I'm just not as pleased with them as I have been in the past. Perhaps it was just an odd batch, as they haven't always been this way.<br /><br />We have bought several flavors of Garden of Eatin chips and this brand is a winner, overall. Definitely our favorite corn chip brand!",4
"Being a salt-free product is why I purchased this, but the chips are quite greasy.",2
"Average is not bad, is just not great. Over the years I have tried many Stir Fry Sauces and this one is just one more on a long line of choices. More like a 3.5 but, so sory, not 4. They do come in handy one time or another when a little variety is needed to liven up fish, chicken, shrimp, et.",3
"This is a nice every day conditioner, no overpowering scents<br /><br />Works pretty well, yet if you have dry hair, you'll probably want either a conditioner with more oils in it, or will want to add a hair treatment to it.<br /><br />OK conditioner with no overpowering smells, like many conditioners & shampoos have, but lacks as a conditioner for those with very dry hair.",3
"This tea tastes great. It is a quality product. I used it for one month, but it did not work for me. My blood pressure was still high. I drank it 2 or 3 cups per day.",2
"My dog really enjoys these and they do not last long. She is not a big chewer, and doesn't like bones, so I wanted to get something that she could much on from time to time so to help clean her teeth. I was attracted to these because they are low calorie and made in the US. When you get them out of the package they don't look like food, but the dogs don't really mind. They are flexible enough to cut in half with kitchen shears if you have a small dog.",5
"I've had these at Starbucks, and saw on myList that you can buy them here! Really delicious and filling, and not dry like other granola or health bars.",4
I was pleasantly surprised when I brought home and used Wanchai Ferry a box. I just bought it because it caught my eye. I enjoy cooking Chinese style food and this product comes with everything you need but the chicken or pork. I find it works best with the chicken. It comes in a variety of tasty flavors.,4
"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1
"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are Fish, water sufficient for processing, and meat by-products. At least the first ingredient is 'fish' and not a by-product or cheap filler, but I find it odd that its not ""salmon"" or ""tuna"" just ""fish"". If they were using quality fish, they wouldn't have to hide behind an ambiguous label. Also, the rest of the ingredients are disgusting! There are many by-products in this food. By-products are not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, bones, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that put off an appetizing aroma, and taste good to cats. Also, I usually feed my cats dry food for dental and digestion reasons, so I think they were excited just to have a wet food ""treat."" I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a marketing company with no regard for the feline diet; thus producing very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats are carnivores and need to eat meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods, such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat- with no added fillers or low quality arbitrary ""meats"".",1
"Bought the nacho chips regularly for my kids but the last delivery came and there was not a non-GMO label on the package anymore, they still use organic corn but use non organic canola oil and any non organic canola is most likely Genetically Modified, which is something I do not want in my body.  Will not buy this product again.",1

Would be hard not to be.",2
"nothing comes realatively cheap these days and still get the satisfaction.  I love stash tea, as it presents both good value (via amazon) and offers a little luxury amongst its peers.  There are more expensive brands, but as a brand, this one cuts about the rest.  I love the chamomile version and it is a sure winner in the taste section too. Highly recommend and thanks amazon for making it so affordable.",4
"Pros: I have tried poison sprays to get rid of fungus gnats in my houseplants. So far I think I poisoned our home and killed more plants than any gnat. These little sticky traps are the only thing I have found that will alleviate the problem by 50 to 75%. They are not gone, it does help that it is freezing here right now. Gnats can't live below 65F, so between the cold and traps I have slowed them down considerably.<br /><br />Cons: They are a bit pricey @7USD with only 7 per pack. This time I bought 4 packs. It would be nice if they offered a larger package at a bulk price.",4
"I am a K9 police officer for a fairly large police department.  One of our local pet stores recently started selling Orijens dog food and told us of its high quality.  It was supposed to be ideal for large active dogs.  Six officers transitioned their K9s to this food.  Five of those six officers have had to take their dogs off of it.  Two dogs nearly died from gastric and liver problems.  These two had to spend days overnight at the vet, one required extensive surgery to save him.  The other three also had gastric problems, but did not require medical attention before they were taken off the food.  All of the dogs experienced problems within a month, or even just a few days after transition to Orijens food.  Only one of the six dogs not experience a problem.  Use caution with this food and monitor your dogs for signs of bloat.  We will never recommend this product.",1

"When I had heard enough about dogs getting sick or dying after eating Chinese chicken jerky, I went looking for products made in the US and found this and have ordered several 1 lb bags. When fewer and fewer vendors were listed on amazon and the price quadrupled from my last purchase, I called the manufacturer to see if they had stopped making the product. The person said no, they had reformulated it so I waited for that to show up. Now it has so I went back to the manufacturer's web site to see what they changed.<br /><br />I was appalled by what I found. From my bags of the old product here is a list of the ingredients. Chicken, natural smoke flavor. That's all.<br /><br />Here's the reformulated product ingredient list: Chicken, betaine, brown sugar, cultured dextrose, sea salt, natural smoke flavor, garlic powder, mixed tocopherols (preservative), paprika extract color, rosemary extract.<br /><br />I didn't know what betaine was so I looked it up on the net. After reading about it, I still don't know what it is.<br /><br />The crude protein dropped from 77% to 50%.<br />crude fat increased from 2% to 5%.<br />moisture increased from 18% to 28%.<br /><br />I am not going to give this product to my dog and will make my own chicken jerky in the oven.<br />____________________<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I just went to a new Petco that opened near me. I found a 1 lb package of Colorado Naturals Chicken Jerky Dog Treats. Made in the US.<br /><br />Ingredients: Chicken breasts, natural flavorings.<br /><br />Crude protein 70%<br />Crude fat 3-7%<br />Moisture 10%<br /><br />I will be buying these when I run out of my old stock of True Chews.",1
Probably my second favorite coconut milk. Good flavor. Just started using a different coconut milk that I like better. Will still use this coconut milk in the future.,4
"Well, reviews for this drink are all over the place, so I can't say my review is definitive. Anyway, this drink met with negative results, here - too sweet and rich, but, it would be best to judge for yourself or look at several reviews. For me, not being a regular coffee drinker, I prefer a cold Coca Cola or iced tea, rather than any iced coffee drink anytime. Plus, at about $2 for a can, too expensive for me - but I'm a cheapskate, so keep that in mind.",2

I've had both the grapefruit and orange and recommend them for what they are ... a tasty and good alternative to soda.",4
"I have never before given a negative review to anything, but I am very sorry that I bought a full 12 pack of this.  I had previously used another brand and found it to be wonderful. I made the mistake of assuming that this product would be of equal quality.  Pacific Natural has a very thick consistency and exudes a strong chalky taste. Can't return the unopened 11 containers and will not drink them. I will buy living harvest brand in the future even though it costs more.",1
"Yeah, these are definitely not what I was expecting with jerky.  Hard , flat circles of some sort of flavored processed meat.  I read the reviews and thought I really loved peppered jerky so I know I will like them.  Then I got them and they are pretty tough about like putting a piece of thick plastic in your mouth.  You chew on it for a while and it loosens up and the peppered does have some flavor, but they get old pretty fast.  By about the 3rd day I was going to the store to get some real jerky.  I do not like to be wasteful but these are pretty bad.  I give it three stars as you do get a lot for the price and there is some flavor if you are willing to suffer through the hard blandness until you soften it up.  I would never order these again.",3

"I have been ordering the three pack of regular Breakfast Blend for some time now, but Amazon sent the MEDIUM Breakfast Blend on my last order.  I tried to make sure I ordered the right one, and did, but they sent the MEDIUM anyway.  Quick tip:  the MEDIUM blend is absolutely awful.  Don't waste your money on this one if you're a regular Breakfast Blend lover.  The real/original Breakfast Blend is smooth and mellow with no bitterness and great taste.  This MEDIUM takes more like the institutional Maxwell House.  I won't be ordering this again.",2
"I love spicy sauces, knowing that I knew that taco bell and spicy arent words you put together. I still got this anyway. I love condiments, its a known fact, and if there is something new to try I will probably dip something into it. I used to be forced into Taco Bell food back in the darker days, and actually enjoyed the Baja Gordito with the orangish sauce..i suppose that was the Chipotle. It was the only redeeming tidbit to those visits.<br /><br />This sauce, is just plain nasty. It doesnt taste like jalapenos or sauce or tacos or bells, it tastes like a creamy plastic tangy mess. I suppose if you are drunk enough at 3 am and weave through the drive thru this stuff all over a soft taco would be heavenly, unfortunately I tasted it stone cold sober in my kitchen and I actually uttered the word ""BLECH"" ...I bleched and that is a bad sign.<br /><br />This is one bottle of sauce I will not dip into.",1

"This is the worst coffee I have ever bought. It stinks really bad. The beans are very oily which is bad for the grinder (I have a super automatic). The taste is bitter and dark and strong...not smooth and rich like the Lavazza I usually get.

Never again!<br /><br />2 weeks later....I want to add that I sent the coffee beans back to Amazon and they refunded my money! Thank you Amazon...once again you have proven to be a great company!",1

The bananas, black beans and rice work well together, both in taste and texture, and I know this is one meal my baby will gobble down every time.

"I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research.

"I purchased a  bag of these per reccomendation of a friend of mine, I opened the bag, and yes it smelled, I put the noodles in boiling water for 3 minutes and when I drained them the smell was pretty much gone. I mixed them with a cream cheese/sour cream sauce recipe on the back of the package. The texture was disgusting, I could only swallow a few bites before I spit it out. It was rubbery and almost impossible to chew. I don't understand how reviewers could say that I must have cooked it wrong, I followed the directions.",1
"What's in this stuff?  Where's the list of ingredients?<br /><br />I don't eat anything unless I know and approve of what's in it.<br /><br />For example, although this product's description says it contains no sugar, it does not say if it contains any artificial sweeteners, which are also bad for you.<br /><br />For one thing, aside from tasting awful, artificial sweeteners often cause horrendous intestinal cramps and diarrhea.<br /><br />In addition to having long ago given up the eating of sugar and sugar in all its guises (e.g: ""natural"" cane juice, fruit juices, ""raw"" sugar, ""organic"" sugar, etc.), I also stopped ingesting artificial sweeteners of any kind.<br /><br />So, what's in this stuff?",1
"I got this product as part of a six-flavor package.  It turned out to be the only Sahale product that I have tried that is bad.  Worse than bad.  Terrible.  Disgusting.  How did this stuff get past the corpoate taste tests?  It is even worse than Emerald brand dry roasted almonds, which are awful because of the garlic and onion added.  I love plain salted roasted almonds, and thought Sahale could find a way to make them even better tasting.  Not this time.",1
"I have a labrador retriever. He weighs 82 lbs. He loved the bone, but I made the mistake and allowed him to eat the bone in one sitting. It was too much of a shock to his digestive system.  The next morning he developed diarrhea. I' m not sure if the bone is the reason the diarrhea lasted so long, but to be causious I will not buy the bones again.  To be fare about the product, I bought three of the bones and the last one was the one associated with my dog's problem, but of course that last bone is the only one he eat in one sitting.  I believe the product would be best for larger dog's than mine, or for smaller dog if the owner regulator the amount of the bone that is eaten at each sitting .",4
"While this was supposed to be a light roast, I found it extremely strong and bitter tasting. Buyer beware: If you like light roast coffees as I do, this isn't one of them even though it's labelled that way! I won't buy it again!",2
"My 13+ dog has lost her taste for most foods, and lost an alarming amount of weight.  I went through brand after brand of highly rated, expensive foods and each time, my dog took a sniff and walked away.<br /><br />I had my doubts about this dog food, but I bought a can of the adult formula at my local store, and my dog ate the whole thing.  So I ordered a case of the senior formula, and she has been enjoying it ever since!<br /><br />What a relief, thank goodness that I discovered this food!",5
"We fostered a dog and bought him a bunch of toys to keep him entertained while we were at work all day.  Some of the toys he loved, but this one scared him.  The plastic is think and hard, so when he would roll it from side to side it made a loud noise from the impact on our hard floors.<br /><br />I think it would work better with carpeted homes.  Also, it can be pretty tricky for dogs to get the treats out, so I would say this is an 'advanced' toy.",2
"This is like a good flavored pig rinds but better, I love them and have reordered already.",4
"For $7.50 a bar I expected something really good, but these chocolates were marginal at best. Out of the 6 people who tried it, not one liked the taste or combo. We couldn't even give it to the dog to finish (chocolate is toxic to canines). Disappointing for sure and now I'm scared to try any more products from this company because of the high prices. Too bad, they have what seems like interesting chocolate combos. To be fair, maybe it's an aquired taste?",1
"Well, we all know this one is not a healthy thing to eat, but we love it cause it is easy and tastes good. My sons like top ramen as their favorite, but this one, according to them, tastes the same, but has more noodles. I personally think this is even saltier.Not sure if it is good enough for the price though.",3
"When I lived in Greece in the Seventies, I insisted on drinking what the old people drank, namely Turkish coffee (""emeis to leme elleniko"" - ""we call it Greek"" said a blurb on the package). However, Greek youth frequently spurned such stuff and drank instead the ""frappes"" made from the product you see here. To each their own. However, I've found a different use for it these latter days: I carry it on camping, and, especially, backpacking trips. Since it doesn't need, really, to be heated, there's no messing about with stoves and cleaning. How does it taste? Well, you can't have everything. But if you're addicted to coffee, and heat is unavailable or inconvenient, here's a product that might serve your purpose. Or perhaps prove that you're not the old-fashioned sort of Greek.",3
"So far, I've loved all of the coconut water brands and flavors I've tried, including Zico. However, this was the first one I tried in a plastic bottle and was disappointed to find that there is a little bit of a plastic flavor to it. Zico's great, but I'm definitely going to stick to the box from now and on.",3
"Best croutons around, but this price is ridiculous. You can buy these at Walmart for $1 a bag. I buy 6 bags at a time whenever I'm in the store.",3
"We use a fair amount of Crystal Ligh in the summer months. When mixed as directed its a bit too sweet for my personal preference but adding a little extra water solves that problem and also gets you a little more drink for your money.<br /><br />The flavor is pleasant and refreshing, which is what one generally wants from a beverage such as this.",4
"So we got this toy for our dog who gets bored easily, but loves treats. Unfortunately we left this ""everlasting"" treat ball with him for 15 minutes unsupervised and he managed to crack the large treat disc and gobbled it all up. We use the rubber toy now to fill it with kibble, a milkbone or jerky when we leave him in the apt by himself. It keeps him occupied for maybe 5-10 minutes because he knows he has to bite down in the center to crunch up the treats. It makes a huge mess so be warned. However, the pro to this toy is that it withstands his powerful chewing.",2
"The salmon and potatoes was not what I ordered. My dog was using salmon and rice from Simple and I went to Amazon, to my last order and reorder the product.  What I received was the Salmon and potatoes.  Since I was out of his food I did give him the new product and now he his having allergy problems again.  I am dissapointed and will need to find a new food for him. He loves the taste but I would have though I would be notified that this was not the product on my products page.",2
"I've been using Erythritol for a little over a year now.  The added bonus to this particular brand is that they assure it's non-GMO!  I had been using Truvia, which is extremely expensive, especially if trying to bake with it!  I found a recipe for how to make my own Truvia with Erytritol and Stevia.  SO easy to make at a fraction of the cost of Truvia, and again, I know all my sweetner is non-GMO too.<br /><br />Not sure if everyone knows though that Erythritol does not melt like sugar.  In order to make it work in recipes, you really need to ""powder"" it if using in recipes.  Just put it in your coffee mill, Ninja, Vitamix....something that has a high processing speed and just blend it until it's powdered.  DO NOT open the lid until it's all settled though.  Otherwise, your kitchen will be coated in sweet white powder!!  Anyway, am posting the blend to make your own Truvia and the conversions for sugar to the homemade granular Truvia and also the powdered Truvia conversions.  Hope this helps some of you bakers out there.  It sure has been great for my own cooking/baking!<br /><br />Homemade ""Truvia"" Sweetener<br /><br />Makes 1/4 cup sweetener substitute<br /><br />1/8 teaspoon good tasting stevia extract (I use NuNaturals pure white stevia extract)<br />1/4 cup erythritol<br /><br />Add ingredients to plastic baggie. Shake baggie well to mix sweeteners.<br /><br />**To replace 1 cup of Truvia, mix 1/2 teaspoon of pure stevia extract with 1 cup erythritol. Enjoy!<br /><br />TRUVIA CONVERSION (spoonable)<br /><br />2 teaspoons sugar = 3/4 teaspoon Truvia (1 1/4 teaspoons powdered Truvia)<br />1/4 cup sugar = 1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons Truvia (2 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 teaspoons Powdered Truvia)<br />1/2 cup sugar = 3 tablespoons Truvia (1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon powdered Truvia)<br />1 cup sugar = 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons Truvia 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons powdered Truvia)",5
"After finally trying this Kona I'm a believer. It's the Best!!! This is a 1st class Peaberry Kona in every way. Don't be fooled by others of lower quality, Blue Horse is the real thing. Fresh, unsurpassed quality, great price, supper fast shipping and great company philosophy. Give Blue Horse Peaberry Kona a try, it really is one of the best Kona out, in my opinion. Thanks guys, A",5
"Was hoping that the pieces would be a bit flatter in structure, but they shy away from sausage stick territory fine enough.  Flavor wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about.  I'm just glad they weren't that greasy.",3
"my english bulldog, popeye loves these little  melt in your mouth button cookies made from all natural products! he hasn't learned to  sow down and chew his treats properly so this is a perfect substitute for jerky products that continually choke him.. if he happens to not chew them, he hasn't gotten choked on these yet.these honey ones  are  round and dime-sized versus the other teddy bear shaped  3 times larger than our teddy graham cookies) grandma lucy's oven baked treats. i'll continue to buy them for him as long as he loves them!",4
"I loved this product as a teenager and hadn't seen it for years until it showed up on the shelf at my local grocery. The quality of the product I bought at the store was great and I love this product not only for taste and versatility but it is low cal. However, I was disappointed in the product I received via Amazon. It seemed that the toast was very brittle and if I had to guess I bet it was because maybe it was past its prime shelf life. I will still continue to order groceries from Amazon because for the most part I have been satisfied.",1
"I ordered Cafix because a search for my old standby Postum was not being made anymore.  It is a grain hot beverage, non cafeinated, good with milk and sugar and even the kids can drink it.  This product is totally a good substitute for Postum, which I laughed at my Grandma for drinking...her ""ole lady"" coffee.  Now I'm the ""old lady!""",4
"The duck sticks were old, greasy and had a rank smell.  The container had a US flag sticker on the lid.  My dog really likes the Tinker duck treats, but I wouldn't give her these.  I hope Amazon finds a different supplier.",1
"I am addicted to this stuff! It's excellent by itself, but even better on a salad with a balsamic vinaigrette and some bleu cheese. Can't be beat!",5
"Our 14 lb Mini Schnauzer easily started splintering this bone in a matter of minutes and being an 'ever hungry' dog he just swallowed these pieces. Seeing this I took the bone away after he ate about a third of it. Less than 24 hrs later when it was time for his breakfast at 7:30 AM (his standard time) he refused to eat! This was the first time he ever refused to break his overnight fast!! But after a few minutes the hunger must have gotten the better of him; he gave in and ate almost all of it (usually he cleans up his little bowl) and about an hour later he threw up all of it in FOUR rounds of puking!<br /><br />I could see small, softened yet still relatively firm pieces of this Healthy Edible ""bone"" in his vomit. What a shame I went for this thinking it would be a great alternative to feeding my dog indigestible nylon.",1
"Here's how I use it, and why it's great. We have a composting toilet, and I need to empty those contents into a bag in order to put it into a bigger composting system. For me, the rather high cost (including double bagging) is negligible for our purposes. We don't use these up like normal refuse liners, rather they are specific for the compost process. Don't buy these expecting for them to be a cost effective (yet green) swap out for your normal trash bags. They are more expensive and they are not as strong. But if you have a lot of organic material and you want to keep everything moving smoothly, give these a shot.",4
"Once again I gave Velveeta a try and came away unimpressed.  I was hopeful that the combination of chicken and broccoli would be enough to jazz up a mundane meal.  I was wrong.  The meal was simply average, nothing out of the ordinary, no distinctive tastes or seasonings.  The use of velveeta does create a smoother texture than other similar box meals but other than that there is nothing remarkable about it.  If you are a fan of Velveeta, loyal to the brand etc. then this would be the selection for you. Othewise I must say that it is the same as compared to any other chicken boxed meal that I have had.  Overall it was an average meal.",2
"I recently discovered LARABAR and am in full addiction mode.  I love most of the flavors.  Chocolate is one of my favorites.  I wish they had more mixed boxes as 16 of the same flavor will wear me down.  If you get a chance, try to Cashew flavor and the Chocolate Coconut Chew -- they're delicious.  So far the only flavor I'm not a fan of is the banana -- the consistency was weird.",5
"I thought I was getting something special for my babies. It was marked down and I thought I was getting a steal. But I had second thoughts as soon as I opened the can. It looks like something you would spackle a wall with. Seriously, it has the consistency of paste. Thankfully, I have one cat that is my little garbage can and I know when he's really hungry that I can get rid of one of these Newman's Own Organic Beef cat food cans.",2
"Was expecting more with the high price but my dog barely touched this, and when he did eat it he would have food allergies",2
Better than many I have tried.  With a little honey this is a terrific cup of tea.  Going to order more.  Nice and smooth.,5
"Some of the best and most variety of specialty and Italian food products available.  However, shipping is haphazard and unreliable.  Their packages look as if they have been drug behind the truck delivering them.  They promise to replace damaged or broken items, but the replacement never materializes.  The product is good though, if usable when you receive it.",4
"The lemon juice packets that arrived are not the same as pictured. They are from a different (inferior?) manufacturer. Note that the item title does not say ReaLemon, even though the product specification does. Also, several of the packets leaked during shipping, creating a sticky mess. I would not buy this item again in the future.",2
"I admit to being really picky when it comes to maple syrup, some lack flavor, or are really bitter in aftertaste etc.....this stuff is heavenly and I will reorder it as long as they carry it.  Worth every penny.",5
every thing was fine good product and i received it in a very timely manner keep up the good work,3
This brand of fenugreek does not work.  If I could send back the open bottle I would have.  I will stick with the GNC brand because natures way made my milk supply go down drastically.  After taking the GNC brand my milk supply went up.,2
"Chief is without a doubt our favorite curry powder and I was pleased to see it offered on Amazon (although it is often out of stock).  The only negative is the price but since I don't have anywhere to get it other than Trinidad, I guess it is reasonable if one considers the airfare for a round trip ticket to Trinidad.<br /><br />This curry is not spicy-hot although you can certainly add some heat to it if you desire.  Curry is a blend of spices, so curries can vary.  Chief curry powder contains Coriander, cumin, garlic, tumeric, fenugreek, ani, and ajwa.  It is a yellowish-green color when it is cooked with chicken or shrimp and onions.<br /><br />Using this curry powder all you need to do to make curried chicken is lightly sear some chicken pieces in oil, add as much onion as you like, make a paste out of the curry powder (about 4 T depending on your taste) using the liquid in the pan, then cover it all with some chicken broth and cook until the meat falls apart. Serve over rice.",4
"I bought one of these and used for feeding with my 6 month old.  I thought it would be very convenient, especially on the go.  However, I found that the spoon is too deep for my baby.  She can't get all food into her mouth so there's always some left on the spoon.  And since the hole is at the bottom of the spoon, you need to squeeze a lot out in order to fill the spoon up.  It might work better when she's older and can take bigger bites.",2
"I love this coffee made in my french press.  It is smooth, full of vanilla goodness and the rich coffee taste that I've come to expect from Starbucks.  I did try it in a regular coffee pot over the holidays and all the guests loved it, but I really recommend a coffe press/french press for the perfect starbucks flavor!  Delicous.",4
"I was not impressed about this product (Made in China). Cheaply made and not very good quality. Outside was coated with redish brown sweet something which stained the carpet.  My dog first tried to lick the coating and then bit the ""bone"".  It was like hard leather, more than bone, and left a mess of shreds about as well.",2
"If you like unsweetened green tea, you'll like this.  Taste great chilled, gives me a little boost of energy and it's supposedly good fer ya.  Cute little can size too.",4
"These are decent sun dried tomatoes, but they are NOT what is described. They are dried tomatoes in a pouch. There is no olive oil and there is no jar. This is not what I ordered. Both the photograph and the item description are incorrect. Amazon was nice enough about refunding my money, once I found a way to contact them by phone.",2
"I drink several cups of tea a day. I like Earl Gray but the Bigalow doesn't have the intensity and spunk I expect from tea. Leaving it steep longer makes it nasty and bitter, of course. I won't order it again. It isn't bad, it just isn't my cup of tea.",3
"So I didn't know what to expect when trying this product...  I suppose I thought I'd detect a slightly off or metallic taste, with all the electrolytes added, but I did not.<br /><br />Though the product advertises itself as ""silky smooth"" I don't think I'd describe it that way.  It tasted fine, but not ""better"" than water, and not any worse.<br /><br />If you really are struggling to find water that has some of these characteristics, then I'd give it a try.  Me, I'm going to stick with filtered water, because I really couldn't tell the difference.",4
"I've been using this for multiple purposes - for hair and skin care, and for cooking. Makes my hair really soft and soaks in nicely, and even though I have never had particularly rough skin, I am noticing a difference with softness. For cooking, I don't know exactly how well it's working - it's supposed to boost metabolism and promote energy, but I've only been taking it for a week so I haven't really noticed. But one thing's for sure, it's a lot healthier than cooking with butter...",5
"Zuma my Hairless Chinese Crested pup is a very finicky eater and would rather starve then eat something he doesn't like. The only food he will eat is Cesar Gourmet Filets in sauce...... OK  now to find a dog treat he likes. My husband brought home ""Cesar Grilled Chicken softies dog treats"" and he LOVES them. The treats do look and smell like a dog treat and I thought there was no way Zuma would eat them.  So hundreds of dollars spent at numerous bog bakeries  and a year and a half spent shopping all all over the place, we found Cesar grilled chicken softies dog treats. We are not only thrilled, but relieved.",5
This is the familly favorite flavor for the gummi candies.  The only problem we have found is 'out of stock.',5
"I tried this on my mom's dog while he went through his resume of tricks, but since his mouth is bigger than the Lickety Stik he kept trying to bite it.  He got annoyed after a few tricks when he realized I wasn't going to give it to him and wandered off to find my mom who was holding actual treats.",3
My female bulldog has skin allergies and this product really helps her condition.  This is a good price for it with free shipping.,4
The actual package received is not at all as shown in the product picture.  This seriously reduces the value.<br /><br />Beware the other Black Friday or Cyber Monday savings from this company.<br /><br />Shame on Amazon for kicking off the holiday season with this bait and switch.<br /><br />I'm happy with Amazon 95% of the time.  They missed on this one.<br /><br />Postscript:  Amazon refunded a large enough portion of the purchase price to satisfy me.  Kudos for their honorable response.,2
"My dog loves them just fine, but they don't seem to be doing anything from what I can see. I don't think i'd buy these again. nothing special.they work great as regular treats though!",3
"Maybe I am the only one, but I give my dogs pig ears to keep them occupied for a while. It takes both of them a good 5-10 minutes to eat one. But I know they aren't the healthiest thing on the planet, so when these better than ears came out, of course I tried them. Both of my dogs love them, but they can eat one in about 30 seconds, defeating the purpose of a chew type treat. For the price, I'd rather just buy them regular dog biscuits that are eaten in the same amount of time. That being said, the Amazon price is MUCH cheaper than any in store local price I've seen. Maybe these are better for small dogs that can't devour them so quickly, but my 70 pounders eat them like they are a regular old dog biscuit.",3
"I really love herbal tea, especially orange and mandarin. But all of Teekanne's teas were tasteless and even if you put two packages in a cup of tea you still get no taste. Now I have three packages of Teakanne (2 relaxing and 1 energizing) and I don't know what to do with it. Surely will not drink it.",1
Timothy's Italian Roast is a very good medium roast coffee.  I found little bitterness or aftertaste with it.  A nice smooth cup of coffee.  So many choices in the k-cup world. There's something for everyone. I would give it 5 stars but the name says Italian Blend.  I would figure an Italian coffee would have a darker roast.,4
"Did not like safflower oil in this soup. I wish they would make soups with Olive or no added oil and sugar.<br />Imagine foods adds cheaper mix of canola/safflower, I hope they stop that.",2
"Although packaging was perfectly intact, three of the four cans received were badly dented. This gives me the impression that the seller is intentionally selling dented cans of the product. I would buy this product again but only from a store where undamaged merchandise can be visually inspected before purchase. Selling damaged merchandise is not good customer service.",2
Great tasting product with very good mixability that leaves me satisfied till the next meal. Just not enough calories per serving with the powder alone.,4
"I ordered the 10 oz crab cakes.  Usually you expect a shell or so, but not in EVERY bite.  The 'lump' was not all lump meat either.  These were a great disappointment. The flavor is fine, but I would never order these again.  I have found G&M crab cakes to be true lump and much better than these.",1
I just love these cookies! I'm amazed at the taste.  You don't need to be gluten free to love them.,5
"I've tried quite a few energy drinks, mints and pills and have favorites in each area.  5-Hour Energy isn't my personal favorite as far as energy drinks go, but it is quite exceptional.  When I tried 5-Hour Energy, the first thing that I noticed was that I noticed nothing at all.  I gradually became more alert and less tired, but not once did I experience the jitters, a fast heart rate or any of the other side effects some claim to have experienced here.  What I did feel was what I feel like after having had a restful night's sleep.  I wasn't going to run a marathon at full speed, but I wasn't going to zone out for the rest of the day either.  I remained awake and alert for roughly seven hours, so the five hour claim might just be an estimate.  Either way, when it was time for bed, I had no problem going to sleep and absolutely ZERO crash effects.<br /><br />The only negative aspect of this drink is the taste.  It's somewhat medicinal, but pretty much all energy drinks have a medicinal taste in my opinion.<br /><br />If you want something to ""take it up a notch"" while working out or doing hard physical labor, 5-Hour Energy might not be for you.  However, if you want a few steady, alert hours minus the jitters, 5-Hour Energy is the perfect choice.",4
"When in Jamaica I drink JBM coffee and have come to develope a fine appreciation for the bean. What I opened this morning was not what I had expected. To be clear, I was greatly dissapointed. I found bits of husk from the bean, which doesn't make coffee, and is considered filler. The flavor left something to be desired as well, it tasted like folgers coffee without all the acid. I was hoping to leave a great review of this product, but honesty forbids it.",2
This took over a week to receive so if you have an ill cat choose another source. This one is too slow.,1
"i bought these in bulk for a animal rescue donation drive to add to my care package but am returning them IMMEDIATELY after i saw they are produced in China. i didn't realize it at the time or i would have never bought them.  I don't mean to discriminate but I am still very leery of buying any pet products made in China given their extremely poor (and dangerous!) quality control. I bought all three flavors and the chicken flavor in particular gives me pause as its a bright, almost neon, yellow. There are going back asap.",1
"I have been waiting. This usually arrives on time and is a godsend, because when my cat runs out --oh, it's awful!! Guess I have to run to the store.",1
"I Ordered ""German Johnson"" tomato seeds. I got just what I ordered, looked like about 80 seeds, and four weeks ago I planted them into a prepared bed (Oct.16th ... living in southernmost Texas, my ""summer"" is in the winter). The price seemed a little high ($1.29), but when I realized it included S&H as well, I was happy enough. Many companies were charging more.<br />Seeds sprouted up in a week, and now 1 month after planting I count 124 plants (not bad out of ""80 seeds""), mostly 4-6"" tall, and ready to transplant into rows!<br />I raise vegetables organically on a small truck-garden for the Farmer Markets in my area. In a few months I'll let you know what my customers & I thought of the tomatoes themselves. Thank you, Seed Needs... sincerely.",4
"The first of these I had was wonderful.  I got renewed energy and it helped me get through the rest of the day.  I've drank most of the rest of these and generally it gives me a bit of energy and does help me get through the day, but not like that first time.  There is one other time I did get the same blast as the first time.  Maybe it has to do with how much I've eaten before drinking this?<br /><br />The best thing about this, though, is there's no drugged feeling.  And I sleep well the night after I take this.  All-in-all, it's been a good boost for me, though.  I'd definitely recommend it to someone like me who gets very tired in the afternoons and needs a boost of energy.<br /><br />I do like the berry flavor of the caffeinated version better than the citrus flavor this comes in.  But I haven't found the decaf version in anything other than citrus flavor.",3
"*** 1/2 stars rating for &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;. This movie was one of the biggest surprises in 1988, it revolutionized the visual effects field, established Tim Burton as a director with a huge imagination, put Winona Ryder on the map, and helped Burton & Michael Keaton to be signed by Warner Bros. to film their strongest 1989 project: &quot;Batman&quot;.<br /><br /> &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; is a very funny ghosts tale with a lot of creativity and imagination, the characters are easy to love, the situations are funny and bizarre at the same time, all this translates into a very entertaining movie.<br /><br /> There are several memorable scenes in &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, among them a possession scene at the tune of Harry Belafonte's &quot;Banana Boat Song&quot;, another is the one on which Adam & Barbara (Alec Baldwin & Geena Davis respectively) are taken to the underworld offices.<br /><br /> &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; is a good option to see the gorgeous Winona Ryder in one of her key roles, to see the creativity of Tim Burton at his best, and to see a very funny supernatural comedy.",3
"I was dissapointed this potato chips, tast ok, not very crunchy and all broked tiny pieces.",2
"I knew when I ordered these that I was making a mistake, because ""large"" olives are always the worst.  But I took a chance.<br /><br />These lack flavor, I mean there isn't really even a hint of flavor in them.<br /><br />Further, the texture is unappealing; it's not quite mushy, and not quite mealy, but something between those two.<br /><br />I would not recommend them considering that there are so many wonderful olives available instead.",2
"First, I will say that I have bought plenty of good coffee from Coffee Bean Direct.<br /><br />That said, this is terrible coffee (for Kona or otherwise).  I have had many different variants of Kona, ranging from pure to similarly labeled blends - none of which were so bad.  This is dry, bitter and bland - probably the worst of all worlds.<br /><br />To put things into perspective, Costa Rican from the same vendor is an infinitely superior coffee that I have as a subscription mainstay for my house.<br /><br />Again, I like this vendor, but despise this particular coffee.  Don't waste your money . . . After Eight from your local grocer would be 100 times better.",1
i bought this product because of a recommendation and the reviews from amazon. It helps me regulate my weight but has not noticeably helped with my pain from muscle spasms and tight ligaments. This pain is due to my severe allergies which I have yet to find a solution for. I will continue to use this product 3 times a day.,4
"Bought this because the price was good.  I don't think it is as tasty as O.N.E. coconut water, but it isn't bad, especially chilled.",4
"I had one of the ""tiger"" boxes of Bengal Spice tea for quite some time, but never tasted it.  When I finally tasted it, I was delighted.  It was superb. (Bengal Spice is, by the way, a combination of spices and of roasted chickory.)<br /><br />I don't care much for green tea.  But Bengal Spice was so good that I was able to steep it with bags of green tea, producing an excellent combination.<br /><br />I couldn't wait to order a six-pack of Bengal Spice. But one of the recent reviews that I had read was correct.  The formulation is dramatically different.<br /><br />The tea that I just received is pretty good.  I only found it to be ""good"" by adding a bit of apple juice.  Unfortunately, it's no longer superb.<br /><br />On well, I guess I'll buy more anyway. I just don't care that much for the taste of green trea.",3
"This is basically the drinkable form of dishwashing soap..First, it has a horrible smell to begin with. Secondly, this product tastes like soap. Vita COCO needs to go and review this product because quite frankly this is the worst tasting drink on the beverage market. Also It has Rihanna's name on it. This means she has tasted this product, proving she has no taste in both beverages and in music.",1
"Upon recieving order, Boston Baked Beans were immediately thrown in the trash. It may be a personal preferrence but, they were hard as a rock and not soft at all where the coating is concerned.They were removed from my list. I ordered a good supply but, was really disapointed. Not so much in the seller but, in the product.",1
"The first bag I tried I wasn't sure about this healthy little snack but they grow on you, so if the taste is a little off for you, don't give up on them, before you know it you'll be reaching for another. They're healthy and the label numbers are real low and that's a good thing.",4
"Stash has done a fine packaging job on its organic green teas.Whether they are the gunpowder which I like(more fond of the Twinings gunpowder).<br />  That being said the Stash Premium Organic Jasmine Green has to be ranked right up there with Rishi Jasmine.If you are familiar with Rishi.<br />  Republic of Tea Jasmine, is better than both of these.However if you are LQQking for a tea that is in a great package,easy to store,easy on the pocketbook and still delivers,then this is the one.Is it the greatest jasmine in the world,no of course not,but it is enough of a great tea for everyday drinking in and out all year long.<br />  Even the best of teas need some time off,but with this one i am never disappointed.<br />  Two minutes brew time at 175 temp, and it doesn't get bitter,and can make a second great cup minus the caffeine.Remember all the caffeine goes into the first cup.You can avoid the caffeine altogether by giving it a flush for 30 seconds in a cup of 175 degree water and then removing the brewing basket.Thanx",4
"We love these animal crackers.  The texture is nice and crunchy, and the flavor is awesome.  My husband loves them so much that he doesn't even mind taking a ""kid snack"" to work.:-)<br />I've also found that if we get a box that's been damaged and broken up - the crumbs make an awesome pie crust!",5
"I love all these different flavors that they have come out with for Blue Diamond almonds.  Soooo Goood.  While this one wasn't as good as the Wasabi flavor, it was still delicious.",4
DANGEROUS BONES!!! Little dogs love these bones because they are tasty BUT they are truly dangerous. Our family Maltese (Pebbles) who had just turned one choked to death on one. They are not even safe if your supervising your dog because our dog choked on one in the presence of my sister. We were unable to do anything for her as we watched in horror as she slowly stopped breathing and got her to the vet in less than ten minutes. The vet attempted an emergency procedure and removed two peices and the bone had also tore her trachea. Her death was caused by these bones. These bones are not worth your precious pets life as it tore our family apart.,1
If I Could Turn Back Time.... I wouldn't have bought this product. The taste is horrible - but I guess all wasn't loss.. My 7 year-old enjoyed it..,2
"First of all the shipping on this product was super fast and took me by surprise.  Second the quality of this product is outstanding.  Finally in Iowa I can drink some restaurant qualiy and tasting Thai tea.  Although the package does not indicate this, sweetened condensed milk is also amazing as a sweetener.  That is how my favorite Thai restaurant in Chicago prepares it.  So basically if you're looking for quality, a great price and authentic Thai taste, this product is what you're looking for!",5
"I don't drink as much water as I should. I figure the extra hydration offsets the drawbacks of the artificial sweeteners. This, shaken into a bottle of water, is tasty without being overly sweet. Two tubes is enough to flavor my widemouthed nalgene. The plastic tubes are sometimes hard to open, but that same plastic packaging makes the tubes durable enough to be thrown in my suitcase or purse.",4
"I love this product.  I use milk straight from grass fed cows and was very curious as to the consistency the yogurt would have.  As expected, the first batch seemed to be a little granular, but the subsequent batches are perfectly smooth and have the good old yogurt taste I remember from my childhood in Europe.",5
"Expected good, full flavor from this tea, recently having finished 2 packets of Japanese Gyokuro. It is bland, and the color of the steeped tea, an unattractive dark brown - with no hint of green.",2
"It's something of a pain to put a genuine mojito mix together, what with making the simple syrup and processing the mint leaves, and, while not claiming that the Crystal Light mix tastes like the real thing, it isn't bad and it's certainly convenient. It is not too sweet, and it has a pleasant, mild minty flavor. I haven't yet tried it with a generous slug of rum but I'm confident that the rum will improve it, and that after a couple of those, one might feel positively enthusiastic about the Moctail Mojito mix.",4
"Nice melon flavor and it lasts but I really didn't taste any lime in there at all.  Still, I would buy it again.",4
Are you tired of drinking diet drinks with artificial flavors and sweeteners? Then Zevia cola might be a good choice. This drink still contains caffeine which I indulge in occasionally when I feel tired or need a little energy boost. This drink seems sweeter than Coke or Pepsi but doesn't have an addictive flavor so you are less likely to over indulge. What is strange about this cola is that it contains nutmeg oil although the flavor is barely discernible. The great thing about this soda is that you don't feel guilty drinking it. You get sweetness without sabotaging your weight-loss efforts.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review,4
"As other reviews have mentioned, this pice is ridiculous.  However the product itself is decent.  I purchased this elsewhere because I love the taste of Diet Coke and read some reviews that  tastes just lke Diet Coke.  (My parents have had a soda fountain in their house since I was 2, I'm 31 now) ...  This tastes alot like Coke but no like Diet Coke(which makes sense, it doesn't use aspartame, it uses the sugar free sugar stuff)<br /><br />It is nice being able to make soda on demand though ...  I'm going to siphon some syrup from my parents and try that (if it works, you can get 5 gallon ""bags"" of Diet Coke from SAMs club, makes 35 gallons of soda)",3
"This is a strange tasting tea; it smells stinky and taste like dried autumn leaves from the yard. It may be good for you, but at a price. I decided to mix this stuff with a breakfast tea to make it palatable.",2
"The dark chocolate truffle flavor overpowers the coffee flavor.  Not the best combination of chocolate and coffee.  The flavors compete against each other, don't blend well, and leave an unpleasant aftertaste.<br /><br />Dark chocolate and dark coffee are two of my favorite things, however Gevalia did not capture the potential of this blend very well.  I wouldn't buy this coffee.  It sounds wonderful, but the actual experience was a letdown.",2
"If you live in any area prone to disaster, this can be a life saver.  If you're without power for a few weeks in an ice storm and you can't get to the grocery store, what's in your freezer won't help you.  If you can boil water for some egg noodles, throw this on top, and you have an easy poor-man's beef stroganoff (too bad you can't get canned sour cream, though).  As others have said, it is also good over rice or mixed with a can of mixed vegetables and canned potatoes for a quick stew.<br /><br />Of course it's not as good as home cooked fresh roast beef.  But I'll bet it would be as good as home canned roast beef if you canned it at home. (Edited based on comment.)<br /><br />If you want something for the occasional quick and easy meal and the comfort of knowing you have something you can eat in a disaster, I think you'll like this.",4
"This has a good hazelnut flavor, but I could not really taste the coffee at all. The flavor is just a bit strong and the coffee is on the weak side. My 18 year old daughter who is just starting to drink coffee and was not allowed to have cafeinne at all growing up, loves it. She is at the Sure I like coffee if I can add half a cup of cream and 6 teaspoons of sugar stage of drinking coffee. She does not have to add nearly that aount to this coffee and she really likes it. She is in college and this coffee has become her study buddy. I would say it has a good flavor to it, but if you like a stronger coffee than this is not for you. If you like coffee as long as it does not taste like coffee, then I highly recommend this one. I do like it. It just does not have that coffee taste and does not really get me going. This is a super light blend in my opinion and I do not like super strong coffee. I am picky about flavored coffee and this one just does not taste like coffee to me.",3
"My cats were SO excited about the smell of this food, but eating it made them vomit instantly. I understand that you need to introduce new foods very carefully and gradually, so it wasn't because I switched them over cold turkey. Even when they were getting only a dollop mixed with their typical food, the vomiting persisted with both cats. THK has worked well for our dog, but if it won't stay down for more than 5 minutes, something is definitely wrong with the cat formula.",2
"Prices for K-cups have escalated in the past six months, and this coffee was at the top end of what I would pay, but the Decaf - which I need after noon - is very good tasting!",4
"put one in your mouth and you'll understand,they're bad. And not just BAD,they're the baddest of the baddest. A black hole of taste.<br /><br />I just want to say that *cough* *cough* *hack* that they're really... *cough* oh forget it!",1
"I should start by saying that I absolutely love these Kind bars..... however, this box was not as fresh as it should be.  The bars were not expired, however, the were on the stale side.",3
"When you say ""mustard"" this is the stuff you should mean-- fragrant, acidic, sublime.  Unfortunately, the price reflects not only the wretched value of the dollar against the Euro, but a 100% tax imposed by the US government!  Imposed during the Clinton years, the 100% tariff on French Mustard still remains on the books-- and it's more than high time it came off! Write your Senators and Reps-- I just picked up two jars in Paris at an overpriced shop there-- at under 10 Euros each!<br />If you can't wait, though, for the wheels of government to grind this mustard fine, exceedingly fine, then pony up the extra dosh and get some. Me, I'll be bringing a bigger suitcase next time, and considerably more than two jars home with me!",5
"The Hazer Baba is good but not great. The texture is a little chewier than the better ones we've had. The taste is decent  though. We were spoiled while in Greece on the real deal. The Ginger People, albeit for twice the price have a five star ginger Turkish Delight that is par with what we remember from Greece. The ginger is there but it's flavor not overwhelmingly spicy and the texture is a little slice of heaven! Jody Koval",3
"When it first came out, this pasta salad was a favorite of mine, particularly for entertaining and for when I needed a quick, cold meal. But I haven't purchased this in over 10 years until now. Not sure if my memory is faulty or if it's changed that much, but it's not nearly as flavorful as I remember, Also, when I first got it it came with mayonnaise packets which was great because I don't use mayonnaise enough to keep it as a staple. The mayonnaise packet made it a lot more convenient for when I had to whip together something on a moment's notice.",2
"So i always thought one had to dig a while before striking the ""motherload"" but this little turkish load hold`s a place of their own. Now i only tried turkish delight once before directly from Turkey and that was ""uncut"" and more firm....yadayadayada...more chewing resistance yadyadayada...but the coconut sprinkle and the presence of nuts wil l give you the chewing resistance needed, because they are rather soft to the bite..almost as winegum wich may be a bit on the soft side. But you certainly get an impression of freshness when biting into these XL sugarbite sized candys. And one more thing, they taste pretty good and they have a nice presentation ""feature"" One star taken as they are a bit too soft to the bite...and munching away at these will land you in the bathroom in the middle of the night..you can take that from me.<br /><br />UPDATE: my other pack which i just dug into had the ""right"" density or chewing resistance if you will. This will make your chewing muscles work for their money. Just how i like it! 5 stars.",4
This product is too processed to be healthy and does not taste good enough eat.  I pitched the whole container.,1
"What can you say about cat food?  Actually this looks and smells good enough to eat (but I'm not going to try it myself).  So I gave it to all four of our cats when they were not particularly hungry (not at a normal meal time) and they all seemed to enjoy it (even the one that often completely refuses to eat anything but ""crunchies"").<br /><br />Reviewing the label it sounds healthy.  The high taurine content is definitely very healthy for cats.  The only ""fault"" I could imagine is the relatively high price (tiny cans and the fact that it has a high moisture content - the moisture is healthy, but you're paying for water).<br /><br />If you can afford to spoil your cats, give this food a try (be careful your kids don't try to eat it by accident {laugh}).",4
"When I first took a bite, I seriously thought I was eating dog food.  These are disgusting.  I searched the bag for ""dog food"" and the expiration date thinking that it was bad for one of those reasons.  I don't know how anyone can like these.",1
"I gave 1 star because I can't go lower!!!<br /><br />I've gone through many different brands of peanut butter over the years, and this one is by far the worst I've ever encountered.  The entire jar was a liquid mess that only by its color did it resemble peanut butter.<br />It wasn't a situation of separation but the entire jar was the consistency of a pudding.<br /><br />I, unfortunately, bought 4 jars of this repellent product and now don't know what to do with it.<br /><br />Avoid them if you can.",1
Love it !  So much better than the already ground lemon peppers found in super markets! Great buy too! The fresh essence provides great aroma as you use this grinder.,5
"I had never used these coffee pods before and used them in my coffee maker without a filter.  I was really expecting the coffee to smell great when it was brewing, but maybe it is to mild.  If you like milder breakfast type coffee or chai tea you will love this coffee.  I added a little light cream and it was very good, be careful with the cream it needs very little.  My first cup I put to much light cream and it overpowered the drink.  I would buy this again, it is something nice to give as a gift or serve to company.",4
"I really enjoy getting good horchata having traveled throughout Latin America and many Mexican restaurants in the US. For the most part, it's a hard drink to mess up if you make it yourself; it may not end up being amazingly delicious, but definitely something worth drinking. When I saw this drink mix in the store, I figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Suffice to say that I was supremely disappointed. I tried it with water, and no amount of drink mix could salvage it from tasting and looking like dirty water. Blech... With milk, it got mildly better, but I would much prefer a glass of milk to the nasty, plastic-y taste this added.<br /><br />Stay away! Look up recipes yourself or maybe try one of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GPNT32"">Imagine Rice Dream Horchata, 32 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>. (I just ordered one, so we'll see how it turns out!)",1
"Formula will work for large-breed puppies, since it has 1.1% calcium.  Maybe not for small breeds.  It settled my pup's upset tummy, and he likes it.  It's definitely better than puppy chow, but not as good as Eagle Pack Holistic lamb large-breed puppy food, e.g. That costs a little more, but I ordered it and am feeding this while waiting for it to arrive. A better food should prevent health problems in the future. This one is not bad, tho.",4
This organic ground cinnamon is  really great! Very tasty and love how you get 3 big bottles of it for a great price! I use ground cinnamon in my natural applesauce(no sugar added) protein poweder mixture and I have that everyday and it added a wonderful cinnamon taste! I would reccomend you lightly sprinkle it carefully or spoon a lil but out because if not this bottle wihich has no shaker top can come out fast and then you have too much cinnamon on your food and it can be very spicy or over powering flavor when you have way too much! If you have just enough its a yummy delicious flavoring for your food!,5
"I really love Kettle brand chips, but these are rather disappointing. There is very little sour cream or onion flavor.",2
"This is nice if you like it not so sweet, but I am the type that prefers my apple cider on the sweeter side. It is nice that I can make one cup as needed, or many if I have friends over.",4
Tastes horrible!  Has an after taste...don't recommend.  Would not buy again and am still looking for a liquid product with glucosamine that doesn't taste this bad.,1
"The last time I bought this product on Amazon I paid more than twice as much as I did this time.I would like to know why the large disparity in price. It is a good product, if we get a steady supply at a good price.",4
Within the last year I have had to go gluton free which of course requires a whole new diet.  Finding gluton free products that have the same taste that I'm used to has been difficult.  Pamela's gluton free PANCAKE MIX is one of the few products that I have found that I can truly say is pre gluton free tasty.<br /><br />Heels,5

"For those who grew up with Kellog's Corn Flakes and still like them, Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut provide an alternative that avoids one of the faults of its long standing predecessor:  this cereal does not get soggy in less that five minutes!  Despite the ""Golden Honey"" title, this is not a super-sweet kids cereal that will give you sugar shock with every bite.  It is tasty, has the flavor of real cereal and not sugar coated cardboard, and is an enjoyable morning eat.",4
"The herb kit I received with the Aerogarden unit was unimpressive.<br /><br />Most of the seeds failed to germinate.<br /><br />I have had no problems with their cherry tomato kit, which have grown about 2 inchs in only 9 days.",2
"This is good!  No, you probably don't want to use the largest setting because it will water it down, but I like this.  It's creamy and sweet and just the thing after a hard day at work.  It's probably not on my diet, though.  :)",4
Absolutely love this product so tasty I can eat a bag in a couple of hours. I'm hooked on this stuff. It is sweeter than some of the other blends but not too sweet. A good amount of nuts in it as well.,5
"The product description claims ""It contains no high-fructose corn syrup in regular flavors and no aspartame in diet flavors."" This is true - instead ALL of the 12 sample flavors we got with our machine contain SPLENDA (sucralose), whether ""diet"" or not! You have to read the fine print to discover this. Prior to reading the fine print, we tried the root beer: hmm, tastes like root beer but with an artificial after-taste. Then the ""Dr. Pepper"": hmm, tastes like Dr. Pepper but with an artificial after-taste. Checked the fine print: sugar, PLUS SPLENDA. Who would have thought the NON-diet flavors would contain SPLENDA? We threw the remaining 10 sample packs out and will look elsewhere for flavorings that don't sneak artificial sweeteners in - Monin syrups come to mind.",1
"I have several allergies, that cause migraines, and cannot have regular breadcrumbs. I've been looking for a good substitute, and found these at our local natural food store. They were horrible, I could tell from the way they looked(it looks like Corn Meal, not corn flakes)they were going to be bad, but since I spent so much on them I had to try. They wouldn't stick to the pork chop, they wouldn't brown, and when I put in the toaster oven to keep warm, it made the pork chop all soggy. No flavor at all.<br />Disgusting..don't waste your $$ on this!",1
"I've had many different types of Starbucks coffee and there are very few I don't like. I don't really care for the more mild blends but this has a nice taste to it. I usually prefer a dark bold brew like French but this milder tasting coffee did not disappoint. It has a smooth subtle vanilla flavor and is a nice alternative for a change. The smell of vanilla fills the kitchen as it brews.<br /><br />It's made with Latin American beans and has natural ingredients. Bring the empty bag to Starbucks when you're done and you'll get a free coffee.<br /><br />Overall, the taste/quality i'll give 4 stars.",4
"This coffee is just not for me; the vanilla gave the coffee an off-note I just didn't like.<br /><br />I tried.  I really did.  I brewed it a cup at a time, a pot at a time, by drip, Chemex, and French press.  Each and every time, it was a no go for me.<br /><br />For the record, I like my coffee strong and black.  I'm sure that if you add a lot of sugar and cream, this would be just fine.<br /><br />But for coffee purists, pass this one by.",3
"I received a variety of Stash teas as a Bridal Shower souveneir over a year ago. I'm sorry i took so long to bust 'em open. Stash is an amazing quality with natural tasting, comforting flavours in both the Herbal and Black Tea lines. I am so impressed, I've become a Stash convert.<br /><br />This Double Chai is very well balanced in it's spices, but still comforting and yet refreshing at the same time. I made mine mostly according to the directions (tea is easy that way), but i did use sweetened condensed milk instead of regular milk and sugar. It may not be 'Starbucks Quality' as one reviewer lamented, but I'm sure the beauty of Chai is that it can be well made in a variety if different ways. And while i've never been big into Chai, in the future, I'm definitely going to keep a stock of this Chai tea in my pantry. And unlike many other common brands of black tea, this one does not go bitter after 5-10 minutes of steeping. I'm used to having to be vigilant about removing the bag after 3 minutes, because I'm sensitive to the bitter over-steeped taste of lower quality black teas. That was not at all an issue with either of the black teas I've tried from this company. I can't wait to buy more Stash Teas.",5
"I have two cats that are very picky eaters, sometime ago I found out about weruvia and they seemed to really enjoy it. So, in order to keep my furry friends happy and save some money I purchased weruvia online, and to my my surprise one of them would not eat it at all. I discovered that the food I purchased online unlike the one I was buying at the pet store was made in Thailand. I found a can from a previous purchase which had been made in the USA and the cat ate it without a problem. So, I wondering if anyone has had the same problems???",1
"My husband loves these.  They are pretty good.  They are moist so they are not like ""real"" jerky in that sense but otherwise the texture is very similar.  I wish they had a variety that wasn't so sweet but I definitely recommend trying some before getting an entire package - luckily I got to try each of them, which are all good.",4
"While the roast is  described  as medium it is actually a nice but slightly bitter dark roast which is completely without the promised floral notes that are expected in a good Yirgacheffe Ethiopian coffee. A true medium roast would have preserved the floral and fruity notes that are present in a good Yirgacheffe.  Otherwise, this is an OK feel good coffee for Senseo and Senseo compatible pod cofee makers.  It is both Fair Trade and Organic certified and promotes or sponsors the coffee kicks charity while trading on the Marley name.  However, there is a lot of necessarily sturdy packaging which blunts the organic and sustainable claims for me.  As is standard for Senseo pods, each pod has only enough coffee for 5-6 ounces of strong  coffee. Use two for a mug if you prefer strong coffee.",3
"I love some of the other Oskri bars, and when I found this one, I was thinking coconut with clusters of crunchy almonds. Shades of Almond Joy, which I can't have because of the sugar, etc., but these are a disappointment. They're big, and that's usually a plus, but I'm tired of it about midway through a bar. There may be 2 or 3 almonds throughout the bar, but they're soft, so you have to see one to know you've eaten an almond. The coconut and level of sweetness are good, but it simply gets boring after a bite or two. So, I've got a whole box of 'em to eat. Waste not, want not. I'll go back to the other Oskri bars, like the Almonds and Cranberry fiber bar.",2

"Hi!  I'm Twisty and I love the Grass that my Mom bought for me.  It didn't all grow and it didn't get real tall but I think that is because Mom loves me so much she just couldn't wait for it to grow big.  But she was smart; because she bought two.  Imagine that,two Kitty Garden's for one Smart Cat.  I eat my grass for a snack and also when my tummy is a little upset.  I eat it and when it get's short my Mom gives me the other one.  I have feline leukemia so I can't go out any more so as an indoor cat this grass is very important to me.  I think every Smart Cat should have a smart Mom like my Mom.",4

I went into K-cups to order K-cups.  This product didn't have an image and I didn't read the product carefully - after all I went into K-cups - why would there be another product in K-cups or why wasn't there an image.  Also didn't read that this item is nonreturnable.  Now I have coffee that I can't use.  Lesson learned - don't order when there is no image available and read the fine print!,1

"I love Nature Valley Crunchy Granola Bars and I love chocolate. But these new granola thins are disappointing and not up to the same standards of other Nature Valley products, imo. They're simply granola wafers with chocolate on top and the granola wafers taste old (something that I've never experienced with other Nature Valley products.) To top it off, they're actually expensive in comparison to Nature Valley's other, much better, products. If you want a good granola and chocolate product, try Nature Valley's Crunchy Dark Chocolate bars, which offer a mixture of cocoa and oats, with chunks of dark chocolate. Unlike these, they're delicious!",2
We did a taste test with Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn and 1 out 3 liked the popcorn. We found it had an after taste and was a weird texture. I found that fudge was nice taste but I passed after two peices.  One who loved them was my 13 year old son who finished the box this week. I would pass - make some popcorn and enjoy!,3

The absolute best baking product of its kind---I have tried almost ALL gluten-free baking products and Bisquick Gluten Free is by far the BEST!!!  A little expensive but worth the money!!!!!,5
Not one of my Stash favorites but it's supposed to be good for you so I bought it.  It's a bit too fruity and sweet for my taste but if that's what you like than this tea is for you.,4
"Chef Michael might be a fictional character in the same vein as Aunt Jemima and the Keebler Elves, but that doesn't excuse him from putting some truly nasty ingredients into his Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food. So many other reviewers have pointed out the list of dubious ingredients that it doesn't pay to duplicate them again, but I urge you to take a long, hard look at that list before you commit to purchasing this item.<br /><br />Nutrition aside, this is a very tasty food item based on my dogs' response to finding it in their bowl. Frankly, they went bonkers over Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food. I'm probably not going to make this part of their regular diet, but I will continue using it as a treat.",2
I really like this product.  Sometimes I don't feel like cooking and this is good for a quick meal.  I've liked this food since I was little.  It's still good.  Thank you.,5

A healthy 15 year old with the expected stiff hips and a romping 9 year old who has dry joints (who doesn't?).  They both love the taste and I'm happy not to have to crunch up the supplements into their food everyday.  I love the healthy ingredients and lack of fillers, I believe that is why my dogs live long lives. I put it on auto ship!  Yay! No more trips for the forgotten dog food!!  Thanks Amazon!",5
"This tea is spiced with other spices than bergamont and while the tea seems of good quality its taste it unlike an Earl Grey.  It tastes almost sweet and more like an herbal than a black tea.  If you are looking for an Earl Grey, this certainly is not it.",2
"This is the second order recently received that contained a case of stale pretzels.  Every bag was stale.  No excuse with posted expiration date over 6 months out.<br /><br />Until recently I have had no complaints with the quality of these pretzels, and my family has really enjoyed them.  But now having paid over $60 for 2 stale cases, you will lose a good customer if this happens again.",1
I am really impressed with the Tanka Buffalo sticks. Great flavor without being too spicy and a great post work out treat! A little dry but otherwise perfect.,4
"So I bought these for my wife because she is into fitness and had heard about these noodles from people she works out with. Apparently they are zero calorie fillers and make it easier when cutting to lower your carb intake. When she opened the bag, there was a definite hint of fishiness. I was skeptical that they would be good, but she cooked them up and added a decent sauce and I couldn't really taste anything awry. I can't really say they are good or bad tasting, because they pretty much take on the flavor of whatever you eat them with. They were pretty satisfying and made me feel full for quite a while. I guess they are just fiber. Overall, I find them to be a bit expensive as a means of taking in zero calories. If I want to do that in the future I will just eat less. If I were a weaker person, however, that needs to feel full all the time, these might be a great solution.",4
"If you like then then you would love Orange Crush. A friend got this for me while he was down south (lower 49 states). They sell as 4 pack for $20 = $5 a bottle, way over price when you can get (basically) the same thing for $1 a liter.<br /><br />Over all, I think the price is for the bottle, not the content.",3
"This is my new Nutella.....This craze is taking over.  I found it to be addictive. My husband who hates toasts & spreads & jams, ate 2 sandwiches!! I myself could not believe it. I have already tasted Biscoff cookies a few years ago.  And when I saw this at the local Walmart, I decided to give it a try.  I already picked up French bread from the bakery and completely surprised by the $1 instant coupon on top the lid ($1 off when you purchase French Bread)!!  So, the next day, for breakfast, there was this wonderful toast with Biscoff spread.  And I also tried it on apple slices.  YUMMY!!  But the only downside (if any) is that it could taste good only with bread* and apples, maybe because of cinnamon. But then, bread and apples are good for you! My 3-year old son (A very picky eater, most of the times plainly refusing to try new stuff) ate this and asked for more.  I remember going gaga over nutella when it hit the aisles. This is the newest entry and here-to-stay spread.<br /><br />As one negative review calls it greasy, well, nutella is.  And so is butter or vegetable oil spread.  When it tastes yummy and it is vegan, it is a good-to-go product.  As for calories, if you are on diet, why are you even here reading about spreads?  A smear or two on toasts everyday cannot do any harm.  I went ahead and made my own French bread and tried it.  OMG, deadly.<br /><br />P.S: *Bread means all kinds of breads like plain scones, bagels, muffins etc.  BTW, I also melted it for a few seconds in the Microwave and used it as a dip for homemade soft pretzels - WOW!!  I am now thinking of using it as cake filling or icing.  I bet it will work especially on apple cake!!",5
Tastes like melted plastic.  I will not buy this ever again nor would I recommend it to anyone else.  Ick!,1
I have been looking for tubed ginger and thought I had finally found it. But the shipping for this item costs more than the item. that drives the cost way up. No a good value buy.,3
I used to love this grape drink powder but not only the packaging has changed but the flavor is different as well and it does not taste as good as it previously did.  I will not be re-ordering this flavor again.,3
This product totally reminds me of Lipton Lemon ice tea. It was really really good. Makes for a good sleep and relaxation aid.,3
"I have one cup a day and it really decreases my night sweats. I'm in amazement at how much it helps!<br /><br />The taste isn't great, but I don't think it's as bad as some other reviews have said. If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup. It tastes pretty much the same, but it didn't seem cost effective to use the sage you buy in the spice aisle.",4
"I'd give it three and a half stars, couldn't decide between 3 and 4.<br /><br />I use a lot of nutritional yeast, mostly for popcorn flavoring. The taste of this one isn't my favorite. It is a rather strong taste, but I'm glad to have it for variety. Good value for the money.<br /><br />It is a dense powder. Most of them are light and flaky. This means I can keep a lot more in a small container at work.",4
"The Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa Diet mix is the best low calorie dessert I've found!  It's better than a chocolate bar, as it tastes as good and has only 25 calories, and cascium and Vitamin D.  What a great way to end a meal!  Highly recommended!",5
"These biscuits are pretty big for a small dog.  Brownie doesn't love it, he took it and then dropped it without eating it, then he went for the Old Mother Hubbard biscuit instead.",4
"Unfortunately, this product is now made in China, so I no longer buy this product for my dogs, since China tends to add garbage to pet treats.",1
"We have tried just about every k-cup of regular coffee out there.  We don't do the flavor kind.  My husband loves the GM brand most of the coffees are mild (even when they say medium roast)...I go for a little more on the medium roast like the some of the Tully's and Caribou brands.  It used to be that we were always ordering the same brands, once we liked a certain one.  But I ventured to try the Wolfgang Puck line.  While this flavor is touted as a medium roast, it seems to be more on the bold side with a little bitterness.  It is still not a bad coffee, just not as good as the ""Rodeo Drive"" or ""Breakfast in Bed"" k-cups which has no bitterness.  I must say though, we have now added the latter 2 flavors of Wolfgang to our buying ritual.",3
"The oil was fine but the glass bottle not stable due to small bottom surface with rounded edges. Thus it slipped off its shelf and shattered on the floor. Big waste, big mess. Luckily I like the odor because it soaked in. Big job to clean up with broken glass. Baking soda, I hope, will absorb the bulk of that which remains, staining my floor. And I can go out and buy a product that garages use in oil spill clean up. In the future I will buy only plastic-bottled sesame oil. And hope I remember to check the bottle's bottom for common-sense stability.<br /><br />UPDATE: Now, in August of 2012, I want to reiterate my observation of how unstable this glass bottle is. I wound up with a second bottle of this brand - it was given to me - and the same thing happened. It is simply not stable on the shelf or in the door of a refrigerator where I keep such oils due to their potential to become rancid at higher temperatures; nor would it be stable on a cupboard shelf. There are several other brands of sesame oil available.",2
"This is a very nice tea.  Not too light, not too heavy.  Good for breakfast or even later in the day.  Rather mild but without any fruity taste.  Just a good solid English tea.",4
"Growing up in Europe as a kid leaves a huge mark on your sweet tooth, being spoiled by the flavor and quality anything sweet left in your mouth. Nutella is one of those sweet memories that unfortunately did not carry over to North America.  Made in, out of all the places in Industrial area of New Jersey, is not a good starting point for launching one of Europeans favorite chocolate wonders! Some ingredients do not stick with original standards, adding processed ingredients, still using sugar, which is better than corn fructose. topping it off by putting the product in plastic jars! At this point I suggest a sugar cube, topping it off with Hershey's syrup, if this is what you like, then you will love New Jersey made Nutella, it will be like Christmas. If you want to try real Nutella, buy the European version in a real glass jar, with real ingredients, real milk. German, and Polish is the real deal.",1
"The whole family loves these.  I seem to grab them on my way out the door because I didn't have time for a ""real"" breakfast.  I don't feel bad becuase they're not full of additives and preservatives, and they are organic and yummy!",4
"The chocolates seemed to have been frozen at some time and looked a bit off.  Until I wrapped them for a Christmas gift, I did not notice they had an expiration date of 12/31/09.  Considering I bought them in November, I was NOT happy.  I will be very careful in future with some purchases.",2
"Good for Japanese cooking (dashi), and my cat loves it.  Good price compared with other dried bonito flake sources I've tried.",5
"I am very disappointed that Gerber has added DHA to their green beans. My son used to Love his Gerber Organic Green Beans. I (unwittingly) tried feeding him the new formulation with added DHA and he kept refusing it. I did notice that the consistency was different than usual - it had more of a gel like texture to it. And then I read the ingredients and saw that it had added Tuna Oil. !? Today I learned that another of his favorites, Gerber Organic Carrots, now has DHA added to it too. I'm so frustrated! Looks like I'll be making our own baby food now.",1
Again if you love Hot or Spicy products You are going to love this one! My son just love this item and can literialy the whole jar by itself.,5
"I have a hard time believing Benriach 15 Dark Rum cask finished single malt whiskey is really aged 15 years. It's tow-headed pale yellow: among the lightest colored whiskey's I've ever seen. The aroma is nice - marshmallow, cake batter and butterscotch. With extended time a clear pineapple note comes to dominate the aroma. The pineapple and butterscotch aroma (pineapple upside down cake?) is yummy. On the tongue it is filigreed and lacy. Cerial honey, cake batter up front. There are some fruit esters at midpalate (apricot and sugar cane) and distant wood notes at the finish which is moderately short. My issue here is that there is too little oomph. What flavor there is here is nice - but there's a bit too little for my taste. Looking, smelling, and drinking this I would guess it has 8 years in the wood - not 15.",3
"THIS Box is big. Compared to your normal box at walmart, This is like massive when you think about it.<br />I brought it for me and my mom, so I could practice cooking. But after cooking the second box making, it's like eating the same food for a month. It's best to just buy ONE from another seller. Cause it can and will get boring fast.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong ~<br />I love shells & cheese, but sometimes.<br />The calories, and the.. fat-grams..

"I have been ordering Xango mangosteen juice for  nearly 4 years, and was pleasantly surprised to see it on Amazon.com.  I saved approximately $15 in shipping, which was very nice!  I will continue to order the Xango mangosteen juice in the hopes of preventing colds, cancer, and chronic disease because of all of the antioxidant benefits in it!  Thank you Amazon.com for being so diverse in what you sell!",5
"I really like this brand of cheese sticks. They have great flavor, not an overwhelming 'chemical cheese' taste, and they don't rely on a ton of salt as do so many other snacks like these. Unfortunately, they came from ""Warehouse Deals"". They are packed by the manufacturer in a box of 12 designed for transport on pallets in semis to stores. That means the manufacturer's packaging is not designed to have a label stuck on it and then be tossed around by UPS, or FedEx, or whomever is delivering it. I received twelve boxes of cheese stick crumbs!!!! DO NOT ORDER IF ""Warehouse Deals"" is the vendor!!!!!!",4
"I like this cereal, but then again I like almost any kind of cereal. The product definitely lives up to its name and stays crunchy in milk; it is great as a dry snack, too. Flavor-wise, it reminded my of a cross between Honey Nut Cheerios and Ohs; there was a nice balance between the roasted nut and honey flavors. I'll buy this if I ever see it on sale; otherwise, I'll stick with the generic (but just as flavorful) cereals that cost much less.",4

"I've heard that there truly is no differene between cheap shampoos and those found at specialty salons/stores. I've tried both and it is probably true. That said, this new Clear Shampoo is certainly on the cheap side, and so far, I like it. It has a pleasant smell and it goes on thick, with a consistancy of conditioner. It lathers very well and washes away quickly. It cleans my hair and I guess I can't expect much more than that. So far it has not weighed my hair down at all, and I have pretty long hair. I would recommend this shampoo to anyone.",4
"I enjoy dark strong coffee like Starbucks, french roast and sumatra.  I don't enjoy coffees with a sweet tangy flavor such as Dunkin Donuts and Gevalia.  To begin with, the Keurig Brewer tends to brew a slightly less bold or strong coffee than traditional methods such as a french press or even slow drip.  So for me, nothing other than extra bold K-cups will do the trick in the Keurig Brewer.  The strength of the Extra Bold Rainforest is strong enough for my taste (could be even a litte stronger).  The flavor is slightly smoky and rich but also slightly bitter with an almost stringent chemically after taste.  This however, is normally not noticeable.  I only notice it after immediately tasting another coffee.  Gloria Jeans Black Gold Extra Bold is smoother but also not as bold.",4
"We bought the 6 pound pack of these rawhide rolls and found out they were hollow on the inside.  We understand that they are sold by weight, but the 'hollowness' causes the rawhide to chip off and be eaten quite quickly and somewhat dangerously as choking is a potential problem with the broken off pieces.",2
"If you've bought SB wraps before and have enjoyed them, then have no hesitations about ordering them from Amazon. You'll get great service. However, I must say that these wraps aren't that tasty. They also tear very easily. I tried using them as sandwich wraps- didn't work out so well. So, now I use them for wraps whenever I'm making a baked Mexican dish. The sauce, vegetables, and spices covers up their not-so-great flavor and it doesn't matter if they break open.",3
"Great full-bodied, organic coffee with medium acidity. The addition of yerba mate to the arabica beans gives this coffee a nice, mildly sweet, finishing note. The cost is reasonable for the coffee. I drink many types of organic, gourmet coffee. This rates as one of my top three all time favorites.",5
the seller was fast to ship and at this time the plant looks ok .... but it is way to large for such small pot roots were all taped to the side of the pot ... and i broke many trying to remove all the tape and now i am not sure it will live ... we will see,3
"I was surprised when opening the package this product came in and found this ""Lickety Stik"" device.  It looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant and that's how it works.  My first dog liked it and figured out she is supposed to lick it, but my other dog wasn't sure what to do with it and wanted to chew it.  This is worrisome because if he got hold of it, he may turn it into a bunch of plastic slivers and I wouldn't want him swallowing those.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik treat is a new concept and I understand the idea, but I don't think it's quite there yet.  It's also a little unusual to stand there holding the pets' treat.  Usually, when giving a pet a treat, I expect to get a few minutes of peace and quiet while he/she is enjoying the treat. There are no directions on the bottle, so I wasn't sure how to use it at first, but it didn't take long to figure out.  You just hold it in front of the dog and they have to do the figuring.<br /><br />I probably won't be buying this again.",2
"I was disappointed when I tried these. I was expecting a wintergreen flavor with a texture similar to the dipping sticks included in Fun-Dip, at least that's how I remember them tasting fifteen years ago. I wouldn't be surprised if the company that originally manufactured the original either went out of business or discontinued them as these were probably very controversial.<br /><br />This item tastes more chewy and chaulky and there's not much flavor other than sugar with a waxy coating. I can't help but compare these to antacids. They are also thinner and bent and look more like a hand-rolled cigarette than one that is mass-produced.<br /><br />I would like to add that even though I consumed candy cigarettes as a kid, I do not smoke as an adult. My parents and school always reminded me of the negative effects of smoking so I honestly never had an interest, but I do ironically enjoy candy cigarettes, but sadly these aren't what I remember.",3
"I bought this because lots of people said it had a natural nutty flavor, but my wife and I find it pretty much unusable. I still try to mix it in water and chug it as quickly as possible. It's not easy to hide in foods or sauces either (this is unlike nutritional yeast, which also tastes good on its own). I would give this one star, but I know a lot of people get this for its health benefits and not its flavor, but the flavor is so bad I rarely use it so I'm not getting the health benefits anyway. Of course, taste is a personal thing, but we were hoping this would be a good source of protein and nutrients for our vegetarian diets and we were quite disappointed.",3
"I got Teryaki flavored of the mega packs and yuck! The jerky was so hard and crunchy and old.... It said that it expires in 2013 but still it tastes so nasty so i threw it away and got a refund for my purchace. Amazon is great but these people sell nasty jerky, just go to the store to buy jerky",1
Having not had the childhood experience of this brand<br />I had no clue what to expect-Shipping was ridiculously fast<br />(ordered Sat. received Monday) taffy is fairly soft and fresh...not<br />sure I'm crazy about the taste.  The banana usually is my favorite..but this brand has NOTHING on Laffy Taffy banana flavored which is a superior banana flavor IMO.....the one chocolate piece really didn't taste chocolate-y-more pastey....strawberry was bland...vanilla was the only one that was ok-will be putting this tub out in the office kitchen area for co-workers to pick on as I'm not taking it home- and will look around for a better tasting brand of taffy like I used to eat on the boardwalk---and by the way...what IS up with the lack of chocolate ones? I thought the reviews must be off--but noooooooooo...we only found ONE in the entire little bucket TOO FUNNY!,2
"Be sure to do your homework re: this product before purchasing.  I have three dogs, and they were all getting sick once Canidae changed their ""formula"" late summer to early fall.  Once I googled the product and read the many complaints, all with dogs with the same symptoms, I immediately took my dogs off of the food, and they've been healthy again since.  I'll never trust this product again, and had been a loyal customer for 3+ years.",1

"I love their fuji apple so gave their asian pear a try. But when it came in I was a first suspicious, as the picture on the bags showed a pear shaped pear and not a round asian pear. I should have looked more closely at the picture before ordering it. It definitely did not taste like a sweet asian pear. I and my child was extremely disappointed.<br /><br />I'm not sure what kind of asian pear they used, but it's not the sweet round asian pear that we know and love.",1
"Being one of only six people in the world that eat and likes fruit cake, I was disappointed in this product. It has alot of fruit in it but the cake is dry and crumbly. My wife who hates fruit cake likes it, does this tell the story?",3
"I was fooled into getting this as BJ's because it was cheaper then the boxes, and there is a reason! It's not pure and it tastes like crap. It has a lot less Potassium in the 14 ounce bottom (569) compared to 700+ in the boxes that are 3 ounces smaller! Stick with the boxes, trust me!",1
"I have two dogs, one Black Labrador and one Chihuahua.  The Lab can't get enough of this stinky treat and even tries to grab it from me with her teeth.  She will lick on it all day if I let her. The Chihuahua sniffs it and snubs it. She couldn't be less interested. So, one out of two dogs loves this stinky treat.  Humans, on the otherhand, hate the strong smell.  I think it's fun and can imagine it is a great treat substitute for obese dogs who need to watch their calorie intake. If you aren't adverse to strong odors you'll love the handiness of this Lickety Stik!",4
I have bought cases of this before and then just restocked my home with more cases. The ones I just got kind of taste old. The date isnt old but they are still worth buying. They are easy and a quick meal!,3
This was less sugar than I was expecting. 4 oz is barely enough for rolling one batch of cookies.,3

"I enjoy the occasional tea, and am a fan of organic foods. This lemon ginseng tea tastes like neither. I'm sure it's very healthy, but the taste and consistency makes you feel like you just swallowed a mouthful of 409. The fruity lemon aftertaste isn't enough to offset the very 'non-tea' flavor. Davidson's brand makes several flavors, and maybe some of the other flavored teas are better, I don't know. But this lemon ginseng flavor is awful stuff. Unless you're a hardcore tea aficionado I'd steer clear of this one.",2
Love this bar. Taste great and no preservatives. Great for children instead of a candy bar. Made with all natural ingredients.,5
"I purchased my 1st order of Miracle Noodle directly from: [...]. I got them for my Mother because she needs to switch to a diet of less carbs and far less calories overall. I purchased the 10 pack of 7oz ""Angel hair"" noodles for $21.99 w/10.89 for shipping for a total of $32.76. A few days later I received the package. I was VERY surprised to find out that each 7oz package of Miracle Noodles ACTUALLY contained OVER 6 3/4 ounces of WATER and LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodles!!! While their marketing material does BARELY mention Water content, they are neither CLEAR nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for OVER 85% of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to IMMEDIATELY RINSE the Noodles before use, it's not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this WATER! - Well for a couple of reasons (including but not limited to the WATER volume) I decided to return them without opening even 1 package so they were COMPLETELY UNUSED). I was instructed (during a PHONE CALL to their main office) to MAIL THEM BACK  (AT MY EXPENSE) and WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A FULL REFUND. Well it cost me approx another $10 to ship them back (due to the WATER WEIGHT)and a few days later I received a refund of $21.99. I PAID SHIPPING BOTH WAYS!!! So BASICALLY I PAID $20 in shipping to get a $22 so called REFUND - I PAID $42.00 and GOT BACK ONLY $21.99 !!! This may be legal but it is UNETHICAL and WRONG and when I spoke to the rep on the phone this was never mentioned! Especially for a company that claims to STAND BEHIND IT's PRODUCT 100%!!! When I contacted them by email they informed me that ""THIS IS OUR POLICY"" and cited the requisite schpeal on their website. I was NOT informed of this ON THE PHONE CALL at all! This so-called POLICY should be CHANGED! It may be legal but it's hardly ETHICAL or RIGHT! When is OK to get back ONLY HALF of what you spend when you return a product? IT'S NOT!! Not to MENTION THE FACT that YOU're getting LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodle in a 7 OZ ""Package!!! RIDICULOUS!! Oh and to make matters worse: When I COMMENTED on their Shipping Policy and Water Weight on their FACEBOOK Fan page; instead of addressing the issues OPENLY, HONESTLY and DIRECTLY they IMMEDIATELY and REPEATEDLY DELETED my COMMENTS and then BLOCKED ME from making comments at all! What's that tell you???",1
What is up with the pricing?  $30 for 4 boxes of cereal?  $7.50 per box??  Please correct the pricing on this item!!,2
"It has a very solid kick. Beyond that, it's just a tasty ramen. I currently have 22 cups left sitting on my floor, and I have no doubt that I'll get through all of them pretty quickly. Easy to make like every other ramen cup, but it is spicier than most. Very good.",5
"My dog went nuts when the box arrived with the Beneful inside. She sniffed, chewed, and scratched. She loved eating it too and wolfed it down in moments. I think she really liked the moist chunks and seemed to fish them out before eating the rest.<br /><br />So our dog gives it 5 stars but I'm not sure her vet or her health would give it that. The first ingredient in this dog food is corn, not great nutritional content. According to DogFoodAdvisor dot com the next ingredient is ""chicken by-product meal, a dry rendered product of slaughterhouse waste. In a nutshell, chicken by-products are those unsavory leftovers usually considered 'unfit for human consumption'"". And then it goes to corn gluten meal. Dog Food Advisor gives it 1 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />So, although it must taste great, it is not nutritionally great for your best furry friend (or hairless in the case of Chinese Crested!).",2
Not very good and got moldy pretty quickly.  Ended up feeding it to the dog.  :(,2
These snacks are so delicious! Sadly during the shipping there was minimal cracking of the small crackers. Although it isn't an issue to me because my family and I just eat them plain; it may be for some who serve it with a parfait and want excellent presentation or something like that. But that was just my experience. Will be purchasing more most likely when we run out.,4
"Packaging is very easy to open, for me it does taste a little too salty but still enjoyable. I have a 6oz. popcorn maker however when I use the entire packet towards the end it want's to pop off the top so I may try the 4oz. next time. The only complaint I have is when I received this package due to the extreme heat we have had this summer by the time I received it some of the packets the oil/butter had leaked through and was a little messy as I had to wipe off each packet and throw away a couple.",4
I just finished a can for the first time and it was so bland that I had to write a review somewhere. No taste whatsoever. I would pass if I were you. Chunky has some pretty good soup but this isn't one of them.,1
In the search for grain free dry cat food picked this one to try.  It simply caused diarrhea from day 1 to my 18 month himalayan.,1
I would be much happier with this product if it was not made in China. Although my dogs love Happy Hips I do not give them to my 5 dogs as much anymore now that I have discovered they are made in China where many unsafe dog products are manufactured. I have received emailed cautionary warnings about chicken jerky for dogs that is made in China causing liver and kidney damage so I give these only as a rare treat.,3
"--+My Order+--<br />Put my order in June 15th, plant arrived at my door on June 20th, with most of that time being spent in ""preparing to ship"" status.  Once it did ship, it got here very quickly.  Good sized chunk of cactus too.  Overall it was probably around 15 inches long, potted in good sandy soil that was still moist, good and green.  I immediately transplanted it into a container (I live too far North to plant it in the ground), and was impressed with how well rooted it was.  This was not a fresh cutting that had just barely gotten started, it had a fairly massive rootball, which was quite excellent.  They obviously gave this thing some TLC before shipping (that or I ordered so late in the season it had rooted exceptionally well waiting for somebody to buy it).  Either way, I was quite happy with it.<br /><br />--+Overview, What is Dragonfruit?+--<br />Dragonfruit (DF), also known as Pitaya or Pitahaya, is a tropical cactus most commonly grown in Vietnam and Asia as a commercial fruit.  There are many different cultivars (that is, kinds) of DF falling into three broad catagories.  First are the whites, which is what you'll get from this purchase.  They have pink rinds with white flesh inside.  Second are the reds, which look like the whites on the outside, but have red/purple flesh.  Third are the yelllows, which have a yellow rind with white flesh.  You will also see pinks, which are a hybrid of the white and red varieties.  Different cultivars of each type will have different characteristics (different ease of growing, differing taste, etc).  Unfortunately, this listing does not specificy exactly which kind we're getting, so its next to impossible to tell until you get the fruit (and even then you probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference unless you've personally tried them all).<br /><br />Flavor wise, DF tends to be mild and sweet, with the larger fruits having a stronger flavor (as opposed to some tomatoes that tend to water down the bigger they get).  The red varieties are generally sweeter than the whites, but are not as visually striking in my opinion.  The mild flavor means they they will be overpowered easily by other flavors (I wouldn't say they're bland, but don't expect a flavor explosion like an orange or strawberry would give).  Texture wise, DF are very similar to watermelon.<br /><br />Only the insides of the fruit are edible.  The pink rind is similar to that of a watermelon in that you cut through it to get to the flesh inside.  The small black seeds are edible, giving a nice crunchy contrast to the otherwise soft flesh.  Most commonly a DF is cut in half lengthwise or cut into slices like an apple.  While DF will *NOT* keep in a refridgerator for extended periods, many people prefer to chill fresh fruit before eating.  The red varieties are also good for juicing.<br /><br />--+Growing your Dragonfruit+--<br />DF may come from a cactus, but it has very different soil requirements from a normal cactus.  As a tropical, it requires rich organic soil, and slightly more frequent watering.  Don't bother with standard cactus mix, as it typically doesn't have the nutrients or the drainage requirements to really help your DF take off.  Instead, try for a standard potting soil mixed with equal parts perlite.  DF are more easily suceptible to root rot than normal, so you don't want to keep the soil wet.  It will require regular watering, but when in doubt, underwatering is better than overwatering.  Try to let the soil dry out between waterings, only watering once or twice a week.  Once your DF grows new limbs, they will be thinner and you can gently bend one to know when to water it.  If it flexes easily, its time to water.  If its stiff, leave it be.<br /><br />DF are climbers.  Like grapes or other vines, you will need to supply it something to grow up, the cactus is not capable of supporting itself once it gets bigger otherwise.  In plantations, the most common method is to wrap a pole in burlap for it to grow up, but any untreated wooden trellise should suffice.  Your pole/trellise should be at least 5 feet tall.  DF produce fruit mainly on hanging sections, not whats growing up your pole, so at the top put a crossbar or two for it to climg out over and hang down from.  This will make your DF look like a small palm tree.  You could also build a box frame like structure for it to grow in, or even grow along a fence.  How you end up doing it will depend greatly on where you live.<br /><br />When your DF gets big enough to need support, you will see it start to grow tendrils (actually air roots) that it uses to latch on to whatever is nearby.  These air roots are fully functional, sometimes becoming more important to the plant's health than the underground roots.  Occassionaly water these air roots with a mister with some balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) mixed in to help it along.  An occassional feeding with the same balanced fertilizer to the roots help promote growth as well.<br /><br />DF tolerate temperatures up to ~105°F, down to roughly freezing.  It can stand a light frost, but any prolonged periods of below freezing temperatures will kill it.  This means it can only be planted outdoors (permanently) in regions like Florida, Southern California, south Texas, etc.  Farther north, you'll need to keep it in a container to keep it alive long enough to produce fruit.  Luckily, DF can grow in suprisingly small containers, about what you'd need for a large houseplant.  If you are in a high humidity area, your DF will do just fine in full sun.  In drier areas, partial shade is better as harsh noon-day sunlight may be too strong for it.<br /><br />--+Getting Fruit+--<br />Dragonfruit will only flower and produce fruit when the overall mass of the plant reaches roughly 10 pounds.  Depending on growing conditions and the size of your initial cutting this could take as little as 6 months, or up to two years. When it does get big enough, large white flowers will begin to bud.  These flower buds can reach 7-8"" in length before opening, and will only open at night.  To add additional insult, most varieties will only flower for a single night, so be prepared.  Luckily, they tend to flower during a full moon, so thats when you should watch the closest.  Some strains are self pollinating, some are not, and this listing does not specify which type we are getting.  Normally pollinated by bats and large moths, you may have to hand pollinate.  Make sure you take the pollen from one flower and apply it to a different one, as not all breeds are self fertile (but are fertile between flowers on the same plant).  If you're lucky enough to get fruit to set, it will take about a month for it to be ready to harvest.  Let the fruit ripen on the stalk until the scaley ""leaves"" covering it start to shrivel.  Harvesting too early means a blander fruit.<br /><br />--+Harvesting Seeds+--<br />Dragonfruit are considered heirloom plants, as they can be grown from seed. To produce the best seeds, you'll need to sacrifice one of the fruits by letting it over-rippen.  Leave it on the stalk as long as possible, then let it sit for a while longer on the shelf until its almost started going bad.  Then slice open and use a very fine strainer to extract the seeds from the fleshy pulp.  Make sure you get all of the flesh off the seeds before drying, as rotting pulp can infect the seed with various diseases.  Dry normaly (place on newspaper or paper towel and place in window sill for a week or two), and store in a small paper envelope.  Just be careful, as the seeds are exceedingly small, so watch out that you don't sneeze while preparing them. =)<br /><br />--+Making Cuttings+--<br />Dragonfruit grows exceptionally easily from cuttings.  Even easier than tomatoes.  Make a cutting at least 8-9"" long with a sterilized knife, preferrably at one of the natural branches (where one stalk ends and a new offshoot starts growing from it's end).  If that isn't an option, cuttings can still easily be made from the middle of the stalk, just let it sit out in the air (and out of the sun) for a few days for the cut end to scab over.  After that, its just a matter of sticking the base end of the cutting several inches into the soil.  DF cuttings have even been known to start rooting themselves while laying on tables with no water or soil at all, so it really is quite difficult to go wrong with one.  Please note that the cutting will not have any visible above ground growth until it has rooted itself sufficiently.  As long as your cutting is not wilting and shriveling up, its doing fine, just let it be.  And if you end up forgetting which end of your cutting is the base and which end is the top (easy to do if you end up with one stalk cut into 3, that middle piece won't have an obvious top or bottom), just remember that the spines always point up.<br /><br />Odds are that you'll be making cuttings for everyone you know, as DF can grow pretty wild looking and require pruning to keep it from taking over, and all those pruned branches are easily rootable into new plants.  If nothing else, every time you prune it back, chop it into foot long segments and put them on ebay for $5 each. ;)",5
really disappointment since the way they arrived was horrible<br /> i was trying reach them since couple of days no response<br />i recommend not to go ahead with this product..,1
"My cats gobble these up...they love this treat!  I just wish the morsels were a little larger so they would chew them!  They like them so much that they just swallow them whole!  I give them 4 stars due to the size, since they don't chew them, it doesn't help prevent tartar on their teeth....",4
My grandmother's cats are so overweight.  Tried to find a good product that would be healthy for them and slim them down a bit.  This product seems to be going over (with some adjustment time) well with the 3 kitties.  Mixing in a little wet food to get them used to it helps. Will keep buying for her.,4
This product is very good and very comparable to Enfamil Lipil.  The only problem my daughter has had is some constipation with this formula.,4
"What a croc!  The picture indicated what i wanted, 8 half gallon sized coconut milks in the red containers.  That is NOT what i received.  I got 8 SMALL 6.5 ounce containers.  This is outrageous.  Don't order.  This price is way too high for what is received!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"Living in Florida near the water resulted in lots of shrimp in the freezer last fall. We enjoy our fried shrimp lightly coated, and this cracker meal is one of the best. Tried store after store then looked on line and ordered a case from Amazon delivered right to my door. Shared some with my mother and stored the extra boxes in the freezer. Save gas,Shop on line!",5
"I ordered this product knowing that my cat loves Newman's Organic Turkey formula.  However, he refuses to eat it, and I am concerned that there is something wrong with this batch. I have offered it to him over a several week period thinking he would change his mind, but no luck.  I usualy have good luck ordering from Amazon, but this time I am totally frustrated not being able to speak to anyone.  I would donate the case to an animal shelter, but I am afraid that it could hurt the animals.  You see....I unknowingly fed another pet bad canned food a number of years ago, and there was eventually a recall.  Later she had health problems, and I believe it damaged her kidneys.  It was, in fact, a high quality pet food, so one never knows.",1
"This wasn't the best, but it was alright. I will not buy this product again!",1
"The product is a good value for the amount you get, however it is way too salty.  The product is very dry and firm.  I think this would be good if they cut the salt content in half.",2
"I tought it would be healthy and an Easter treat for my grandkids.  I was not either one. If you are looking for a healthy snack, not this.",1
Bad taste does not work well keurig coffee maker comes in tea bag does not brew consistently sometimes strong sometimes weak,1
"Definitely a moister, kippered-style jerky.  Not the ultra dry kind that makes your teeth hurt.  I can see why some might find it too ""oily"", as I have found brands like that before.<br /><br />But it definitely works here, at least with the Sweet and Hot.  I haven't tried the other flavors.<br /><br />And it's not too sweet or too hot.  Kinda like a Chinese spare rib, without the bone.  I'd buy more.",4
I am a big fan of Newman's Own products including their cookies but these were hard and had a very strong spicy ginger flavor.  It seemed as if some of the cookies were stale becuase they were so hard.  The ginger flavor is very pronounced and ginger lovers will enjoy these but it was overwhelming to me.  I threw out half the bag because every other cookie seemed to be stale/rock hard.,2
"Fast delivery, but to me Sopressata tasted a little bitter. Actuall weight of Sopressata is under 1.5 LB (2 LB is parcel weight).",3
"This is my daughter's  most favorite baby food by far.  This is the only ones she'll eat and rarely will eat the other kinds.  However, the taste is very bland, for me as an adult at least. After you put the unfinished portion in the fridge, it may become sort of watery at which point I throw it out. It is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has, especially zucchini.<br />I had to update my review today, because I saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food.  PLASTIC IN BABY FOOD? I notified Earth's Best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing, but I am not giving my baby this food any more, even though she likes it, that's it for us.",1
"Bought for gin & tonics. Was really excited that it used cane sugar, came in a can, and came in an 8oz size.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the proof is in the pudding, not the package. Hansen's is just too sweet. I suppose some of this is up to personal taste, but I nearly felt a film on my teeth after drinking it, and all of the gin flavors were overpowered by the sweetness and the citrus component. Granted, I was using New Amsterdam, which is itself citrusy, but the sweetness would have overpowered even a more neutral gin.<br /><br />Skip.",2
"I found these to be tough and not very tasty.  I would recommend Sunsweet dried apricots instead, which are softer and juicier.  Also, I also recommend refrigerating them, as they are much better chilled.  These are still edible, but more so as a topping rather than by themselves as a snack.",2
"Calm is one of those products you must research before buying and using.  If you use it for calming effect, I have not realized it.  I have been using as a laxative, it is magnesium citrate after all.  It works as a an intestinal irritant and one should be aware of its side effects.  Again, do your own research before using.",4
The crackers I received were stale. Luckily Amazon refunded my order. Also you might be able to find a better deal in stores.,2
The packaging is really cute but the brownies weren't that spectacular.  I'm always on the lookout for wonderful brownies and had a special offer for these.  Very disappointed in that they were dry and had no flavor.  I wouldn't recommend them.  Buy a box of Ghiradelli mix and make them yourself; much richer chocolate flavor.,2
"I don't know anyone who has purchased a Keurig single serving unit for the specific purpose of making hot chocolate.  If that's what you're most interested, save your money and get a hot water kettle for a heck of a lot less plus a good hot chocolate mix recipe (that perhap used dried milk).  So, in reviewing the Green Mountain Coffee Hot Chocolate k cups, you have to sort of start here - is this about convenience or taste?<br /><br />As far as convenience goes, there's no question it's pretty gosh darn convenient.  Toss a k-cup into the slot and hit brew - there you go.  A+ for speed.  Congratulations, you can make hot chocolate in less time than it takes to boil water.  I suppose if having a hot cup of cocoa is what you absolutely must have in 30 seconds or less, you lead a very wonderful life and I'd like to experience it once myself.  You know, the world where instant hot chocolate is the biggest worry of the day.  Truth be told, though, when entertaining, it's nice to have the option of a single serving - quickly - without the need for a secondary device or even a microwave which can superheat the water.<br /><br />Kids can use the device, so that's another plus.  Properly trained, a young child can make their own hot chocolate without too much risk of 3rd degree burns.  So the question then turns to taste....<br /><br />Our 7 year old and 5 year old were used in the taste test.  We served them hot choclate from a packet (swiss miss, with marshmallows), a single cup of the Green Mountain, and a cup of a family recipe we have that also uses water.  (They added marshmallows to the other two options as well).<br /><br />Family recipe won by a landslide.  Two to nothing.  Swiss miss was made, per the packet directions, with 8 ounces of water.  They liked this second best, but still complained of it being watery.  The Green Mountain came in third, because it was entirely too watery.<br /><br />I remade the Swiss Miss and the Green Mountain version with less water.  I used the next smalles setting on the Keurig and I only used 6 ounces of water on Swiss Miss.  Green Mountain was the lesser preferred, although the it wasn't so much about the ""wateryness"" as the actual flavor.<br /><br />My kids tend to like the creamier - which is largely milk based - hot chocolate.  Green Mountain just didn't provide that.<br /><br />I think with less water, the Green Mountain k-cup tastes fairly good.  No, it's not very creamy.  But for a quick single serving, it will do.  Then again, we didn't get a Keurig in order to make hot chocolate in the firt place, so I can't get too undone about the mediocrity of this flavor.  It's ok.  Not worth a higher recommendation, and certainly not worth the purchase of the machine.  But it's a nice flavor to add to the ensemble of other flavors.",3
"I give it 4/5, losing one star for decreasing the ounces during the recession. An old trick, but still reliable, I guess.",4
"I give this milk to my son...we are experimenting with different milks.<br /><br />The pros- the boy seems to really enjoy his goat's milk and doesn't seem to know the difference between the kind we get in the refrigerated section of our grocery store and the powdered variety.  It's nice for those emergencies when your local grocery runs out of those few quarts of goat's milk it carries.  It was also good for traveling to grandma's and not wanting to take a cooler to store the milk.<br /><br />The cons- it mixes very clumpy unless you use really warm water to mix it.  Even then you have to stir, stir, stir to get the lumps out. Also, once you open it, it has a limited shelf life, must be because of all of the fat...if your intent was to open it up and use every once in awhile until it runs out, this product is not for you.",4
"I've been trying to give up both Aspartame and High-Fructose Corn Syrup, so I was excited to find Zevia at my local grocery store. I've had stevia one other time, in coffee, and it seemed a little over-sweet, but nothing that couldn't be fixed by using a little less of it. I couldn't even finish a can of this soda though. Not only did it have the worst stevia flavor (grossly sweet and somewhat bitter), but the flavor also tasted really watered down to me. I think the Ginger Root Beer flavor could be really good if it was sweetened with something else and the non-stevia flavors came through a bit stronger. I'm glad I only got a six-pack of this rather than buying the 24 through Amazon as I've considered doing before.",1
"These candies are terrible.  They are supposed to be watermelon flavored, but taste like canteloup.  They are stale and syrupy-tasting, without any tartness.",1
"Unless you are already familiar with working with sourdough and know what you are doing (which I didn't), you need to be very patient and experiment with this product.  I have now been working with the starter for about a month and I am still trying to get a loaf of sourdough bread similar to an 'artisian bread' from the market.  I have tried a variety of receipies; those provide and from the internet.  The sourdough flavor varies greatly with the receipe.  The flavor has developed and the starter become more active the longer I have worked with it.  This morning I found my overnight rise spilling over into the (cool) oven where I had it rising.  I had no idea how long it took to make a loaf of sourdough bread; almost 16 hour using the provided receipe.  It did produce an excellent batch of sourdough pancakes, but still a long process.  Keep trying!<br /><br />The product says free shipping, but for some reason I paid more for shipping ($4.49) than I did for the starter ($2.99).  The product arrived in a standard business envelope with about two ounces of dry starter.  I used about half (as per instructions) to create my starter.  The instructions are primative and poorly formatted for use in the kicthen.  The ad says you get a 12 page booklet, I got 3 - 8.5 X 11 single sided pages.  And the instructions do not provide an email address for the ""free unlimited tech support.""  I found the same basic bread receipe on epicurious.com which is much easier to read and follow.  You can also find receipies for starter on the internet.  However, I am hoping that this one will produce something more like the authentic San Franciso sourdough as advertised.<br /><br />So 3 Stars.  It would be 4 but for the shipping cost and instructions, and perhaps 5 when I figure out what I am doing.",3
"Like other reviewers have said, these are a little salty, but if you have your snack with a drink, the saltiness isn't so bothersome.  Otherwise, they have an AMAZING flavor and provide a satisfying crunch.  Also, it's a good source of calcium if don't drink milk.",4
"I've been enjoying Jet Fuel for 18 months now - and mostly enjoy the other flavors from the Coffee People - but in the last 2 weeks the prices have skyrocketd (up $5 a box), and most of these are no longer available for subscribe and save (another $3-4 increase).  Gives me a pause to whether this k-cup thing is even worth it.  The good cups went from 35 cents a cup or so, to now over 50 CENTS!",1
"I've had the White Cheddar Kernel Seasoning and it was fantastic. So, I was surprised how terrible this ""flavor"" was. Not like the tangy barbecue chip taste I was anticipating. More like sickly sweet. Not good.",1
"I was initially disappointed on opening the package because the packages are so tiny.  Then I was more disappointed because they are less than half full.  There were maybe 20 small cheese straws in each package.  A four pack of Paula Deen has about the same amount of cheese straws as a single package of Geraldine's (the best packaged cheese straws, in my opinion, which sell for less than $5 a package).<br />But I suppose it's not a terrible thing that there are so few cheese straws because these taste terrible.  They use oil instead of butter, and I think that's the primary problem.  They're greasy instead of rich. They are also not nearly cheesy enough somehow.  Very disappointing on the whole.",1
I love this coffee syrup. I have tried others and nothing tastes as good as this one!  Great flavor and alot of syrup for the money!,5
"I'm not sure it's much cheaper than the movie theater, but it is comparable in taste. I use this with my stir crazy popper.<br /><br />It's a lot of popcorn, but perfect for a crowd.<br /><br />Best popcorn I've popped myself.",4
Have only tried about 3 of the flavored coffees thus far and not impressed at all...  The coffees are weak and lack the flavor that they should have such as the Cinnamon Roll coffee - coffee was very weak and cinnamon roll flavor non-existent.

Be good to the environment and save on packaging. The multigrain flakes are not as tasty as other Nature's Patch cereals. I enjoy the Millet flakes more than the Multigrain - The Multigrain flakes are quite comparable to Heritage flakes.,4
"I saw a youtube video recommending this product, so I gave it a whirl. I actually bought the single box not the ten pack and I would recommend you do the same if you want to try this stuff. What you get in each box is two blocks of something like chocolate in individually sealed packs with instructions on the back for using both at once. My biggest complaint with the product is that it was not hot at all in fact the predominant flavor was MSG. There _was_ a complex undertone that might have been pleasant had not the blaring MSG main note been so overpowering. I wound up throwing away most of it after staring down the leftovers in the fridge for a week.",2

"Great for light to moderate chewers but if you have a serious chomper save the money and trouble picking up the pieces.  My dogs love these, but must be watched closely so the heavy chomper doesn't steal it and destroy it.  I wish he understood that he used to have one, but he ruined it.  I bet a Border Collie would have figured that out, but then again, a Border Collie would have logged on and bought another.",3

"I would not consider myself an expert on coffee, but I did not care for this flavor.  It seemed quite bitter, and did not have the same flavor as the Italian roasts I have had before.  I used to get coffee pods, and one of my favorites was the Italian roast.  I have since switched to whole beans that I grind myself, but I was disappointed when I tried this one.  It did not have the same flavor I was used to in an Italian roast.  It is possible that the ones I had before were the ones that were not true Italian roasts, but this coffee just seemed bitter, and without any real flavor to it.  I did use the entire bag, but it is not something I will order again.  This is the second bag I have ordered from Coffee Bean Direct, and I am hesitant to try another flavor, because I was not impressed with that one either.  Maybe I just ordered two bad bags, but both of the bags I received seemed over-roasted and bitter.",2

"I have used these bags for the past 6 months. I used to love them and liked that they are biodegradable, but the last box I bought contained a lot of damaged bags. I thought it was one bad batch, but it keeps happening with bags from different batches. I have lost over 30 ounces of breast milk in the past month and one day didn't have the regular amount to send with my son to daycare. Breastfeeding mamas know the devastation of losing even an ounce can cause so losing this much has been beyond upsetting.  I caution you to be very careful when using these bags for milk storage.",2
"I want to address a very undervalued and perhaps subjective requirement of a meal replacement powder, and that is 'taste'.  This product smells like pumpkin... bad pumpkin (surprisingly it has no pumpkin in it?).  It tastes like the soggy end of a bad pumpkin, and that's the chocolate version.  I love Spirutein chocolate drink, and this is not that, but I was looking for a meal replacement/diet aid.  I am not a vegan, and I mixed it with whole milk anticipating the flavor to be less than sublime, but even the milk did not help.  I surmise that this product is solely developed for vegans, as they tend to accept 'nasty' as a daily dietary requirement.  I shall endeavor to persevere with this product until the bottle is empty.  Perhaps I should mix it with Spirutein?  I think I'll go have some tea to help wash out the taste.<br /><br />October 9th 2012 Update ~<br />Well, I believe I have figured out how to make this product work.  I mixed one scoop of Raw Meal chocolate with 1 cup of whole milk and 1 cup of chocolate almond milk (I believe the flavor of the almond milk masks the product more than just milk).  I also added a banana and some frozen peach and blended.  I think the bare minimum for flavor tolerance is the chocolate almond milk.  That way you get the benefit of the raw meal, without having to gag.  It is a filling substitute, as I can go all day with just having the shake for breakfast and lunch, with fruit and veggies as a snack... and then a normal dinner... which is what makes me want to continue to use the product, because other diets leave one feeling starved!  It is also reasonably priced for what you get, which is overall a very high quality product (if the information on the packaging is true).",3
"After looking everywhere for these cookies/wafers, I finally found them on Amazon.com. I was bummed that the smallest quantity I could order was 12 boxes, partly because I was concerned about the risk of the cookies being damaged in shipping; I couldn't bear the thought of spending that much money on cookies that ended up broken. As things turned out, I was needlessly worried: I've opened 4 of the 12 boxes so far, and they all arrived in good shape.",5

"Rich and smoky. This is a good French Roast. The packaging allows you the fragrance of the ground coffee, which you don't get with standard K-cups. A box of 36 comprises three sealed plastic bags of twelve cups each. They are not resealable, so after I open a bag, I put it into a plastic storage container to preserve freshness. San Francisco Bay Coffee's K-cups will remind you of what it used to be like to open a coffee can. If you miss the rich coffee smell, but you don't use a basket accessory or one of the reusable K-cup accessories to hold your choice of loose ground coffee, consider giving this a try.",4
"When we received these, I opened the package and instantly had several of our 5 cats standing at attention waiting to test out the newest smackeral.

"Am I the only idiot in the world who cannot remove the metal lid without making a huge mess?  I normally end up wearing part of the soup, which I guess makes my meal even lower calorie.<br /><br />Other than that, the soup is pretty decent.  As with most low calorie soups, it's mostly broth with a few vegetables thrown in.  It's not loaded with corn syrup, and water is listed twice in the first seven ingredients.  It's filling, but the entire bowl counts as two servings.  Yeah right.  I barely eat anything, and not even I am buying that.  Still, 100 calorie lunch is not bad.<br /><br />To avoid the lid ordeal, buy yourself a thermos and fill it with soup.  You can get two to three real lunch servings per can, save some money and not smell like soup for half of your workday.  If you ask me, that's a win!",3
"This product was just okay for me.  It's another sugar-packed cereal product with no uniqueness other than the fact that they are littler versions of Nabisco's Shredded Wheat Minis. I don't like cereals that get soggy quickly and this one does.  In general I believe that almost all commercial boxed cereal products are WAY,WAY,WAY over priced, and their sugar-packed content negates any nutritional benefit for an increasingly obese nation. Oh, did I mention that they are WAY over priced? I don't recommend this product.",2
These should be available on auto-delivery because my 2 bichons literally fight over them every night! They seem to be easily digested and keeps them busy for quite awhile.,5
These reviews are wrong.It may work but I could not swallow this disgusting swill. I have many Teas. Let me describe this one. Get compost from a gardening store and brew that in a french press. The burnt leaf taste is pungent. Take the pills and buy some earl grey.,1
"This bar was a little to dry and too hard, not to mention on the bland tasting side too.",2
"Perfect blend of spices with just a bit of oil to keep them firm yet dry. Perfect for salads, salsa, even a Martini. Too bad they never made it to a dish, so good just eat em right out of the pouch :)<br /><br />A side note, these olives would be great served on airplanes, they keep and they have a good design. They would also be great to take along hiking.<br /><br />Best  Wishes,<br />  E.A.C",5
Light in flavor but still very good. If your trying to stay away from the ramen soup loaded with so much sodium then this is your answer. The noodles are thin rice noodles and on the package it says these are good for those on a vegan diet. I do add a small finely chopped mushroom or some sort of small piece of veggie and it's very filling.,5
"While working in the Middle East and being at the mercy of the DFACs, I decided that the lack of good, fresh vegetables was hampering my ability to get the daily fiber that I needed.  Plus, they help settle my stomach during the frequent cases of, shall we say, food borne upset stomachs.  The taste pretty decent and help keep me full when I'm not inclined to go to the chow hall so...can't really complain.",4
"This was my first time purchasing the Garvey's Organic Pancake mix and it was great.  Supporting local companies is a great thing and the size of the package was just right for my family.  Not one pancake was left over from breakfast, outstanding product.",5

While staying in Bamburg Germany my family and I enjoyed the athentic version of Mushroom sauce and potato dumplings for lunch.  Such fond memories of delishious foods.  This is soooo good!,5
"""Organic"" means that something in there was/might be organic.  This claims to be 100% organic.  USDA organic does not mean much any more.  I'm not sure what NDA is.<br /><br />Mine has an expiration date of 11/22/13.  It does not have a picked date. I wish it did.  Normal teas are best no more than a year from the picking date.  I have no idea how long it has been sitting around.<br /><br />It says it is pure leaves but there seems to be some white sticks in the mix.  And it is a mix.  Not many leaves - unlike the picture- more of a crunch.  I have to use my finest filter and some still goes through.  I don't use paper.<br /><br />A pound is a lot of tea.<br /><br />I mix it with my green tea in the am and it keeps me from getting jittery.  Tastes like Tulsi to me but... the real, fresh leaf is very fine indeed.<br /><br />And where is it from?  US, India? Belize?",3

"I've enjoyed these anise pastilles for many years.  Just 3 ingredients, none of them artificial.  If you like anise flavor or like licorice you'll probably love these.  Everyone I've ever given them to loves them too.  Intense but not harsh, refreshing flavor.  Size and shape of tic tacs, but so much better!  I order them by the case to keep on hand.  The tin is lovely too.  Too good to be called breath mints, they are really a wonderful convection.",5

"Like a few other reviewer here, I noticed right away after opening the bag (Cinnamon Oat Clusters) that it smelled like stale grains or stale peanuts. It's a pretty strong odor but it wasn't overpowering.<br /><br />Since I am not familiar with some of the grains in the bag, I thought maybe they have some distinct odors that are similar to what I assume is a stale smell. For reference, I know the smell of flax seed, oats, and rice, and they smell nothing like what I was smelling from this bag.  Despite the strange smell, I still tried a few bites, and the taste wasn't too bad but I KNOW it would have been better without that lingering smell.<br /><br />Just like the others who have complained, the expiration date on my bag is August 29, 2012, so the product should have still been good.<br /><br />Also, like others, I felt that there really weren't many clusters as the picture on the product shows. The lack of larger clusters makes it harder to be a hand snack but you can still pour it in a cereal bowl and add milk.<br /><br />Previously I have enjoyed Kind products, so this experience won't prevent me from trying other Kind products. However, I may be hesitant to try this particular product again. I'll be glad to change my review though if Kind sends me another bag -- and it doesn't have that peculiar smell.",2
The taste and texture are just awful.  These are way too sweet and no one in my family will touch them.  Worse than an over ripe banana taste.  I would give more accurate description but I don't want to taste it again bc they are just that gross.,1
I got this for Father's day and my dad loved it and did not mention one thing about it being small or anything. This really made his day so I am pleased with the idea to order the gift for him. I would recommend it!,3

"I was starving after coming back from my workout, so I wanted something quick and healthy for my lunch. This pasta meal did the trick. It cooks up in one minute and was easily prepared by mixing the sauce tray with the pasta. The sauce made this dish. It was very flavorful and not overly salty. The pasta was served al dente. The portion was actually about right for a lunch item. The other thing I like is that it is not a frozen food item, which is great for those that don't have a refrigerator/freezer available at work to store it.<br /><br />The only downside is the high amount of carbs, which can be expected from pasta. The Amazon pricing is competitive with other meals of this sort, at roughly $3 carton. If you use Amazon's subscribe and save, and the $5 e-coupon, it is definitely a bargain and must have for that last minute lunch.",4
"I'm not a big fan of pepper and found these a bit too spicy for my personal taste.  But, while I wasn't crazy about these, my 7yo dd, who is a spice fiend (loves pepper), LOVED these, as did my husband.  They both ended up taking the can over to my neighbor, who had to try them, and he told his wife to buy them, as he too now is addicted.  She already purchased 2 cans for him.  While I will be purchasing them again, they won't be for myself though.",3
"I heard this product worked miracles and it has proven it to me!  Our Yellow Lab didn't shed that badly but we noticed we had to dust a little more, well, alot more with her in our home, a friend who has 4 Labs told us about this and he said it cut the hair problem by 3/4! and for us at least, it has done that!!  And she loves the taste!  We also give it to our Cocker Spaniel and it has given him a nice shinny coat!  It's vitamins andn minerals so it's not bad for them!  We highly recommend it to everyone we know who has a dog that sheds!<br />At least try it for a couple of weeks and see!  I think you'll be amazed as we were!<br />rachel",5
"The new box says ""NEW LOOK! same great taste!"" and that is a patent lie.<br /><br />I have been drinking this tea for over 10 years.  The previous reviewer is right - the tea is different now.  I had some of the original/previous tea and then I got a big order of the new tea, and I tried them side by side.  They are similar, but the new stuff (in the dark purple box) is more overpowering and I actually disliked whatever new ingredient they added.  It was so terrible to smell and it also affected the taste of the tea.  I drank one glass and it was truly awful; I won't be drinking another.  So sad.<br /><br />This really ticks me off because the product has been perfect and consistent for the last 10+ years.  I noticed that there are fewer tea leaves in the individual bags as well (this was obvious to the naked eye, comparing with the previous tea bags), so it's not as potent as the original.  The old tea bags used to be generous in terms of how much tea was in each bag, and it made a perfect cup of tea.  The new ones are skimpy and one tea bag will not be enough.  That being said, the new flavor is so bad (to me) that I am going to have to give away the 6 boxes.",2
"A nice tasty alternative to soda. Its just fruit juice with carbonation added. Here are the specs:<br /><br />Calories: 120;<br />Fat: 0;<br />Sodium 15mg;<br />Total Carbohydrates 31g;<br />Sugar 24g;<br />Protein 0g;<br />Vitamin C 100%<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, Apple, Grape, Cherry juice concentrates), natural flavor and color, citric acid, ascorbic acid (vitamin C)<br /><br />One thing I love NOT seeing on the label is HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP. That alone makes it a wonderful beverage to have as an alternative to soda. My kids liked it too. Does pack a bunch of calories but as it is intended to replace syrupy carbonated beverages I guess you have to trade off something with a compromise.<br /><br />The can is more like a redbull can and not a traditional soda can.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.",4
"My cats enjoy this product well enough - they actually eat less of this than they ate of their old food and seem satisfied. I like that it's grain free and made with what seems like good ingredients. But I will say this - the litterbox odor has gotten ridiculous since I started feeding this food. I've never smelled anything like it. I now have to scoop at least twice a day, every day, or it's unbearable. Their, uh, output has increased significantly. If you live in a small residence, be forewarned!",3

"This is a great value on some very unique gummi bears. Some are very flavorful and will definitely leave you wanting more.

The good flavors are some of the best I've ever tasted though!",4
"The Ingredients aren't from Nantucket, the blend is not smooth. Too heavy  or something maybe too much arabica.<br /><br />then today I learn Green Mountain Coffee is involved with this:<br />Burlington, Vermont - October 25, 2010<br /><br />Could a routine inquiry into accounting practices at Green Mountain Coffee Roasters lead to an insider trading investigation? A Wall Street whistleblower believes it's possible after reviewing documents from the Securities Exchange Commission.<br /><br />The SEC is already conducting an informal inquiry into Green Mountain's ""revenue recognition practices."" And now Sam Antar, a securities expert who has worked with federal investigators, says public documents show a company executive sold thousands of shares just before the company publicly disclosed the SEC inquiry. The announcement of the inquiry was followed by a 16-percent drop in Green Mountain's stock price.<br /><br />A group of shareholders are already suing the company, alleging executives artificially inflated the stock price and cashed in before the price drop. And Antar says the timing of the stock sale is the kind of thing that could trigger an insider trading investigation.<br /><br />Not recommending this at all. Try the Donut Shop Kuerig Coffee its a lot better blend..",2
"Our 12+ yr old lab has been a finnicky eater for the past few years.  I've tried anything and everything to get her to eat. This food was new at our grocery store and I thought I'd give it a try.  She loves it!!!  This is the first 'dry'  dog food she eats without any extras ( fruit, veggies, meats etc)  Yesterday, the first day, she ate approx 4 cups of this food, typically she doesn't eat that much.  Well, let's see if that was a fluke, this morning she ate another 2 cups.  This food isn't really dry, it's a bit moist.  It smells great.  I can't believe our dog is eating it, much less so much of it.  I plan on getting the larger size bag from Amazon and trying some of the treats.",5
"Thank you for the product. I love the taste, and it helps my sore throat and prevents from catching cold.",5
This price of over 20 dollars is too expensive for a 72 oz bag. You can get the same at Sam's club for $11.,1
"I really do not know what the issue is with this goat milk. My one year old daughter has suffered horrible constipation since switching to cow milk on her birthday. After a month of us both suffering (because I had to help it along if you get my drift), I switched her to goat milk. After 2 days, she was passing perfectly soft stools. The goat milk definitely cured her of the constipation, but each can I open seems to be different. Sometimes when I reconsitute it, I know right away that it is going to taste terrible because the smell is so strong. Other cans, I hardly notice it. She will not drink the bad-smelling milk, and when I have tried it, I have nearly vomitted! Majorly salty and gamey tasting.<br />Compared to fresh (Meyenberg from the fridge section of grocery store), well, it really doesn't compare. I have found the fresh to taste sweet, like cream, and then there is a little gamey after-taste, but nothing like the slap-you-in-the-face taste of the powdered. I was hoping to save money with the powdered, but since it is a 50/50 chance she won't drink certain cans, I am really wasting money. I am thinking I will have to stick with the fresh from now on.<br />If anyone has any ideas about what the difference between cans could be, I would love to hear it! I always have prepared it with Britta-filtered water (warmed on the stove) and mixed it up in pyrex, then stored it in a large Ball jar in fridge. (I know I should prob call the company and talk to them, but that would require me to actually remember to do it at a time that they are open and I am able - never happens!!)Thanks!",3
"I won't dispute the fact that Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin is somewhat expensive and may not be the healthiest choice in dry dog food, but there is no denying the fact that dogs love it. Heck, I have 2 cats and even they enjoy snacking on it when the dog isn't around. Perhaps it isn't ideal nutrition, but I don't think it is as bad as some other reviewers have made it out to be. In any event, this is more of a treat food than a diet staple, and when viewed in that light, it is actually healthier and much more cost effective than many of those little packages of doggie treats that line the grocery store shelves.<br /><br />Place a serving of this next to a bowl of ""healthy"" store brand dog food and there is no comparison. Aesthetically it looks better, but I know that isn't what dogs care about. The bowl of Chef Michael's food will be eaten first every time. My suggestion is to either mix it in with your regular dry food, or use it as a treat. If you are overly concerned by the ingredients in your pet's food, then you may find issue with this brand. Also, there is no ""zip-lock"" to re-seal it so you'll need a large, strong clip to keep the bag closed. Or you can use an large plastic container like I do. Otherwise, this pet food gets two paws up!",4
"Unlike most Stash teas, and most premium loose teas in general, this tea is not identified by a region of origin or a method of preparation.  Fittingly, the flavor is very typical of unadulterated green tea.  Before infusion, the dry leaves smell of sweet hay, but after brewing, the smell and the flavor is a bit more mild and earthy.  There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a ""premium"" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don't expect anything outstanding.",3
"My toddler daughter loves these packets. My only complaint is that the cap is a choking hazard, because it is so small. I love being able to offer her a snack that is made from real fruit and not overly sugared. We keep a few in her diaper bag with us at all times.",4

"I tried to like this tea being that I bought a whole box, but I am still working on it going 4 months now. I drink at least one cup of tea at work everyday and I am partial to mint in my tea. However, there is little to no tea or mint flavor going on here. I have shared this with many people at work and it isn't just me.<br /><br />There are particles left behind in the tea bag with more aroma than the brewed tea itself. I always leave the bag in the cup as I drink it and it never gets stronger. There is nothing satisfying about it, I might as well just drink hot water.<br /><br />I do like stash teas but don't make my mistake, try it first. The packages I received are different than pictured now, maybe it has improved. I am disappointed.",2
The pudding wasn't authentic tasting. I believe they didn't add enough dates. The toffee sauce was thin and watery. Not as good as Sticky Toffee Pudding Company puddings.,1
"I absolutely love the Mi-Del ginger snaps, so I thought I'd try these in vanilla, thinking they'd be just as tasty.  Unfortunately, they didn't have the vanilla flavor I'd hoped for, and I wasn't crazy about their consistency.  They almost seemed stale, although I'm sure that's not the case.  As I actually prefer the name brand vanilla snaps, I gave these away to my local food pantry.",2
I placed an order with Amazon and was orginally sent the wrong flavored product-I received the banana cinnamon<br />snacks.  I let Amazon know and without any hesitation they sent me the purple pack without any charge.<br />I enjoyed both flavors and love the crunch.  Great for traveling.,3
"On a scale of 0 to 10:<br /><br />Health: 7 - The main ingredient is the standard flour, followed then by the 7 whole grains, so this can't be considered a true whole grain cracker.  The positives are that there are no hydrogenated oils and the limited sweetener is evaporated cane juice.<br /><br />Taste: 9 - Excellent taste<br /><br />Price: 4 - If you can find this for $2, it's a bargain.  Generally, it's closer to $3, which is a little high for a 9 OZ box of crackers.",4
"I really wanted to like this product, but it doesn't taste like much.  The organic cocoa powder doesn't seem to mix well, and the hemp...well, it's hemp, got a funny taste to it -- though nowhere near as intense and malodorous as that emanating from the company's Hemp Pro 70 line!  Anywhere, this one is okay.  If you want a plant-based protein from what seems to be a ""progressive"" company, this is probably the way to go.  Just understand that the taste is at best tolerable, even with cocoa powder and sugar among the ingredients!  That's how awful hemp tastes....",3
"These pellets are the EXACT same as ""equine (horse) bedding"", and similar to wood pellets for pellet stoves. You can buy a 40  (yes, forty!) pound bag of equine pellet bedding for only $6!!! (vs $10 for 20 pounds of Feline Pine!) I purchase at my local farm/tractor store. Wood stove pellets are even less - can get 40 pounds as cheap as $4.  I called the manufacture of one wood pellet stove product and they told me it is totally safe for pets...no chemicals used in production, and made from PINE, etc. However, some wood pellet stove are made from hardwoods (not pine) and this would not be as absorbent so you need to double check on the type of wood stove pellets. I'd stick with equine bedding...it is pine and made for animals.<br /><br />I do love this type of litter! No dust. Absorbs and masks odor better than any other litter. After using this type of litter for a couple years, I am pretty ""skilled"" at being able to scoop out mostly only the sawdust, and leave the intact pellets behind. My cats usually pee in the corners so that is where most of the sawdust is. Also, if you shake the box, sawdust drops to bottom and you can scrape intact pellets to the side and scoop the sawdust underneath out. If you don't pay attention when you scoop and are not tedious with a ""method"" like me, you will likely also scoop out a lot of the intact pellets too and thus waste a lot of it. We went out of town for 2 weeks, and our cat sitter used DOUBLE the amount of litter we use!<br /><br />For the star rating - I'd actually give 5 stars for this pine pellet type of litter. But I am giving one star because of the ridiculous price charged by Feline Pine!!",1
"I know they had discontinued this item, but every time I would go to the supermarket my bf would look for this, because he lovvvves this stuff. So i did some homework and was glad to find this! Now my bf can rest easy because he has his Reese's peanut butter...at least for a little while.",4
"""The Switch"" seems to be another take on carbonated fruit drinks. It immediately reminded me of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00094JEUO"">Izze</a> line of drinks that I've tried in the past...same size, and same basic idea of just fruit juice and carbonated water. After trying this one sample though, I'd have to say I prefer Izze. The black cherry Switch that I tried had a decent enough flavor (very mild cherry flavor but still pleasant), but it was really sweet, and had even more sugar per can than Izze, which was already pretty high. I think these drinks are a nice alternative to sodas, if you just have to have something with fizz and can't take artificial sweeteners. Definitely a better choice for kids who want something sweet but at least a tad healthier since these are natural sugars with a lower glycemic index. But it's still a simple sugar, and there's a LOT of it in this drink, 33g in 8.3 oz. The price is also pretty hefty, at almost $1 a can. Personally, I think I do just as well getting fruit juice of my choosing and adding some club soda to it for fizz. But when I am in the mood for something sweet to pack for a hike, etc. and just have to have something, I'd probably look for Izze drinks first.",3
Big Franks are the best vegetarian frank that I have ever tried. They taste far better than real meat weiners. They have a somewhat soft texture and could be easily broken down and used in a casserole or some other recipe. They come in a broth that could also be used to add flavor to recipes. I dare anyone to who hates meat analogues to not be pleased with this product. I can't say enough about Big Franks!,5
"The Bad: The taste is a version of 'grape,' that is more like bitter, low-class red wine. Tart in an unpleasant way.<br /><br />It comes in 16-oz cans, with ""two servings"" per can. Since it's carbonated, you either have to drink the whole can over an extended period, save it and hope it doesn't go flat, share it, or drink it fairly quickly like any normal soda - and get a lot of caffeine and sugar in a pretty short time. Drinks like this should come in smaller cans.<br /><br />The Good: It will perk you right up, which is the point.<br /><br />Doesn't give the jitters like some of these drinks tend to. I drank the full can - two servings - but it didn't make my heart palpitate or anything.<br /><br />I drink several cups of coffee a day, and occasionally drink energy drinks like this as well. Despite my caffeine intake, a caffeinated soda like Diet Coke will still keep me up at night. Notably, this drink did NOT keep me up.",3

"True Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee is a culinary treat - this stuff is nothing close. There is a slight woodsy smell to it that is reminiscent of Jamaican blue, but it also reminiscent of wood shavings or possibly just sawdust blended in to my coffee.<br /><br />I was truly disappointed in this coffee - so much so that I ended up grinding it up and adding it to my boyfriend's open Folgers can so that it didn't totally go to waste.  Now, on a positive note, he seemed to like it, but then again, he's never had true Jamaican blue (and he likes Folgers).",1

"I've been buying coconut oil for a long time.  I've always been satisfied with what I got, after all, what can coconut oil be?  Then I tried this one.  It has a light, delicate flavor and a wonderful texture.  I use it in my hair, to shave, on my skin, to fry eggs, to mix with other ingredients.  It adds a nice touch to chocolate cake and goes well with most flavors of cheesecake.  I like this well enough to have a subscription.  First class stuff.",5
"I was hoping to ""sneak"" beets into my sons snack, but there is no hiding with this brand. In fact, the beet flavor is rather overwhelming, and rather on the ""raw"" side. I enjoy beets, pickled and roasted, but this flavor is just not appealing at all. If your kid loves beets (maybe even raw ones?) go for it.  Also, someone commented on it being a runny consistency but my recently ordered batch is on the thick side.",2
"We're a Gluten Free family and love GoPicnic meals.  I like dark chocolate, and like that this chocolate is fair trade, but boy is it bitter!  If you eat it with the applesauce it tones it down, but the wife and young kids have trouble eating it.  I actually make the kids eat their chocolate first to make sure they get it down before eating the other stuff.  It is a hard sell for the little ones, especially when they LOVE getting the Almond Roca in some of the other GoPicnic varieties.<br /><br />We purchased the Tuna & Crackers GoPicnic in a different box design in a grocery store this week, and they had changed the chocolate out to a much less bitter variety by way of a little sea salt.  It is better, but still rough for the kids.  I understand that milk chocolate doesn't fare very well in a warm box, but surely they could add at least a bit of sugar to take the edge off.",4

"When I was a kid I used to get a brand of beef jerky that doesn't exist anymore and I absolutely loved it to death (well, not really to death, but...).  I have tried so many different brands of jerky and have not really found a good substitute to that old brand until a month or so ago I found THIS brand in a small grocery store in the middle of nowhere U.S.A. and bought it on a whim.  I couldn't contain myself because I had FINALLY found a substitute to that old brand, and I just had to get more of it and fast.  So I came online to find it and Amazon.com had it so I ordered a WHOLE case.  It got here in great time and was packaged very well.  I now have a standing order to receive this product every so often and am loving snack time again.<br /><br />This is not the kind of Jerky that makes you feel like you just ripped a hunk of meat off a dead cow, it's been ground up and processed and then made into strips, but that's the kind I LOVE.  Thank you Amazon, and thank you Lowery's!<br /><br />Signed by a VERY satisfied customer.",5

"Just a quick note. This is one of my favorite teas, hands down. It's light and flavorful. I might stick to Earl Grey if I'm working, or want something more ""hearty"", or drinking it with food, but if I want to savor my tea this Darjeeling fits the bill.",5
"I've used this a few times now to make sure I got it right and have to say it's just okay.  My hair is very short and dry so using an oil after I shampoo and condition is a must.  This one left my hair a bit flat and got greasy faster than what I usually use.  One drop is all you need if your hair is short let me tell you otherwise you'll have a grease pit on top of your mellon.  The fragrance is okay, nothing special and not dreadfully gross.  Not my fav but I'd use it anywho.  It might be better to use this after going to the ocean since the salt and sand can really do a number on your hair.  That's my two cents.",3

I was disappointed with this tea.  The taste was no better than Liptons Yellow Label Tea.  I expected more from a Stash loose tea since I have had good expereience with some of their tea bags.,2

"Should have read the reviews on these Haribo Sugarless Gummy Bears before I ordered them. I've always loved the ""Haribo"" brand, and have purchased the regular ones in nearby retail stores. When I saw these sugarless ones on Amazon, I immediately ordered them thinking that since they were sugarless, they would also be less calories. They arrived yesterday, and after consuming only a few I developed severe abdominal pains within a very short period of time. I had a feeling that the cause was from these gummy bears. It wasn't until I finally read the reviews on this item that my suspicions were confirmed. Since there is a ""no return policy"", this bag of Haribo Sugarless Gummy Bears is headed to the trash. Yes, I have learned my lesson, and that is to read the ""reviews"" before I purchase a food item. I hope Amazon will read the reviews for this item, and remove it before any more of their customers suffer from the ""Gummy Bear's Revenge"".",1
"This was blaa, imagine a sponge with a slight coco flavor.  It made a lot but it wasn't quite up to par for cakes.  I liked the idea of the mousse being included so I purchased it.  I won't buy it again.",2
"I tried every possible remedy I could find and nothing gave me consistent results. This product changed my life after 20 years of suffering from IBS-C. I only take one heaping tablespoon a day. I have been using it for about 2 years now and the results are very consistent. I ramped up my dose until I experienced loose stools and then backed off just a little until everything became normal. I am now thinking of breaking it into two smaller doses because the effervescent nature makes me burp like crazy for the first 15 minutes after taking it. But believe me, no matter what, it is worth it. I will most likely take this product for the rest of my life. THANK YOU to the makers.",5
I'm very familiar with this product so no surprises. We use it for several recipes and are glad to be able to get it throught Amazon,5

"This flavor is my second favorite flavor Orgain shake (chocolate is the best!).  But beware if buying from sellers other than Amazon - make sure to check the expiration date when you receive the shakes.  I received a carton that expired within a month of my order date (maybe not a big deal for some, but it takes me at least a couple months to finish a carton of these).",3
"Our three year old German Shepherd suffers from severe food allergies which cause itching, redness, and hair loss. We tried many different types of food, including the most expensive, all natural, and allergen free types on the market. This is the ONLY food he can eat. After two weeks on this food his redness was gone, his hair was growing back, and the itching was practically gone. He has been on this food exclusively now for a year and a half and is doing great! The Amazon price is high, we buy ours at the local farm supply store where it is $26 for a 40 pound bag.<br /><br />If you have a dog with allergies, at least give this food a try. This is a premium food at a bargain price. I have read reviews of many dry dog foods, and this one ranks 92 on a scale of 100 for quality, healthfulness, and safety. For the price, you cannot get any better.",5
"When I ordered the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack, I thought it would be a real treat for the seven cats in our household and that the cats would provide an unbiased and impartial panel of judges. When the package arrived, I gave Brio, our youngest (three years old) one of the Sesame Chicken cans. She gobbled it right down and licked the container clean. Good sign! While she was scarfing down the food, I read the packaging and was impressed with the ingredients and the quality of the food. I was a little disturbed that the food comes from Thailand, but proceeded since I haven't read of any problem pet food coming out of Thailand. When I opened a can of the Chicken Pot Pie, I was amazed that it was mostly gravy - a few bits of chicken and some carrots, but mostly sauce (all of the cans were like that - not just the first one). Charlie (aged 16) liked the sauce but wouldn't touch the solids. For a couple of days, I only put out the Petite Cuisine wet food, and most of it just sat there. Hmmmmmm. With seven cats, you'd think at least one of them would clean it up. One of the claims on the packaging is that there isn't the odor from this food that there is in other brands, and that's very true WHEN THE FOOD IS FRESH. I learned the hard way that it smells just as bad as any other cat food when it's been sitting out for more than a day. My next test was to put out a can of Friskies wet food and a can of Petite Cuisine at feeding time for several days. The Friskies went right down and the Petite Cuisine just sat there. I used the whole case eventually, but have to admit that quite a bit of it went down the toilet. Amazon's case price is a little under $1 per three-ounce can, so that's kind of expensive to have to flush down the drain. My advice would be to not buy several cases of Petite Cuisine initially - see if your cat likes it first. Mine sure weren't impressed!",2
"These Chips were amazing. Best chips I have had in a long time. They are kind of like the sweet bag of dried fruit you normally get to snack on, but these are vegetables. I got the Ala Mexican flavored kind and they are great. However, they are even better with salsa if you want more flavor. Great new chip to try.",4

"I first purchased these cookies at our local health-food store and fell in love with them. They were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside--heaven. I decided to purchase them on Amazon since it was more cost-effective, and I was pretty disappointed with them. They tasted old and crumbly. My advice is find a store that carries them and pay the extra money. It's worth it.",3
Love this and so much less expensive than buying it at my local grocer!  I have ordered at least 3 times and will continue.,5
I have purchased these dog treats in the past and will in the future.  This supplier handles orders in a timely manner.  It always arrives at my home far more quickly than i expect it to.  These toothpicks are great to help keep your dogs teeth clean and white.,5
Save your money and buy Ramen noodles instead.  These have lots of noodles and broth but hardly any flavor.,2
"I love these Barbecue flavored Pop Chips. They're crunchy, loaded with spicy Barbecue flavor, and highly addicting. Beware... you're going to want more! After trying these you'll find it hard to believe they're pretty healthy. Go to their website and see for yourself (not every product page lists ingredients, it's worth checking it out). I'll definitely be buying more of these.<br /><br />4 stars instead of 5 because although they're absolutely delicious, they're also inconsistent. One bag has different textured chips (and coating variances, mainly color difference) from another. That's fine with me but it's just a a little off putting.",4
"I sent this basket as a gift. It was the best thing I could have done, because when the person who received the gift she and her husband was so very please that she was screaming and saying how heavy it was and how very please she was with the appearance of the fruit,cheese and nuts. Also she stated on how great the fruit and cheese and nuts tasted.  They stated that the fruit,cheese and nuts were so fresh and they tried to save it as much as possible but could not stop eating. It was just that good!! I am also please to know it was delivery before time without the box looking like it was broken into.  Thank you once again and please keep up the good works.<br /><br />Wow!!",5
"Lol if you pretend to be a chocolate lover and don't eat raw cacao.

"I've been a Maynard's fan for 30 years and never thought I'd find a better substitute.  I think Gustav's wine gums have better flavor and aren't so sweet.

I use this bar in between training sessions and my meals.  Very low in sugar and the fat comes from the peanuts which is healthy fat.  High in protein and best of all reminds me of my favorite candy bar the Pay day.  Highly reccomend using this supplement in your routine :),5
Ate half of one and threw the other 23 in the garbage. Overwhelming taste/smell as if it had been soaked in sauce. Won't order it again.,1
"Bought these for a reptile party and did not need them all, so was able to sample a package.  There are about 18 snakes per package, each snake is two-tone in clear, bright colors and about 4.5 inches long.  They have two little eyes and a squiggly line up the back.  I expected them to be softer, but found them a little tough and chewy.  They taste great, though and my 8 year old enjoyed them so I suppose that is the truest test!",3

"First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats",2
"I'd give it three and a half stars, couldn't decide between 3 and 4.<br /><br />I use a lot of nutritional yeast, mostly for popcorn flavoring. The taste of this one isn't my favorite. It is a rather strong taste, but I'm glad to have it for variety. Good value for the money.<br /><br />It is a dense powder. Most of them are light and flaky. This means I can keep a lot more in a small container at work.",4
"This is such good stuff, and it's quite healthy. It contains plenty of trace nutrients as well which are vital to our everyday functions, such as eukronium and phosphoric acid. My kids love it! This brand should serve as an example to the rest of this industry.",5
"The good one is a pellet that can be cooked or eaten raw, it tastes like a potato chip.<br /><br />The good one is sold in a 28oz pouch, the one sold in a milk type carton tastes like any other instant potato.<br /><br />I won't make that mistake again!  I threw it out and found the real thing.",1

"I like Stevita products and these are no exception. You don't have to worry about the ingredients, because everything is natural and there are no surprises here. The taste is good, albeit a little weak compared to similar ""Aspartame"" flavored products. However, when you do the math, you are paying approximately 70 cents per packet and this doesn't even include the price of the water.

It's even air tight. This could be the best dog food out there, but if the quality control is bad, I won't be buying it. I'll add pictures of the mold or whatever is growing on the dog food.",1

"I am totally sold on the Orgain nutritional meal replacement drinks.  Creamy Chocolate Fudge is my very favorite but the Vanilla Bean is super also.  They are quick, delicious and very satisfying.  I drink one each day before I leave for work and it keeps me until lunch time.  I often drink another one for lunch.  You never know before you purchase something if it is going to be good but, let me tell you, you will not be disappointed with the Orgain organic meal replacements.  The taste is superior.  They are also a wonderful company to deal with if you have a problem or question.  Thank you Orgain for a wonderful product.  I'll keep drinking them!",5
"I've bought several of this item for gifts for my teenage grandsons, and others. It always goes over well. It's an unusual gift and they all say they really like it. This last order wasn't packed well, so arrived kinda crumbly inside. I'm told it still tasted great.",3
"WE loved this for our dog, at first. Unfortunately after a few uses, his abdomen became distended, he became flatulent (and very stanky, yes STANKY), and had loose stools.

"I tried to like this tea being that I bought a whole box, but I am still working on it going 4 months now. I drink at least one cup of tea at work everyday and I am partial to mint in my tea. However, there is little to no tea or mint flavor going on here. I have shared this with many people at work and it isn't just me.<br /><br />There are particles left behind in the tea bag with more aroma than the brewed tea itself. I always leave the bag in the cup as I drink it and it never gets stronger. There is nothing satisfying about it, I might as well just drink hot water.<br /><br />I do like stash teas but don't make my mistake, try it first. The packages I received are different than pictured now, maybe it has improved. I am disappointed.",2
"As others have said, this is an intensely flavored yeast product that's not for everyone.<br /><br />But I love it!<br /><br />Sharp, tangy, rich dark flavor of yeast, like a really yeasty beer that's been condensed into a demi-glace.<br /><br />Wonderful on toast, great stirred into sauces, and even good on vegetables.<br /><br />YUM.<br /><br />This used to be so difficult to come by, I'd have British friends bring me jars whenever they traveled back to the UK, and now we can get it on Amazon. How cool is that?<br /><br />Way cool.<br /><br />Try it - you'll hate it or love it, but you'll never know until you try.",5
"I used these Jelly Beans to help me train for my first marathon.  They taste good and seem to work although I did not seem to get as much of a boost as some of my friends say they have. I would only eat 2-4 at a time so maybe I need to eat a few more to get the full energy boost.<br /><br />I agree with some of the other reviewers in that, although the little bag is resealable, it is still sometimes hard to open while you are jogging/running/walking.<br /><br />Nice product.",4
"I purchased this gluten free cake mix with the hope that it would be just as good as the cakes I have been missing since going gluten free about 18 months ago.  Well, yes and no was the response I got from my family and my own impression after I baked it this weekend.  The cake does have a lemon flavor, but it seemed a bit dry for all of our tastes.  Maybe this was because I made cupcakes rather than a cake.  The mix only makes one 8"" cake, not two cakes like most traditional mixes.  I was able to salvage the dryness by making a lemon buttercream frosting as suggested on the packaging.  I wish the package came with a recipe.  I had to look it up on my own.  In the future I will probably make a cake from scratch and continue to add the lemon buttercream frosting for some extra lemony-great taste.",3
"These took FOREVER to ship and when they did arrive they were not as durable as advertized.  Was looking for a bone to keep our dogs busy, these were more like a snack.",1
I love the tea and I cannot believe the price!  This is only 1/3 of the price charged by other companies and the taste is heavenly.  I LOVE this tea.  I cannot believe how fast it arrived.  I appreciate the service and quality and will be buying more tea from this seller.  GREAT JOB!!,5
"My knowledge of the Mexican kitchen is mostly limited to that of the D.F. and state of Mexico so we didn't use achiote all that much. The Yucatan and Quintana Roo produce some delicious dishes and I was curious to try to make some of them, myself. This achiote paste produced just the right color but I found it a bit difficult to get it to dissolve in oil, even with heat and constant stirring. Next time I think I'll try using the actual seeds instead (also available from a supplier to Amazon). I may be wrong but I think achiote is more of a colorante than a saborizante anyway.",4
"We were very excited to order the Blueberry Pancake mixes since we've loved many other Stonewall products. Unfortunately, we didn't like the pancake mix at all. We actually ended up throwing the pancakes away. The batter itself tasted terrible. It had this strong, almost sour taste and almost seemed carbonated/fizzy? We thought it would be better after we cooked it, but it wasn't. Also the blueberries were like hard little rocks.<br /><br />Too bad we bought the 3-pack, because now we have a lot of this product and won't be able to use it.",1

"I have studied canine nutrition for the last 5 years and one of the biggest negatives I see in many commercial dog food companies is putting profit over care.<br /><br />In looking at ingredients in treats and food, many companies are fabulous. However, sadly, some put the cheapest ingredients that often even cause negative reactions in dogs into their products and then add flavors to make the dog want them so they continue to be bought.<br /><br />Ah, but don't take my word for it.<br /><br />First ingredient in these? Rice Flour. Not meat. Not whole wheat flour. Not brown rice flour. Rice flour...bad carb, no protein, breaks down into sugar. But it gets better. Second main ingredient? SUGAR.<br /><br />Let me repeat that. This contains mostly sugar.<br /><br />Yes they are shaped like bones and you feel like you are getting some good protein in and that they aren't like giving your pet hard candy. Naw. That's marketing. They only contain 7% protein and the protein source is derived from ""dried meat by product"".  In other words, meat waste.<br /><br />But lets go back to sugar. You could give your dog a tablespoon of sugar each day and they would crave that too. But you will also have to pay for extra tartar scrapings from your vet which are stressful to your canine companion or have a pet lose their teeth in their later years.<br /><br />But I'm just getting started. 3rd ingredient? Wheat flour. Not whole wheat flour...processed and stripped of it's nutriotional value. Cheaper.<br /><br />So you think the fourth ingredient must be some protein huh? Naw, it's Propylene Glycol.<br /><br />Then powdered cellulose<br /><br />Then sodium caseinate<br /><br />but we dont want our dogs to thumb their paws up at such ingredients so natural poultry FLAVOR is then added. This is what some dog companies do, besides adding sugar, to make a product marketable...have it TASTE to the dog like it has something they need or want in it but it just be a flavoring. Then they beg for it and owners think it's great, buy more, and profit is good.<br /><br />BAD.<br /><br />Now then, let me sum this up with the warning under the feeding guide:<br />""Up to (meaning no more than) 5 sticks every week""<br />and ""not suitable for puppies or dogs under 5 lbs."" Yet the jumbone mini with a yorkie on the front has these ingredients and then says not to give it to small dogs! That is called a legal disclaimer should your dog develop issues from the feeding of this product. What more needs to be said?<br /><br />Yeah, you don't have those warnings about nutritional harm when you just feed your dog some good natural treats or meat.<br /><br />Animal crackers or saltwater taffy would offer your dog the same taste and ingredients for the most part as these and be cheaper.<br /><br />I take it back. The above two wouldn't have as many artificial flavors and preservatives.<br /><br />Don't buy into the hype ""big meaty center""<br /><br />If by ""meaty"" they mean 'sugar and cellulse"" then I agree...<br /><br />I so hate seeing profit over care for companion animals.<br /><br />Why did I give it 2 stars? If you have to go by will your dog like it? You bet! But they like chocolate too...doesn't mean they should eat it.<br /><br />I am not promoting any particular dog food or treat here...just giving my opinion (based on 5 years of study on the subject on my part) that you may wish to avoid sugar and cheap fillers for anything going into your pet. Animals are so little and dependant upon our choices for them. And, especially if you dont brush their teeth daily as most of us don't, giving them something filled with sugar and bad-carb flours is highly detrimental to thier livers, teeth, livers, kidneys, and full canine systems.<br /><br />Not to mention the artificial fillers and dried meat by products. Meat waste can have very bad things in it. It's not suitable for human consumption (these include the parts thrown away that may be diseased or tumerous. Yes, seriously, these ARE allowed to be used in dog food.)<br /><br />And don't even consider the vitamins added. When made into a processed dog food of this type, they get baked out at such high temperatures used in the processing. So consider that teeninsy bit added at the very end of the ingredient list null and void after processing.<br /><br />Buy em a real soup bone or give them carrots or NATURAL wet dog food or cottage cheese for a treat.<br /><br />Dogs don't do well on things like this and it can cost you more in their health than the savings on buying a less expensive brand.<br /><br />I love em (pets) too much not to review this honestly...",2
"I was expecting slightly better ingredients.  I did not expect for the majority of the ingredients to be  fillers; I expected proteins.  Dogs are omnivores leaning to the carnivore end of the spectrum.<br /><br />The package was shipped in an appropriately sized box and had air pillows to minimize crushing.  Not receiving dog food dust was nice.  I was disappointed in the product packaging itself.  There was supposed to be a zippered seal, but the sliding mechanism was missing.  Now my pantry reeks of dog food.<br /><br />Now, the most important part. . . Did my dog like Beneful?  Yes, if I hand fed her or if she were truly hungry.  She seemed to prefer the soft bits, digging around the others to eat them first.  Plus, I have to stay with her while she eats to encourage (trick) her into eating.  Sigh, I have better things to do than beg my dog to eat.",2
"Gosh, they need to sell this item year-round!!  Everytime Christmas rolls around, I have to hit the stores to get a bag or two (at least!) of these nougats.

I enjoy them because they aren't too chewy so that your teeth will fall out, but just chewy enough :)  A definite favorite in this household!",5
"So, I consider this a competitor to the little canned Starbucks coffee drinks you see in the gas station. How does it stack up?<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- Flavor is nice... mild but 'refreshing' when chilled<br />- 81mg of caffeine provide a nice boost<br />- 100 calories mean you can drink this without feeling guilty<br />- no preservatives, natural coffee flavor, etc. add another layer of 'guilt-free' to this product<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- price point really isn't a savings over just snagging other coffee drinks at the gas station or grocery store<br /><br />SUMMARY: if you drink coffee regularly but would like the option for 'quick' canned coffee drinks like this if you are in a rush sometimes, this is a good product for you.

"My husband and I have eaten three of these cakes, so i feel that I can honestly rate Betty Crocker's gluten free cake mix.<br /><br />I have Celiac disease and must eat a gluten free diet or I get very ill.  This cake NEVER made me sick so it is completely 100% gluten free and safe for those on gluten free diets.<br /><br />My husband can freely eat wheat, but he cannot have artificial colors or flavors, so he really enjoyed this cake.  He says it is better than a number of the gluten free cakes we have tried.<br /><br />Personally though, I found that the cake was too dry if you cooked it as long as the directions listed, yet if you tried to take it out earlier it was uncooked in the middle. Plus the cake alone did not taste very good, you had to put icing on it to make it tasty and though my husband loves icing, I am not a fan of icing. I like cake plain.  The cake was also very dense and not fluffy and I love fluffy cakes.<br /><br />So though this is a decent gluten free cake mix, it is not great. I will continue trying new options until I find the best cake mix out there.",3
"These beef flavored rawhide dog bones are a big hit with my 11 month old puppy who loves to chew. She weighs about 20 pounds and one of these 3"" bones will occupy her for an entire night and at least part of the next day.<br /><br />Hartz calls these chews ""Dentist's Best"" because the raw hide has been coated with a chemical called Hexametaphosphate which is supposed to block tartar formation on the dog's teeth and freshen the breath. This ingredient was developed by researchers at Indiana University's School of Dentistry specifically for dogs.<br /><br />These bones, manufactured in Brazil, contain the following ingredients: Beefhide, Maltodextrin, Gluco-Delta-Lactone, Sodium Hexametaphosphate, and Natural and Artificial Flavors.<br /><br />A significant benefit of these treats is that they do not stain, splinter or leave a gummy mess. They sort of slowly disolve as they are licked and chewed.<br /><br />They also come in a smaller, 2"" size <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OX6JDU"">Hartz Dentist'S Best 10Pk 2In. Bone</a> hich is very good for small dogs or when you only want your dog to have a little treat. My puppy can go through a 2"" bone in about an hour.<br /><br />This 3"" size offers a far longer state of puppy bliss. And that is a very good thing.",4

"I'm not going to lie--I was more than a little bit skeptical about Crystal light's new lo cal moctail flavors. I worried this would taste like the watery half-inch remnant of a poorly mixed drink left at 2 a.m. in a sad little casino off interstate I-40. But WHOA. These are too yummy. They are tasty and appromixate the cocktail taste well enough, sans alcohol, of course. It's not the same as ordering a top shelf Mojito, but it definitely passes the test for me. I'm stocking up.<br /><br />I've tried both the Margarita and the Mojito flavor and the Mojito is favorite. Forget raspberry lemonade, these moctails are yummy.<br /><br />I like drinking the moctails on ice, but you can also jazz it up and mix it up in the blender with a splash of something extra. Seriously. No kidding. Try it.",5
"In my quest to find new and exciting cereals for my morning wakeup, I stumbled across a mega-box of Waffle Crisp at the grocery store yesterday and just had to snatch it up.  I love waffles (who doesn't) and so I just had to try this.  What starts off rather delicious turns to mush very quickly, so if you tend to take your time eating your breakfast (which is the case with me since I work from home and eat while I work) then this can turn off-putting rather quickly.  The maple flavor (which is the best part of the waffle experience) is subtle enough to not be overly sweet, but it is also subtle enough to be mistaken for something else entirely.  In fact, this tasted a lot like Cookie Crisp at first, which is not what I was wanting.  My milk was rather delicious in the end, so there is always that.  I can't say that I'm all that impressed really.  I wanted to be, and I expected to be, but at the end of the day (or should I say `morning') I'm left with some mushy mini-sponges swimming in lightly flavored maple milk.",2
"In general, I love Popchips.  (BBQ are my absolute favs.)  These are the chips I go for automatically at the store because of their crisp texture and great taste.<br /><br />This review is for the Chili Lime Popchips.<br /><br />They have a little heat for the Chili and a bit of acid for the Lime, however, I must admit that these are not my favorite.  The taste took some getting used to and, while not awful, this is not a flavor I'll be going back to.  The chips have the same great Popchip texture however, they left a bit of an unpleasant after taste coating the back of my throat.  An after taste that lasted quite a while.<br /><br />Since everyone loves different flavors, I'm sure there will be folks that will love these, but for me, the Chili Lime flavor rated a 3.  Not awful.  Not great.  Not on my shopping list.",3
"The cookies were okay. I enjoyed the chocolate cookies the most. The others were okay and tasted very similar. There was barely any cinnamon flavor in the cinnamon thins. The oatmeal flavor was very weak too. The oatmeal, cinnamon and sugar cookies tasted like sugar cookies. The cookies are very sweet and high in sugar. The texture is good and crispy. If you are into really sweet snacks, these cookies would be great but I expected more flavor. Prepare to drink a big glass of water after eating a pack ^_^.",3
If you want to dabble with cat grass give this a try.  It's inexpensive but there are not many seeds in the product.,3
"Let me start by saying that I really like these cookies. If you're going to give your child cookies, these are not so bad healthwise. However, the size leads you to believe that one bag contains a single serving, when it actually contains 2 servings at 120 calories each. That's a bit too many calories in a snack for a young child, I think. I buy snack packs so that when I'm on the go, I can open a bag and hand it to my kid. I don't feel that I can do that with these.",3
"I adore cinnamon and try different types and sources. Sadly, this cinnamon is tasteless. It is extremely dry [which I assume means it has very little actual ""oil"" in it]. Moreover, its texture is actually unpleasant. It feels as through the cinnamon bark has been ""cut"" with some tasteless, dry filler. Oddly, there is a mild clove aftertaste to this brand. That is not unpleasant but I prefer the spicy flavor of Saigon cinnamon, but that is a personal choice. I can't recommend this particular Ceylon cinnamon. Sorry.",2
This is the greatest snack for your little one. My littl guy loves these because he can hold them easily and I don't worry because they melt when he puts them in his mouth. He loves them so much that when he sees the wrapper he comes crawling over smiling!,5
"This is 4 bags in one big bag.  No air like in potatoe chip bags to keep things from getting smashed.  So, mine got smashed in shipping.  It was 4 bags in a box with some bubble bags and it all just shook around in shipping smashing into each other.<br /><br />The best ones look like peanuts in shells... lots of little dents and some big dents.<br /><br />The worse ones won't even come out of the wrappers due to crushing.  :(  Trapped forever.<br /><br />Can't really use them as is... will just have to give them away at work or something.",2
"As cereals go they are not the surgery-est, but they are a very sweet cereal. The closest other cereal I thought this tasted like was frosted flakes. They are kind of like frosted flakes with a nuttiness to them. The cereal overall is good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it for sure.",3
"For anyone who wants a low carb snack these are a good solution if you are a cheese lover. These little cubes are literally blocks of cheese with the moisture removed. That means they're high in protein and high in fat and, even though these are the ""lower sodium"" version, also still very high in sodium. One package at only 1.7oz delivers a whopping 800mg of sodium. I really like these but they have a lot going against them. They're VERY expensive. 1.7 oz is almost nothing. They are very high in fat and the sodium is about twice what it should be. That being said, I would still recommend these as an occasional low carb snack if you're not hypertensive.",3
"Capers in brine cannot compare.  These are high quality capers in salt at a good price from Agostino Recca.  You can find them in 2.2 oz. jars for about five dollars.  This one is twenty-four oz.  So I could have given this five stars on best buy basis.<br /><br />I gave it four stars considering only a few in brine get three stars.  Most get one star as weak and adulterated by things other than salt in the brine.  So most pure salt brine still get only two stars.  Not worth the low quality since these are available.<br /><br />This is my everyday old reliable.  Do not cook them.  Rinse out the salt if you do not need it, and use them after cooking is over, even in a caper sauce.  They need only warm to blossom.  They respond well to mortar and pestle.<br /><br />I saved five stars for the ones from Pantalleria which go with caviar.",4
I didn't think Hormel would make chili as bland as this.  The hot version is so much better than this stuff.  I was truly disappointed in this product and will not buy it again.,2
Not as strong as the regular dark coffee.  Disappointing after having Sumatra at Starbucks. Wouldn't get it again.  It just didn't taste like the real deal.,2
"It took some time, but I finally got my cats to savor Newman's Own Organics Adult Cat Dry Formula. (The green labeled bag is just as good).

I also mix Newman's Own Organics Advanced Cat Dry Formula with small amounts of other dry cat food as treats for them. This is premium cat food and I love the packaging's very effective zip lock and the graphics to. I highly recommend Newman's Own Organics.",5

"I tried to change food on him to a cheaper brand, but he refused so I decided to crack out the cash! However, I wanted to say that one thing that upset me when I got my order today (a few days early!YAY!) was that the bag is half empty.  I know it's by design but I think it could really save packaging and stuff if the food actually fit into the bag and not been twice the size of where the food ends.  I like that the food has good things for my dog and not crap.  I feed myself only organic food, why would I feed my service dog anything other than that too?",5

I had bought another brand previously to this one....Berry Farm or something like that but they were out of stock so I settled on this company and consequently having to buy a whole lot more.  This powder is pale in color by comparison and the flavor is not nearly as good with a bitter after taste perhaps from using too much woody stem.,2
"While the taste of this coffee is good, for some reason, it tends to clog in the brewing process.  I've used it in 3 different brewers with the same problem.  To prevent this problem, the K-cup has to be shaken immediately prior to brewing.  Perhaps the coffee is ground too fine and is getting packed down as the water is being pressed through the K-cup.  I probably wouldn't buy this brand again.",3

"Yes, these are hot chocolate capsules that fit in Caffitaly coffee machines. No, they don't make very good chocolate. How could they? Think about the various ways of making a good cup of hot chocolate, and then try to figure out how anyone could stuff that into a little capsule -- it's not possible.<br /><br />Even if you want a mocha, there are better ways to make one than one capsule of espresso and one capsule of this chocolate in the same cup.<br /><br />Is it truly awful? No. Just not very rich and satisfying. And you're supposed to use the ""long espresso"" setting when making hot chocolate, so it doesn't produce very much -- I think it's just 3 ounces.",3
"This is a decent coffee that is bold tasting up front, which I like, but then has a harsh aftertaste.  It is cheaper than the others, I didn't mind it, but it was not my favorite.",4
This is a good tea but it doesn't have as much of the fruit flavor as the other Ahmad teas I've tried.  I drink these teas iced so the more fruit flavor the better they taste.,4
"New to the world of Keurig, I bought these K-cups in a large package for my husband and I to share.  Unfortunately we were very disappointed.  Hot chocolate K-cups are designed to quick-dissolve (compared to the regular hot chocolate packages you buy from the store) and it tastes like chemicals.  The milk chocolate is no different than the dark chocolate when it comes to chemical taste.  After playing with different water level settings, I eventually just had to throw them out.  Now we buy normal hot chocolate packets instead.",1
"I really like this rice blend. I cook it in my electric steamer using vegetable broth instead of water, and it always comes out great. The 6-pack is a lot of rice though - if you don't eat rice frequently, you may want to store the bags in the freezer.",5
I love this stuff. It has really helped me with a lot of things. I absolutely swear by it. I probably drink this tea at least once a week. Sometimes several times a day if I feel the need.,5
THE PACKAGING IS GREAT AND IS THE PERFECT SIZE FOR THE POPPER WE GOT. THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE IS THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET THE CONTENTS TO POUR INTO THE KETTLE PROPERLY WITHOUT MAKING A MESS. HAVE TO PUT IN A SEPERATE CONTAINER WITH A SPOUT. THE FLAVOR IS GREAT!!,5
"Ask a Chinese friend about ""forbidden rice"" (&#31105;&#31859;), unless they are history buff like myself, they will give you a puzzled look.  The term refers to an obscure trade policy during Manchurian dynasty, not an exotic rice.  I will not going to bore you  with history here.<br /><br />The story about emperor depriving commoners of red rice is a hoax made in America, like the legion of fortune cookies. Most fortune cookies are made in a wholesome factory near Atlanta.  We trust that fortune cookies are safe to eat.  ""Forbidden rice?""<br /><br />There is a red rice in China, dark red, close to red bean.  The color varies from gran to gran. Its thick bran provides a pleasant nutty flavor and al dente texture.  The color does not come off easily.  You can get them from Chinese grocery store.<br /><br />What is sold as ""forbidden rice"" at Amazon and Costco has a uniformed black to deep purple color.  It appears to be rice over-milled, dyed, and polished.  Drop a few grains in water, you can see color coming off.  And the color tent to sink to the bottom. That is a easy tell tail.  When cooked, the favor and texture of bran are absent.  If they use red rice, they have milled away its bran to make the rice easy to dye.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with using food coloring.  But is the ink FDA approved?  We do not know.  The label does not say.<br /><br />I am returning mine to Costco.  I will ask Costco to pull it off the shelf.",1

"These Mozzarella Cheese-it's could be better<br /><br />Sure, They are cheesy, but they are not mozzarella cheesy. at least not to me. They tasted more like a white Cheddar and that was a major disappointment<br /><br />Second, they left a really bad aftertaste that reminded me of drinking diet soda and that was really unpleasant.<br /><br />I'd just stick with regular Cheezit's or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ONPN40"">the Hot & Spicy</a> ones.

"We have two dogs, one with a sensitive stomach and another with skin allergies. I had them on another food as well as yogurt and Pepcid AC for the stomach and Zyrtec for the skin - but it was only making a minor difference. Dylan, with the stomach problems, was still vomiting several times a week and Kuma (the skin) was slamming her body against the walls, bed and anything else and dragging herself along to relieve the itching. After switching to this diet we began to notice a big difference. I was also able to stop the yogurt, Pepcid and Zyrtec. Also their fur is much more soft and shiny. To be clear, I haven't noticed Dylan getting sick since we've been well into the diet and Kuma no longer does any unusual itching. The dogs are about 50 lbs each and we go through roughly one large bag a month - not a bad price to pay for healthy, happy dogs!!",5
"This coffee did not have as much flavor as I would have liked.  Van Houtte vanilla has a stronger coffee and vanilla flavor, which I enjoy.  I like strong coffee and drink it black.  My daughter likes less strong coffee and adds milk and sugar and thought it was tasty but she also prefers the Van Houtte (which I think I'm spelling wrong - Van Houte?)",3
"I expected a lot from these beans after reading some of the reviews here on Amazon. I expected a rich, flavorful espresso bean. These beans appear to be under roasted. They are very light in appearance and don't have any of the customary oil that I find thinly coating other quality coffee beans. I still gave them a try, and the resulting brew did taste better than expected, but was nothing to write home about. They do make a very nice cup of regular coffee if ground using the 'course' setting of my bur grinder. I've decided to just use them for coffee as they make a pleasing cup of moderately strong coffee if you use enough beans. I use approximately twice as many beans as I do with the 100% Kona that is my usual bean to get coffee that tastes substantial. These beans also cost half as much as the Kono beans do, so I guess that's tolerable.<br /><br />I would not recommend these for Espresso. For normal coffee they're fine, but still not in any way remarkable.",3
"I love raspberry and chocolate.  I could live on Sees Raspberry chocolate truffles.  But this coffee, ugh.  Brewing it smells pretty nice, a bit fruity, not much chocolate.  In the mug- awful chemical processed cleaner/air freshener flavor (not that I am in the habit of eating those) but hot it just tastes artificial. It does have some sweet taste to it, but even adding milk and sugar do not make it drinkable.<br /><br />If I let it sit around (and really, I bought the Keurig so I could have coffee NOW when I wanted it, not in 10 minutes) and it cools, it becomes passable.  But only barely.  The chemical flavor dissipates and it is drinkable, but only because after spending that much on coffee, I feel obligated to.<br /><br />Spare yourself the torture, skip this coffee, unless you like the taste of lysol, then it might be for you!",2
"My hair dresser's salon bought a Keurig Machine, so I have been able to sample a variety of K-Cups. K-cups are about 10 times more expensive than a regularly brewed cup of coffee so I have never considered buying one for myself, but having a Keurig Machine at a hair salon makes sense! People have a variety of tastes and K-Cups can provide a nice variety and freshly made one at that.<br /><br />The salon has a nice variety of K-cups: Folders, Wolfgang Puck, Timothy's, and Green Mountain (that owns Keurig).<br /><br />Everyone's taste vary, but here is my assessment of the ones that I have tried so far.

"In the politically correct age in which we live, ""skinless and boneless"" sardines have invaded supermarket shelves promising an appropriate and civilized eating experience. If that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere. These are the real thing, and I guess if they're not skinless and boneless then what else can they be but skinny and boney? While this may sound a bit rough around the edges, well, what the heck.<br /><br />Before going any further I have to disclose that I eat sardines every day for lunch. I've tried `em all, and these plump pilchards are right up there among the best.<br /><br />Generally I've operated from the premise that Portuguese sardines are superior, but these are increasingly expensive and sometimes hard to find. So when the local gourmet food store forgot to place my order I looked for an alternative and came across this Spanish substitute. At this juncture my knowledge of geography stood me in good stead as I realized that the Atlantic waters off of Portugal are contiguous with those of Spain, and clearly the fish know no boundaries in between. How different therefore could they be at less than one third the price?<br /><br />This seemed too good to be true and when I noted that they are packed in a combination of soy and olive oil rather than olive oil alone, my suspicions were aroused. Subsequent research into the matter uncovered the finding of the American College of Chest Physicians that soy oil contains omega 3 fatty acids. Sardines themselves are rich in these most beneficial substances so immersing them in more of the same could only seem to make a good thing better.<br /><br />And finally, to cut to the chase, these fish taste great, especially with a liberal squirt of fresh lemon.<br /><br />I do, however, perform a quick dissection prior to indulging.",5

"from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.:<br /><br />Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.<br /><br />Sorry. Don't kill the messenger.<br /><br />It's easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word ""Agave"" has a fine pedigree, coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It's also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.<br /><br />Unfortunately there's zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup.<br /><br />Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, because it's low-glycemic (we'll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as ""diabetic friendly"". What's not to like?<br /><br />As it turns out, quite a lot.<br /><br />Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS.<br /><br />Fructose -- the sugar found naturally in fruit -- is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples (about 7 percent fructose) -- it comes with a host of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. But when it's commercially extracted from fruit, concentrated and made into a sweetener, it exacts a considerable metabolic price.<br /><br />Research shows that it's the fructose part of sweeteners that's the most dangerous. Fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides (a risk factor for heart disease). It also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome (AKA pre-diabetes) .<br /><br />And fructose has been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease. Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain and extra abdominal fat.<br /><br />In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to break it down into digestible sugar (fructose), resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent.<br /><br />""Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing,"" said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. ""Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses"", she told me. ""Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK"".<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you.",1

Because of that, he was becoming underweight and I decided to switch him away from dry kibble to have him gain some weight first before worrying bout his picky taste.<br />However when I give him ziwipeak, he would finish it up right away!<br /><br />This brand is expensive, but based upon the amounts you feed, it isn't really that much expensive if you have a small dog. I have a 2 pound puppy that is expected to mature at about 4-5 pounds, and the costs is about 25cents extra a day. If you have a big dog that's gonna gobble up 1/3 of a bag or more a day, then that will be a lot more expensive for you.<br /><br />But......<br />The quality of food and the fact that it is in a jerky meat form makes it a lot better than eating hard dry kibble all day long.<br />Anyone would be bored of eating biscuits everyday for his entire life :/<br /><br />The quality of this food is unsurpassed.<br />There have been no problems at all with this food at all as well either. No recalls, all made in New Zealand as well.<br /><br />Something that I tell a lot of people.<br />Spend more on food daily, and not risk the possibility of having a sick dog due to some pet food recall. Vet bills are going to cost you a few thousand dollars.<br />Expensive dog food will probably add up to the same cost as most over the duration of your dog's life, unless you have a really big dog.<br />So instead of having to go through the grief of having a puppy in pain, and you undergoing mental and emotional stress, why not just give it a food that is good and safe and something that the dog enjoys, and spare yourself from all that unnecessary trouble?<br /><br />Yes times are hard and most people are having difficulty putting dinner on the table for themselves or their kids. So there are situations where foods like this are just too much to afford.<br />So unless if your budget really is a problem, I would recommend this food to anyone!",5
"I was hopeful that Tasty Bite would be a nice, easy home alternative to expensive Indian food but it wasn't. The sauces are bland and boring. The Rogan Josh is equally unexciting. I added a lot of additional spices and other ingredients to both in order to get a decent sauce. I guess you could call it a workable Indian sauce base, but that's about it.",2
"What the Amazon nutritional info does not show you is that this has 4g of trans fat per bag, which is a ton.  This is a very unhealthy product that is very bad for you -- stick with just about any other microwave popcorn on the market and you'll have zero or a miniscule amount of trans fat, which most companies have eliminated because it is so bad for you.",2
"Tried the almonds today for the first time.  I'm ordering a case right now.  Best ever, ever, ever!!!",5
"I bought two of these for corporate Christmas gifts and though everyone loved the world famous jelly beans, I was disappointed at the thin basket and rather ""small"" look to it. I also bought the larger rectangular box of Jelly Bellies (reminded me of the size of a Monopoly game box) and added it to the basket to make it look more substantial. I think next year I will just get more of the box jelly beans.",3
"If I could, I would give it zero stars.  I am not a picky eater, but this mix did not rise (can you say hockey puck), was extremely bitter, and not sweet even with the recommended amount of sweetener added.  Save your money.",1
"I must admit I like them, and they are a healthy alternative to a candy bar.  But at about $1.50 each for a very small light bar, they're too expensive for most.  Honey, nuts, and a few pieces of dried fruit shouldn't cost that much.  A competitor may come along hopefully with a better value.",2
"There is really no added nutritional benefit to this product and to call it ""veggie pasta"" is seriously stretching the limits of credibility.  I get it: kids love Kraft mac & cheese.  Here's I used to ""sneak"" veggies in to mac & cheese: at the last minute, I poured a handful of green peas in to the macaroni.  Was it hidden? Of course not, but my kids grew up thinking that was how Kraft mac & cheese was.  It was only the occasional visiting neighbor kid who ever protested.",2
"I bought this for a hiking trip in New England's mountains.  I neglected to take into account all of the black flies.  I was quite protected from the large mosquitoes I saw on parts of the hike, but was constantly swarmed by black flies.  I wish I would have found another product, as this did not work in the backwoods of New England.  However, it would work well in areas without those pesky flies.",3
"I have tried several coffee k-cups. From Starbucks to Moonlight coffee...virtually every kcup<br />This coffee tastes more like chemicals. No wonder the price is so low.<br /><br />Do not buy this Coffee -- sorry to say !!!  The worst coffee i ever bought and the biggest mistake i did that I bought several ones.... If anyone needs the chemical coffee , i am willing to sell it out for 50% less price",1
I love Zevia Ginger Rootbeer! I thought it might have a bitter aftertaste like other diet soft drinks but it didn't. I started drinking it because I am watching my carbs and sugar grams but like a good rootbeer once in a while. I wanted to be able to have one without a lot of sugar and without artificial sweeteners. I'm so glad I found out about this one. It hits the spot every time.<br /><br />This past weekend I took a sip of regular rootbeer and didn't care for it because I'm used to Zevia ginger rootbeer and prefer it. My husband enjoys it too and he's not watching his sugar or on a weight loss plan. He just likes the taste.<br /><br />I didn't think we'd work our way through our 24 cans so quickly. I'm looking forward to our next shipment.,5
"Anyone who makes Waffles for any length of time knows this is the ONLY mix worth buying.  It is the one served at the better breakfast restaurants. motels, hotels and homes.  I hate to give any product 5-stars because there is always room for improvement.  However,I have no idea how this product could be improved on.  Add you own berry's, bacon, ham, etc.  But don't do it too often.  It really is best right out of the container.",5
The stuff is pretty bad to eat straight.  However it went great in the soup.  It soaked up all the flavors nicely and kept the soup from being watery.  It's just soy bean and no salt added which is great for my husband with blood pressure problems.,4
"I'm still on the fence with this tea. I've been drinking Lipton decaf iced tea blend & thought I'd change things up with a different decaf iced tea. This tea is really strong & so full of tannins, if I oversteep it, it's awful. It's almost a reddish color when it brews. It brews much faster than Lipton does, and using 2 bags for iced is almost too strong. It goes from good to too-strong in no time at all. I do like the bags they use, maybe that's why I'm getting it too strong, it def. brews faster with the style bags PG uses. I'm hoping this tea grows on me.",3
Can't buy these fresh where I live.  These dried ones are geat in soups & casseroles.  I've also soaked them in water and used them in an omelet.  Dried mushrooms are good because you don't have to worry about them going bad before you get them all used up.,5
"Very thin consistency. About the same as corn syrup. But the REALLY bad thing is the shocking chemical taste! It's like sweet shampoo. I kid you not. It is THAT awful. I'd write it off as a bad experience if it was a 16 oz. bottle, but this is a half gallon of stuff you couldn't pay me to eat again.",1
"I have to say I was expecting a lot. I had been giving my dog Greenies but they were becoming outrageously priced. I thought I'd try these ones and admittedly, my dog loves them. The only problem is the treats stink. As in they smell, bad. I was hoping with a name like ""Freshies"" they would help with bad breath but so far they just seem to mask whatever he'd eaten before them. Don't get me wrong, they don't smell totally awful, I just had expectations of ""fresh"" not chicken smell.",3
"My 17 month old boy loves these, I don't give him as much of these as I used to since he is now into table food more than purees, but I would mix half of this in his oatmeal in the morning or if we are out, I'll use these as a snack or dessert. They are a good handy pouch to throw in your diaper bag and can sit there for days, if not weeks! I love all the ingredients in this one, baby seems to enjoy it too!",5
"Sorry to see this product was made in China. After the discovery of the bad dog food from China in addition to other things (lead paint in children's toys), I don't feel completely confident that these treats are not harmful.",3
"I have been a fan of chai tea for a long time and occassionally will try different brands.  In my book, a good cup of chai tea does not require sugar and cream, and has tastes of cinnamon, vanilla, and cardamon.  I picked up this box at the local store because it was relatively inexpensive in comparison to most of the other brands.  I also hoped that ""double spice"" meant double the tea servings. I was wrong.  Like other reviewers have observed, the tea tasted very bitter.  An extremely strong black pepper note seemed to overwhelm the rest of the spices.  I have liked other Stash brand teas, but I was very disappointed with this one.  Unfortunately, the box now sits in the cabinet collecting dust.",1
"Way to much salt. 930 mg in a cup. Won't buy again. If Amazon would post the the nutrition ingredients, I and other customers would not buy item's we can't use. Clearly a waste of money.",1
"I'm usually a big fan of Starbucks' bagged coffees and of flavored coffees in general, but this one just has an odd taste and aftertaste to it.  It doesn't even really taste like vanilla to me -- just like some kind of flavored hot beverage.  I even tried brewing this with different strengths to see if that made any difference, but it doesn't seem to make any difference.  I'd stay away from this one.  It really just doesn't taste good.",1
"They seemed to be very old.  I guess the shipper collects them but they are not stored well so they don't look fresh.  They are ""cloudy"".",3
"Both our twins love this one right from the start but it's not loaded with lentils (see ingredients below).  We introduced it when they were 7 months old and now they're 10 months.  I'm glad they are eating something green because we couldn't get them to eat the one with peas when we tried at 7 months, but we got them to eat the peas later at 9 months.<br /><br />Their favorite vegetable is sweet potato and we've also tried sweet potato with cinnamon. They love all the fruit varieties.<br /><br />I'm glad they love this one because lentils and brown rice form a complete protein, although a view of the ingredients shows that lentils is not one of the prime ingredients.<br /><br />This one also has carrots and I've heard all babies like carrots.  I don't know if they would like it without the carrots.  I haven't seen this one - lentils and brown rice - in our local stores, so I'm glad to get it here. Along with some others, we get this one with the subscription.  Of course, with twins one is forced to buy more in bulk and we're so busy that it's great to get these delivered.<br /><br />The packaging is excellent.  I've ordered an unbelievable number of cases of jars of different types and only had one jar arrive broken.<br /><br />Ingredients per label: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, organic brown rice, organic lentils, organic canola oil.<br /><br />This has 70 calories, 10% protein, 100% vitamin A, 4% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 4% iron.<br /><br />I'm informed that the daily intake percentage is based on an adult.",3
"So I tolerate a lot of things in the name of being healthy. And I will slowly work my way through the 12 bags of these nuts. But I have to tell you it's like chewing on sawdust tablets. They're extremely dry (to the point of being a choking hazard if you don't follow every mouthful with water), hard, and of course flavorless because they're soynuts and also unsalted. So I'm sure they're good for me but there's no pleasure in eating them.",4
"I was really excited to get the Good Bean sea salt snacks in the mail and slightly disappointed when I tried them. They were really chalky and a little too salty for me. But I kept eating them because, hey, I bought six bags and I wasn't going to waste them! The funny thing is they grew on me. I liked the cinnamon ones better, but I now reach for them out of a desire to snack on them rather than feeling like I have to eat them.",3
"It's hard to find good Sources of protein, while eating a plant based diet. And this product has high protein and fiber! Great Combo!",5
There was really nothing special about these cookies. They weren't very sweet and  were a lot harder than I thought they'd be.,2
"Tried the pink lemonade flavor today during my long run...unbelievably awesome. Tasted great, no stomach issues, no sticking to my teeth, water not required to ""wash it down"" and most importantly - it was the best run I've had in a long time. Can't wait to try other flavors.",5
"These have a great crunch and it's great that it's low fat. However, it's way too salty. 280mg per serving is more than twice the amount of regular flavor chips like Lays. The cheddar and sour cream and onion flavor is delicious but also way too salty and too much sodium for my taste buds or health.",2
"I chose this brand because of the price and free shipping availability.  Delivery was as  promised and in perfect condition.  I had had this brand before as well as many others.  It is not my favorite, but ranks highly.",4
"I truly love Bassett's JBs!!!!  If you buy them, and you love sweet jelly candy - you'll love these guys!  However, I bought the item thinking the package was the bag about 3 times this size - mistake.  This package is 215g which weighs 1/2 pound.  $20 for a pound of these is a complete rip!!!!  This item actually sells for about $3 in stores where you can find this English treat.  Be careful - unlike me.",1
This is quite the buy compared to other hot chocolates. The kids love it quick and easy.I will order this hot chocolate again.,5
"Purchased this for my husband, who only drinks tea. He prefers Irish Breakfast tea, but often drinks English Breakfast tea as well. He tried it and stated it tasted like Tetl*y tea. To me, it tasted like the orange pekoe tea served at fast food establishments.  It isn't unpleasant, but it just doesn't taste like Irish Breakfast tea, even when brewed with a large amount of leaves in a single cup.",3
"The first cup I brewed was awful.  Nice bergamot scent but horrible BITTER tea taste.  I tried brewing two more times using alternate techniques.  But, still horrible BITTER tea each time.  I will not buy this brand again.",1
This wheat is so amazing. It is bigger and sprouts better than other top brands.It tastes great and is also packed for food storage lasting years and years. I couldn't use another brand after using Handy Pantry. It also was shipped super fast.,5
"The supplier was prompt with the delivery.<br />Marshall Creek Spices are the freshest I've ever used.  I recommend them highly.  In this case, Dill Weed.<br />This is a favorite of mind.  Buying it from Amazon.com is a wonderful endeavor because it cuts out the mid-<br />dle man we've all encountered ""local super market"" with its greedy prices on its tiny, little jars of spices.<br /><br />I have only one problem with Marshall Creek.  Their  containers at the top are not fitted with an adjustment<br />allowing only a small amount of the spice out at a time.  The top, once you take the cover off to get to the spice, has nothing to allow the spice out gradually.  I started using a teaspoon, dipping it inside the large container to scoop up a bit of the spice gradually.  This way prevents spillage.<br />Other then this I'm very happy with Marshall Creek Spices.  I bought a variety of them and I'm not disap-<br />pointed with their freshness.<br />One other thing.  I couldn't find celery bits any place, at least online. Until..... Suddenly, there it was.  Mar-<br />shall Creek had it.  I bought it and love it.  It works well for me as a disabled person I can't always get out to shop for produce, so in this way,  I have celery and onions for my spaghetti sauce, stir fry dishes, etc.<br />I'm happy.

"For product to work properly (IMHO) you need coffee ground as fine as possible. Once filter has been inserted, plave carefully leveled measure of coffee in it. Manuever lid into place, then press down on center-STEADILY- w/ thumb.<br /><br />Plan to use no more than 6 Oz. of water for your cup.<br /><br />Removal of used cup from machine is occasional problem. (Jiggle it and it will generally loosen up.)",1
"This is a great hydrating product, that's 100% natural. You can find it cheaper at Vitacost, with free s/h over $49. Just a FYI.",5
"I drink a lot of energy drinks because of the job that I do and I am  particular that they be healthy.  I do love the taste, although not real thrilled at the price here.  I will probably order when Amazon has a special running but I can pick this up for $7.16 at the local health food store.",4
I hated the taste and consistcy of these cookies.  Not very good at all.  I tried a variety of josephs brand sugar free cookies and did not like any of them.,1
"I eat these for breakfast a lot with my morning coffee. The peanut butter is by far my favorite flavor. My cat waits for me to finish so she can lick the inside of the wrapper (not kidding!) for any peanut butter. I read labels and this contains no hydrogenated oil. I keep one in my purse and in my desk, and our kids backpack for a reasonably healthy snack. Excellent choice for hiking too.",5
"I am a coffee addict and very particular when it comes to coffee. The Melitta brand doesn't disappoint. It may sounds cheesy, but this is heaven in a bean. So rich, tasty and delicious to the point I can't stop drinking it. Also, Melitta is affordably priced and gives you a nice buzz that can sometimes be lacking in other coffee brands. A much recommended coffee that I urge everyone try.<br /><br />Katiebabs",5
I bought these after watching the Anthony Bourdain episode where he goes to spain and eats super expensive canned seafood.  These are probably not the same ones from the show but its better than nothing.  These are a bit too oily for my taste with a metallic tangy aftertaste.  They could be pretty good with some wine or some type of alcohol but then again everything is better with alcohol.  If you don't mind the metallic aftertaste then I would recommend this.,3
"My kitty loves tuna and dry cat food.  I've never tried to give her soft food until this.  She didn't eat it until it was in her dish for most of the day when she had eaten her regular dry food.<br />It looks like it would be good.  It looks like pieces of fish, but for some reason this didn't excite her as much as tuna.<br />I'm getting a new kitty soon, and I'll update it when I try to give new kitty this food.<br />Edit: New kitty likes it fine.  This isn't her favorite choice.  She likes tuna, chicken, and beef all better than this.  Unlike the other cat, she likes this more than dry food - about as much as she likes the Iams wet food I also feed her.",3
This juice is truly magical. It has given me such energy and vitality I didn't know I could have. I no longer get that late afternoon slump and I just keep going until bed time. I sleep great.  I know it's good for me too with all the wholesome nutrients a whole food supplies. I don't bother with a multiple vitamin anymore. This is all I need for the most part. I just love it and recommend it highly to anyone wanting to do something healthy for themselves. So drink to good health. Thanks Goji.,5
"After reading all of the reviews, I ordered this.  I am trying to lower my cholesterol and I am not fond of rolled oats.  I was a bit disappointed in this product.  I guess that I expected a better textured oatmeal, but I was not pleased with the ""brown rice"" cooked product.  Yes, it was like eating brown rice for breakfast - not that I have anything against brown rice.  This oatmeal does have a little more flavor than regular rolled oats oatmeal.  I also don't have time to cook oatmeal every morning for at least 30 minutes, so I guess you could say that I don't have time for these oats.  If you have the time and like oatmeal to begin with, you may like these.  If you don't like oatmeal and don't have a bunch of time to spend cooking these, then I wouldn't suggest buying them.  Personally, I am going back to eating old fashioned rolled oats - 3 minutes in the microwave and they are done.",3
"I found this product at my local Whole Foods for significantly less, which is shocking considering Whole Foods isn't exactly known for low prices - and I purchased in bulk on Amazon so the per unit price definitely should have been better.  Also, infant cereal is supposed to be 1/4 cup of dry cereal to 2 oz. of liquid, which is what it says on this container, but the cereal is way too thick when you make it like that.  The instructions say that 1/4 cup is 14 grams of cereal, which is not true; I weighed it myself and came up with about double that in grams.  So I have no idea whether the nutrition facts apply to the 14g or the 1/4 cup.  My daughter seems to like the cereal, though she definitely prefers the multigrain and oatmeal from this brand.",2
"I can't find sesame sticks anywhere where I live unless I was to pay a lot for them, so I turned to Amazon.com and found these.  I was truely surprised because not only was it a great price (even better because it was on sale) but these are probably the best sesame sticks I have ever had.",5
"The product tastes great.  It tastes like higher end bottled water.  One reviewer called the taste ""silky"" and I can't think of a better description for it.  It goes down smooth, that's for sure.<br /><br />I'm unsure about certain aspects of this water.  On the one hand, I wish I would have had some during the times my youngest suffered from acid reflux or when anyone in the household suffered from an upset stomach.  On the other, I'm concerned that drinking too much of it will cause an imbalance with stomach acids, causing further digestion problems.<br /><br />I do think this is an excellent product overall for those who need it. For me, I'm probably going to keep a bottle or two on hand for upset stomachs.  I don't think I will be drinking it daily or replacing my current water-of-choice with it.",4
"I have enjoyed Nutiva Organic Shelled Hempseed for three years.  But I just received a three pound bag that was puffed up with air.  When I opened it up, it still smelled like hemp seed so I took a bite and swallowed it.  Not only did it taste bitter, but it burned my throat!  Amazon is refunding my money and I am going to try a different brand of hemp seed.  I suspect improper packaging or storage which is a shame because Nutiva's product is really good when it is fresh.",1
"This soup had a strange, gritty texture in my mouth, like when you get a mouthful of sea water, and it left an unappetizing residue at the bottom of the bowl.  It also came out darker than most mulligatawny I've had in the past, with a bitter ingredient I didn't recognize, a flavor that lingered in my mouth, and not in a good way.  I can't say I hated this soup, it was palatable, but I won't go out and pick up another pack any time soon.",2
Equals 100 lbs. of fresh tomatoes. This is my guesstmate not science. Awsome flavor and I think a awsome value. These folks put out high quality product for reasonable prices.,5
This product was awful. Difficult to use without it sticking to your fingers. It tasted metallic. I am just glad I ordered one packet to test before investing. Yuk!,1
"I am not rating this food with three stars because I dispute the quality of ingredients, or that it's one of the healthiest commercial dog food available on the market. Wellness is an excellent brand, more importantly, one whose quality control I trust. My dogs are doing fairly well on it, too, however, the reason I cannot give the Super 5 Mix a five star review is for the unusually low levels of protein and fat, which are not suitable for my highly active Beagles.<br /><br />My dogs spend as much time outdoors as they do snoring on the couch (which is a lot), and unfortunately, the 22/12 ratio of fat:protein does not cut it for them. By most standards 22% is a very low amount for even a maintenance diet, and despite the inclusion of whole grains, fruits, and veggies, I've found that I need to add oils and meat on a daily basis because their coats have been thinning out/shedding more than usual and their muscle mass has definitely decreased in the several weeks I've been feeding it. I'm very disappointed because it's only the middle of summer, when they normally maintain their coat very well and are less active than in the cooler months. Energy levels are also not very good... I am seeing spikes and crashes which is usually indicative of a high carbohydrate feed, so alas, will have to find another, more meat based diet for my pack. Although I would still recommend this for less active dogs - it's just not right for mine.",3
"I love this tea, I gave some to my friends and we all agree, this is a delightful tasty tea. The price is also excellent.",5
This bowl was like eating salt. The noodles were surprising noodle like for a microwave meal but all I could taste was salt. I threw the bowl away after a couple of bites. Then I looked at the nutritional facts and was disgusted. I will not eat this again. Also I followed the direction but the bowl still overflowed and made a mess.,1
"I found that the pod made a very weak and not very flavorful cup of coffee. I didn't think it had much of an aroma either. Sadly, I would only consider this adequate coffee in a total coffee emergency. I prefer medium to dark roasts, and this just didn't have a good flavor. If you like very mild coffee, you might like this.",3
"Let me say I like a medium roast coffee.. and this is NOT a medium roast coffee. I would call this Light or very LIGHT.<br />This comes as indicated in the description in single coffee pods for use with Single pod coffee makers.<br /> I notice when I opened the package the coffee smell was missing.. Now I don't know if that is particular to this type coffee or if my package had a little age on it.. I even opened a 2nd package to see if my first didn't get punctured accidentally.. but sadly it wasn't..<br />  I even brewed this in my  single serve coffee maker on BOLD setting.. but it just didn't do anything to improve it.<br /><br /> I do support the concept of this coffee company but this particular type of coffee is not to my taste.But saying that  everyone has their own taste when it comes to coffee and tea so this is just my PERSONAL OPINION AND TASTE.. Just to be fair I am a regular Dunkin donuts whole bean user so that is what I am comparing this coffee.<br /><br />Sadly I won't be ordering more of this particular version but will see what other flavors they may be selling at this company But if you like your coffee LIGHT this might be a version you would enjoy, it just didn't do it for me.",2
"I've been a coffee snob since the mid '80s.  I've done all but roast my own, and was preparing to try that.  However, my stomach is no longer into my deep and abiding love for really good coffee.  After I tried to stick with just tea for a couple of years, a friend from England convinced me that instant coffee is worth at least a taste.  Gasp!  I ordered some Nescafe Gold, on his recommendation, and it was actually... good.  Really good.  After happily drinking it for as long as my pocketbook would allow (those pesky import costs), I found this Douwe Egberts Pure Gold, here on Amazon.  I'm not sure I'll go back!  It's lovely!  I drink it hot, and also cold in the summer time.  I pour about a 1/4 cup of cold water into the grounds and let them sit for a few minutes, give it a quick stir (it even foams a little), and then I add milk to fill the glass, and a little evaporated cane juice.  Although I still enjoy a good latte, made RIGHT... for daily drinking, I don't think I'll go back to home ground and brewed coffee.  Just don't tell anyone. ;)",5
"I got this oil at a local grocery.  It surprised me when I first tasted it. It almost seems a bit spicy!  I love Colavita olive oils and this is a great one.  Would be excellent to use directly on food, as opposed to cooking with it.  Great salad dressing, add a bit to steamed veggies, awesome dip for crusty bread, etc.  I paid $14.74 today at HEB (TX grocery) for this size bottle.",5
"I have been using this coffee since my brother introduced it to me, about two years ago.  So - - when I got my Kuerg, the first thing I did was order the Green Mountain Natucket Blend.

"As a gastric bypass patient, I'm always looking for ""snacks"" that are either ""low in calories, high in protein,"" etc. and this fits both bills. Even has 5 grams of fiber, and who CAN'T use more of that in their lives, huh?",4
As the title says you wouldn't know this was gluten free unless you made it yourself. As a wonderful bonus I cook this cornbread in our bread maker on the cake setting. Turns out awesome every time.,5
"I like that this is a reasonably priced organic dog food that is readily available. I switched to this when the brand I had been feeding my dogs for years began to upset the tummy of my senior. However, neither of my dogs (even my ""chowhound"") is crazy about it. They eventually did eat it, but it took a lot of coaxing. But the tummy problems did clear up.",3
Chocolates are great. Shipping costs are high. They took close to a week to actually ship the chocolates.,2
"This drink contains a lot of ingredients, many that I was happy to see, such as Vitamins C,B6, B12, Zinc, Selenlum, Folic Acid and Potassium, as well as their Proprietary Blend which includes Taurine, Inositol, Grape Seed Extrace, L-Carnitine and L-Arginine.  Was not happy that it contained Caffeine, Sodium, corn syrup, soy and sugar--For this reason, I would not purchase this as a ""health drink.""  This drink has sort of a citrus taste and goes down easy when cold.  Eight fluid ounces of this drink is 34 total carbs, so most people would want to drink this 16 FL OZ can in two servings.  This product made me a little sick to my stomach, but I was far from being wired.  I do not plan on purchasing this product in the future, because of the salt, caffeine, sugar, and because 16 FL Oz is just too much to drink at one time.",3
After taste is rough. Its barely okay at best. I wouldn't buy it again. Search for other sugar free syrups.,2
"I recently ordered both the beef and chicken Minor's All Natural Bases. This chicken base is out of this world good! To me, it tastes like just-roasted chicken.<br /><br />The beef is really good, too, although not quite as good as the chicken. I plan to order the vegetable base soon.",5
"I recently ordered this because I was excited about the reduced plastic in the packaging. Interestingly, the day I ordered it my husband came home with the same brand from the grocery store, so I've now tried 2 different flavors. I would give both the same review. The coffee is okay. It's not horrendous, as some people seem to imply, and its not amazing either. The smell is good and smells like nice fresh coffee when you open the box. The flavor is nice enough too. I also love super strong coffee. I drink Revv, Jet Fuel, Wake Up Call, etc. I would not say that this coffee rivals them, but it is stronger than some other medium roast coffees.<br /><br />Big reasons why I wouldn't give this 5 stars:<br /><br />1) The coffee gets very watered down when brewed on a larger cup size. I usually do the 10 oz size and this coffee just doesn't cut it for that. I feel it becomes more like coffee flavored water at that point. 8 oz is better, but its ideal at 6 oz. So, now I just save it for when I want a small cup.<br /><br />2) There is a strange film that brews with the coffee. You can see it floating on top and it sticks to the sides of the mug when you tilt it, so there is like a ring of residue that gets left around the edge where the coffee moved away. You can also see it as darker specks floating on top after you add creamer. I don't know what this is. I have no other coffee that does this. It doesn't really change the taste or texture or anything, but I just don't like it.<br /><br />I think the packaging is a big plus though. I am not sure why the cups being open is such an issue for people. I just put all mine in a zip lock bag (that I can just keep reusing) to keep it air tight. It's really not that difficult. Plus I think it's important to cut down on plastic waste.<br /><br />So all in all, I do plan to buy this coffee again. I like that I can reduce waste and I like it enough that its good for a midday refresher since it has to be a small cup. We are also on a tight budget so that helps as well. However, I don't see myself replacing all my coffee with it, because I want a much larger and stronger cup of coffee in the morning and brewing two of these eliminates both the value and the positive aspects of less waste.",3
"Gerber has an amazing line of products for babies and toddlers, but this product is a miss.  The Wagon Wheels are extremely hard.  They do not dissolve at all in the mouth.  I had hoped they would be similar to the puffs Gerber makes (only larger), but they are nothing like them.  We had to toss these.  I was scared my child would hurt her teeth or choke.",1
"Yes I ordered 5 boxes of 24ct pecan turtles but,<br />what was shipped was 10 boxes of Pecan and Cashew turtles.<br />I E-mailed back asking why they substituted without my approval and their response was: our website clearly stated that the turtles were a combination of Pecan and Cashew turtles.<br />Needless to say, I am not happy about it and future orders will go to someone else.<br />John",1
"The cookie part is ok, but the filling is not good at all. It is dry and splinters apart when bitten into. The taste is barely noticeable and then all of a sudden there is an odd chemical frosting taste. *sigh* I will continue searching for a gluten free cookie, but have resigned myself to the fact that I will have to cook most everything from scratch from now on. On the bright side, it will certainly make me plan ahead better and a more inventive cook.",2

"As a general rule I gravitate toward heavy bodied, dark coffees but rules are made to be broken. From time to time even I bring home a medium blend to break things up. I was quite excited to give Marley Coffee a try but found that a name can't make up for a yucky cup.<br /><br />As lovely as the idea behind this particular line of coffees is I found it lacked the body I look for in a cup of coffee. That said the taste was so pleasant and delicate I actually tossed a couple of the pods into my tea pot and used them like tea bags. The result was actually delicious but far more tea-like than I would pay for in a coffee pod.<br /><br />If you enjoy lighter roasts or prefer tea I would definitely recommend the One Love Organic Coffee pods. Otherwise I would suggest a pass.",2

"When I saw this tea offered in the Vine newsletter, I quickly clicked ""send""...not for myself, but for my daughter, who has a penchant for white and jasmine teas.  This one seemed made for her.  Turns out it was, and here's what she had to say:<br /><br />""...good flavor for a white tea, smooth and soft, the jasmine is a light flavor with a relaxing aroma.  Not overpowering like some teas.  Note: make sure not to steep for too long or use too much tea for one cup otherwise it will give a strong and bitter taste.""<br /><br />To be fair to the product, the star rating we gave it is my daughter's opinion.<br /><br />I do need to caution folks, if you are more of a unflavored tea kind of person, this tea will probably NOT be, well, your cup of tea.  I found the aroma of the tea itself, even before steeping, to be sickly sweet and overwhelming.  If you don't know if you like jasmine teas, don't order this one in bulk - you may regret it.  If you are a jasmine aficionado, than this one will please your palate.",4

"This decaf is a tad anemic and has a bit of a burnt edge to it which may produce a slight aftertaste. If made in a press pot you may find you need to increase the amount of beans, or increase the steeping time to make it richer, elsewise it will may be rather pedestrian and thin. I would not describe this product as rich or robust, however it is not poor either. Experimenting with amount of beans (probably require a tad more than usual) and/or setting time (give it an extra minute or two) may make this a bit more satisfying cup.",3
So far very good except for 2 tins that when opened were somewhat rancid and had a strong smell. Maybe from shipping damage. The others are fine and I will buy again.,3
"Fantastic coffee.  Here's my trouble -- and it's very likely that it is MY trouble alone: I don't know how to make a cup of good, strong coffee using these tea-bag sort of coffee packets and a regular coffee machine.  I find that if you put these packets into the bottom of the coffee filter basket and run water through it, the water runs through too fast and the coffee is too weak.  I have tried using these like actual teabags, which definitely makes a better cup of coffee, but requires a little more time and supervision than I want.  I presume that the right kind of machine, or the right style of coffeemaking, turns these packets into solid gold for ease of use; for me, though, not so much.  But yeah: seriously tasty coffee, once you get the right amount of coffee-ness in your hot water.",3
"I actually had bad effects using this tea.  I was given it by a friend and was unaware of its medicinal properties (so was my friend, fyi).  Within 15 minutes I was starting to get paranoid and less socially apt, and started to feel distant from everything which was going on.  Before long, I was also tending towards depression (which I've experienced before while on birth control, so I caught the signs of it).  I also felt like fainting at a few points.  The effects did go away within about 5 hours.  This was after drinking only a quarter of a mug of it.<br /><br />These are actually the same reactions I had to two different varieties of the birth control pill.  So, if you've reacted badly to birth control, be warned that you may also react badly to this tea.  Or, you may be lucky in that it will not affect you.  Take care if you do try it, and good luck!",2

"I've been eating gluten free for almost four years after my diagnosis with Celiac disease.  At least half that time I've eaten one of these bars for breakfast every morning.  I love them, and I find they provide a nice balance of taste and nutrition to satisfy me through lunch.  I use subscribe and save and have two boxes delivered every month; sometimes I add a third if I'm traveling.  They make great emergency lunches or snacks for traveling abroad, as well.  Last time I left the States for three weeks, I took three boxes... I didn't eat them all myself, but it was reassuring to know that I would always have an emergency meal if I couldn't find something GF.",5
"One Love is a good, robust coffee - if you like a strong coffee in the morning, you should like the flavor. Honestly, I didn't really catch the hints of exotic floral and berry they advertise which is just as well as I enjoy a basic coffee. The single serving pods are handy but you can also use a couple in a regular machine and it works just fine as well. If you're environmentally concious, it is free trade certified and organic.  Partial proceeds are also donated to the charity kicksforcause.org.  Overall an enjoyable cup of coffee with decent flavor.",3
Country of origin is part of my decision making process.  I am posting this for others who may have similar concerns.,3
I found this in the organic aisle at my local supermarket.  $[...] for one box of 100 opposed to 3 boxes being sold here with no shipping or waiting.  I would just like to know if anyone knows if this is a good quality for being a bagged tea.  I'm not a Pu-erh expert and I am looking for something as authentic as I can get without paying an arm and a leg.  Can anyone suggest a good quality??  The only reason I gave this a 3 is because it is something you can find at your supermarket without buying a pack of 3.,3

Wow! I bought this recently and I can't believe how much salt is in this vinegar.<br />2 teaspoons contain 1050mgs of sodium ..<br />The plums are picked in brine before vinegar is made.<br /><br />Way to much salt for me.<br /><br />I would like to have seen the ingredient/nutrition label prior to buying.,1

I like the option to receive a bag per month on ""subscribe and save"" from Amazon..Great deal..best food!",5

"""2% Kopi Luwak""  That's the key part in the description of this fake Kopi Luwak coffee.  For my money, 2% might as well be 0%.  Basically they have taken ordinary coffee beans, which may or may not be good beans to begin with, and put in 00.16 ounces of Kopi Luwak beans per pound.  That means this bag contains about 00.30 ounces of Kopi Luwak as it's a 200 gram bag.  My point?  Drinking a cup of this is not drinking a cup of Kopi Luwak, but just a very expensive cup of normal coffee, period.  Amazon should be ashamed to be selling this.  Enjoy your fake Kopi Luwak coffee.",1
"I usually love Kashi's products, but this one is not good at all.  I LOVE dark chocolate and I LOVE coconut, so I thought these were going to be pretty much the best thing ever.  As soon as I got them home, I opened one to try it.  I was sadly disappointed in both the chocolate and coconut taste of this bar.  The so-called ""dark chocolate"" is a paste-like frosting that, being chocolate, obviously should taste good, but has a weird texture that makes it gross.  I was thinking it was going to be like a layer of actual chocolate, similar to the layer of chocolate on the bottom of Kashi's Go-Lean Crunch bars (which are totally yummy), not chocolate flavored frosting on the top of the granola bar.  Second, these do NOT taste like coconut at all.  There is a sprinkling of dried coconut on the top of the nasty frosting, but you can't even taste it, mostly because the chocolate-y taste of the paste, uh, I mean frosting overwhelms it.  My kids won't even eat them and they will eat anything with frosting on it.  Actually, I guess now I have to say they will eat ALMOST anything with frosting on it.  I would skip these in favor of ANY OTHER Kashi granola bar.  Don't waste your money, unless you like to eat paste and have always been searching for a chocolate flavored paste (with a sprinkling of coconut) to smear on a granola bar.",1
"I have trouble getting to sleep, and many nights wake up several times. This tea has valerian in it, which is a proven herbal relaxer. This tea not only tastes great, but makes me drowsy as well.  I've found it most effective when I let it brew for about 5 minutes, take it to bed with me and sip on it while I read something relaxing.  If I don't drink it before I go to bed, I definitely brew a cup when I wake in the middle of the night.  Then it helps me get back to sleep.<br />I keep several boxes on hand, because I never want to run out of it!",5

"Better than expected, but the peppermint flavor lacks a mint smell or taste. This is a good purchase for the price.",4
I expected a more spicy product. I used as an additive as specified in our local paper recipe section.,2
"The flavor is almost entirely ginger.  It is barely sweetened and not at all lemony.  I really liked it but I don't think the rest of my family would.  The others would have put a couple of spoons of sugar and a big squeeze of lemon in it. (they like ginger-flavored hot lemonade.)<br />The flavor is much the same as slicing a couple of quarter sized slices of ginger into a cup, adding hot water, and mashing it a bit.  Then add one of those tiny scoops of stevia, or a few drops of stevia extract.<br />This product is a nice alternative for when you don't room in your pocket for ginger root and a knife. Honestly I will probably buy some for sick days.  I lived in Cambodia and the grocery shelves were always stocked with at least 6 brands of ginger drink so I do have an appropriate background to judge.  This product is at least equal to the best of them.<br /><br />Unfortunately it was not a very satisfactory trial. We were sent only one packet from the box, so there was no listing of ingredients or nutritional information.  So I can't say how many carbs and how much sugar is included.  Yes, honey is nice but honey is made of sugar, sugar, and sugar.  Many of us really need to know how much.<br /><br /> I also have to vent, and this is probably not the company that produced it, but an Amazon employee - the single packet, the size of a tea bag, was sent in a 12x18x6 inch cardboard box with six yards of bubble wrap.  Shame.",4

"I believe that people need to be aware of the fact that the kibble size of the Adult Oral Care Dry Cat Food is VERY large and presents a potential choking hazard to their pets.  I transitioned my cat to this food from the Science Diet kitten formula when he was about 15 months old.  From day one, I thought that the kibble size was abnormally large for cat food.  I've had cats for over twenty years, and have used many different cat food formulas.  Never have I seen one with kibble this large.  It is close to marble sized.  It was so large that my cat would take one piece out of his bowl at a time to eat it.<br /><br />Even though I was concerned, I was naive enough to think that Hill's would not manufacture a food that could in any way harm a person's pet as Science Diet is highly recommended by many vets.  I was terribly wrong.  About a month after transitioning to this formula, I watched in horror as my beautiful little oriental shorthair stood choking after a piece of kibble got stuck in his mouth.  For anyone who has ever witnessed this, it is a horrible sight.  The poor little cat will pant and paw at the side of their face - as if they want to reach their paw into their mouth, but can't.  I was extremely fortunate - as my boy was finally able to expel the piece of kibble from his mouth, which of course came out whole. I immediately threw the remainder of the food in the trash can.  As painful as it was to watch, I considered it a warning.  Had I not been home to witness the scene, it could have easily happened again with far more dire consequences.<br /><br />I subsequently wrote to Hill's about my concern that this food presented a choking risk and received the most ridiculous and uncaring response that you can possibly imagine.  First they felt compelled to tell me that this particular formula was designed to maintain oral care and that they had a different formula for adult cats.  This was completely insulting as I was very much aware of that fact and had intentionally purchased the food for the stated oral care benefits.  In addition, the fact that they have other formulas has nothing to do with the concern I have with this particular formula.  Next they asked if I ""transitioned"" my cat to the new food, in what I can only interpret as a lame attempt at trying to make me feel as if I was somehow responsible for the situation.  Short of putting the food into a blender, there would be no other appropriate way of ""transitioning"" one's pet to avoid the risk of choking on this product.<br /><br />I don't for one minute believe that my cat's experience was an isolated occurence.  If you are thinking about buying this product, please, please, please be aware of the risk as it is VERY real.",1
"I am in the health food industry and I am gluten intolerant.  I have tried many different GF cookies in the last ten years.  I bought a box of Lucy's chocolate chip cookies last night at Safeway.  I was not impressed.  The cookie was dry, almost to the point of being stale. This is a common problem when people try to make a gluten free cookie that have no experience in baking with gluten free flours.  Lucy's cookies remind me of Pamela's cookies which are also dry.  Being dry is not a sin that a little milk or coffee can not take care of.  However what I cannot stand is an after taste.  The base flour combination has an odd after taste that spoiled the little enjoyment I had from this cookie.  I looked at the ingredients and found garbonzo and fava bean flours.  I cannot recommend this cookie based upon the after taste.  I have not tried the other varieties that may have stronger flavors to cover up the after taste.  I would suggest either Udi's frozen cookies or Glutino cookies.  I find these two brands superior to Lucy's.  Thanks for reading.",2

"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 7:08 Mins<br /><br /></span>It really depends on many factors, so experiences will vary.  I think you will likely find varying degrees of success, not complete eradication.  If you have multiple pests, then you will probably deter some of them, in which you find 2-4 star reviews.  Or if you have one pest, whether or not it works on that one determines 1 or 5 star reviews.  I am happy with the products attempt to deter and isn't a gimmick, but the value will depend on your level of success.  Based on many reviews, clearly success varies.  At least this 5-lb shaker seems to last longer than the smaller cans at the local store.<br /><br />So it is really just a big can of pepper, mostly black pepper and cayenne pepper which are two of the 3 active ingredients.  Peppers smell and taste unpleasant to animals.  Whether this blend and processing are the perfect solution and cost effectiveness versus wholesale black and cayenne pepper depends.  It isn't a fence or barrier, just a deterrent to make it more unpleasant than the next alternative location for the animal which will hopefully move on and do its business elsewhere.  But you will be fighting against (1) habits that might take time to break, (2) areas previously marked by animals or other droppings that are more attractive that offset or overpower this, (3) if yours is still the least unpleasant alternative to limited or worse options, (4) the animal's sensitivity to taste and smell of this deterrent, and (5) how fast it gets washed away and perform at reduced levels.  You could have an old dog that has lost much of its sense of smell and has been using your lawn for ages and has marked the area that probably would be less deterred to change.  Or a cat's habit and previous droppings might overpower this product.<br /><br />This is similar to you going to the beach.  Suppose rocks litter one side of the beach along with a dead fish that washed up on shore and smells a little.  It doesn't stop you from walking through there, it is just unpleasant to setup your towel or walk around over there.  But you might walk through it to find better sands elsewhere.  But you would prefer to walk to the side of the beach that is sandy with a fresh air breeze.  Your yard is the beach to the pests.  You are just trying to make it less desirable.",3

Well golly gee willikers - sign me up!<br /><br />Pretty much the only people buying this item are people who like Reese's and believe deep down that a naked Reese's cup is a happy Reese's cup. Why go and sully such delicious peanut butter by covering it in milk, dark, and white chocolates? Enter this product, which had such huge potential to make me so very fat and happy. Alas, for it has gone and made me of a sadder type of person. When I opened the box, I wasted no time in unscrewing the lid and peeling off the safety film, and in I dove with a spoon fit for a king. Unfortunately that spoon had the gall not to warn me it wasn't true Reese's peanut butter, but standard peanut butter, and in it went.<br /><br />I frantically turned to the ingredients looking for that one special ingredient that would have made it all right... There's Roasted Peanuts, Sugar, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Salt, Peanut Oil, Monoglycerides, Molasses, Cornstarch, and ... um ... nothing else. -sigh- My taste buds were right; That one ingredient that I was looking for wasn't there: Magic.<br /><br />As peanut butter goes, it's average creamy peanut butter. Good on toast with grape preserves, on crackers with honey, and on thighs. That's about it. For its' averageness I will give it 1 stars where I would otherwise give it 0.

I liked Corn Crunchems better before they re-formulated them.  They now are kind of like eating straw with corn flavoring.  I used to eat them every morning--not any more.,3

"Last summer, our family discovered <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CC734G"">Izze Sparkling Juice Variety Pack - 12/12 Oz Btls</a> and used them for special treats on really hot days. They were refreshing and because they did not add any sugar we could fool ourselves into thinking they were healthy (they are healthier...)<br /><br />When we saw Switch, we thought we might be getting even more of the same in new flavors.  Unfortunately, these are more syrupy than the Izzy's.  At least for adults, the are less crisp and refreshing.  However, kids would of course prefer these as they are sweeter.<br /><br />We also tried Watermelon/Strawberry and we liked the Kiwi Berry better.  The watermelon/Strawberry had a much more Jolly Rancher like taste. I think we are going to stick to our Izzy's I think.",3
"I ordered this Staghorn Fern for my brother's birthday. It arrived at his Brooklyn apartment and he hung it in his bathroom. The next day he walks into his bathroom...to find a little lizard!!....and the next day....another lizard!!!<br />He had nowhere to keep them and they ""escaped"". He was going to buy a little tank to keep them in, but they disappeared from their temporary housing.<br />I let the company know to do a better check of the ferns before they are sent...this was definitely not what I expected. (I had a good laugh about it - but I don't think my brother did!)",2
"I love the 18 Rabbits Brand granola because it is the lowest carb granola I could find, is made with whole ingredients, has a nice texture, and great flavor.  This particular variety is not my favorite because the dried cherries are so hard that they are nearly impossible to chew. I highly recommend all of the other varieties of granola. My favorite is the Gracious granola <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DQYC"">18 Rabbits Gracious Granola, Organic (pecan, almond and maple), 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> It is made in small batches here is San Francisco and is very expensive, it is nice to save a few buck on amazon subscribe and save.",3
"Wonderful coffee. I have tried many different k-cups, and like Goldilocks, I found some to be to strong, some to be too weak, but this one is just right. No bitterness, no acidity, just pure coffee taste. I enjoy flavored coffees but sometimes just want a plain old coffee, and this is THE ONE for me. After having experimented with many others, I will stick with this one.",5
"Disgusting!  I have never tasted anything more awful.  I went along with the other reviews and thought that I would try this product.  I have tried other products from this maker and enjoyed everything.  However, this apple cider smelled and tasted awful.  So if anyone is considering this item, think twice before you buy.",1
I wanted this to be good.  It was alright. A tad bit grainy and overly sweet.  I failed to see the sugar listed on the label. I would not have bought it knowing that.,2

"These bars are great - and I am not even particularly fond of cranberries. They are not overly sweet (I can't quite stomach chocolate early in the morning), but provide a good, solid start to the day. They are my favorite breakfast bar right now, and for those who do like cranberries, you will love these.",5
"I'm obsessed with pumpkin pie. I can have it any day at any time of the day. When I saw these pop tarts I thought, ""whoa, pumpkin pie in a pop tart? No way. This has to taste really good."" But to my surprise, it wasn't as great as I thought it would. Too sweet. I'm sure because of the frost on top. But, it killed the taste for me.",3
"To sum this product up with one word it would be SALTY, but its not like the salty taste that I am use to the ammonium cloride in the product give it an ammonia flavor.  I have had the taste of the one piece that I ate in my mouth for several hours now, even after drinking some pop and going to lunch its still there.<br /><br />Please advise, even if you are adventurous DO NOT TRY!!! Only try this if you are use to ammonium cloride, if you are not, it will be one of the worst tasting things you will ever run accross.",1

"My dog loves the big pieces, but, there are so few of them I am not sure if I should try this brand again. The pieces are for the most part tiny throw outs in a lot of dust. The few bigger pieces my dog LOVES. I don't know if they are made  wrong,  or packed wrong, or just handled VERY badly in shipping, but they are NOT worth the money in the condition that they arrive in.",2
"As a soup lover who doesn't have enough time to regularly make batches of homemade soups, but who is not satisfied with either the ingredients or nutritional value of most canned soups (not to mention the horrificly high sodium levels), I'm always trying to make simple soups in one or two-serving sizes on the fly using packaged stocks (chicken or vegetable).<br /><br />It's very easy for me to add some steamed veggies (or beans) and seasonings to low-sodium chicken stock and then quickly heat and whirr (with my electric hand blender) up a healthy and tasty soup course. The only problem has been that I often did not want or need to use 32-ounces of the stock (the size of most aseptic packaged soup stocks) at one time. Although once opened, these 32-ounce packages can stay usable for maybe 10 days after opening, I still found myself throwing the unused contents out. Wasteful.<br /><br />These individually packaged small (8-ounce) sizes allow you to make just enough for a serving or two (depending on appetite) without waste. (Yes, you're paying a bit more in a cost-per-ounce comparison, but this is about convenience and avoiding waste.)<br /><br />Since I'm always adding my own seasonings (in dried or fresh form), the base flavor is not that important. In fact, I prefer a ""neutral"" or blandish stock so that it doesn't dominate the soup I""m making. I'm not saying this stock is tasteless, but if you're not used to low-sodium stock you're not gonna like any brand of it. (I use store generic brands as well as Pacific which I find tasty enough to heat up alone and sip if needed, especially in the winter. But again this is a stock and the base for building something. Not something that has a pronounced ""taste/flavor"" of its own. You will however, know that it is chicken and not vegetable stock.)<br /><br />Since I use chicken stock to flavor a lot of other dishes (including sauteed  vegetables) instead of oils and butter, having small amounts available to use as needed is both convenient and cost-effective. (I would never use those horrible chicken boullion cubes and the only other alternative, a fairly tasty powdered mix from Vogue, is just too expensive in dry form and hard to find.)<br /><br />That the stock is organic is a big plus. That does matter to me.<br /><br />If you are not cooking for a crowd, but rather for one or two, and use chicken stock for soups or in other foods, these are something you'll want to keep on hand.<br /><br />FYI: They are hard to find in stock locally and are more expensive than amazon. It's another convenience and cost saver to be able to order them online.",4
"I can't believe these are sold here.  Just like my childhood memories, too!  A gourmet market in my hometown of Lake Placid sold them when I was little.  I found them again many years ago while vacationing in St. Maarten.  I'm so excited to find them again!",4
"This product (as you can see in the photos) has 41 grams of carbs. 5 of those are fiber which can be subtracted from the total carb count, but there's 36 grams remaining!<br /><br />If you're serious about keeping your carbs down this is not for you. There's a good reason why this tastes like regular pasta.... IT IS!!<br /><br />Try Atkins or Carbanada, those are both low carb at under 7grams.",1
"We have purchased this product before from the same seller (AWORLDOFPUPS) and received a wonderful dog treat that was soft enough to break into multiple treat size pieces. My puppies absolutely loved them. We ordered another batch when we quickly ran out and this time we received very hard, dry sticks that would snap in half with a great deal of pressure but did not appear to be safe enough for my 20lb puppies to eat. We did give them one half of a treat each and were amazed at how LONG it took them to chew threw this small piece of treat. These are dogs that usually can chew through anything quite quickly. I held off writing a negative review until I heard back from the company. However their policy is that I must pay for the shipping on the return and I can not return anything opened. After numerous emails back and forth they appear to be unconcerned (at least they have not commented on) the fact that this particular bag appears to be defective and unsafe for consumption. The lamination on the bag itself arrived peeling. Upon closer inspection the product is made in China so the lack of quality control is not surprising, however the lack of concern and willingness to take responsibility by the seller is. We will be looking for new treats elsewhere. We are very disappointed; the first batch we received was great. I'm giving two stars instead of one because the first bag was fantastic as were the other treats in the same collection.",2

I can't necessarily blame the product but my dog sniffed this and wouldn't even pick it up.  Looks like I'll be donating the other box I bought to his dog friends in the hopes that they will eat it.,1
"Recommended by our first Veterinarian.  A little pricey, but well worth it -the dog LOVES them and does not have bad breath or plaque build up.",5
"This tea has a great taste for those of you who love vanilla. It's not over powering but a nice hint of it. I'm not sure how to write this review, because it is tea. If you enjoy tea, you'd enjoy this... if you're looking for energy, go drink coffee or an energy drink. That's my 2 cents on this tea.",3
"This Zico product taste very nice as discrib but the only thing let this product down in my eyes is the packing. the packing is very sloppy. from the top where company put white whole for pour there is the seal between white plastic and blue cover, from there water is coming out actually it leaked little bit in my box too. so thats not good at all I checked my all 6 container and all have same problem all are leaking from same place.",4
"These dental chews are both a great treat for your dog as well supposedly helping with tartar buildup.  My dog, who is normally picky with treats, devoured these.  Being a fifty pound dog, it's also the perfect size for her -- not bulky like some rawhides (which she detests) and not too small like some treats.  One per evening was sufficient for her.<br /><br />My only knock on these is they are a bit pricey.  There are comparable products available priced a few dollars less.  If the price is reasonable to the consumer, I'd definitely recommend trying them as a healthy treat for your dog.",4
"Heads up to all of you out there who love Mrs. Mays.  I too love their products and was a regular customer. I liked the simplicity of ingredients, the fact that most of them were ""organic"" and that they were Vegan. I purchased a case of various items from them directly, and imagine my surprise when I noticed the box they arrived in said ""A Product of China."" I emailed them and they confirmed that their product is indeed produced in China. Having traveled in China, and, based on recent problems related to products made in China, I am no longer buying Mrs. Mays. How anyrhinf grown there could be described as ""organic"" strikes me as disingenous at best. The energy required to ship the product back to the US also strikes me as wasteful. I no longer purchase their product. When they produce their products with locally grown, organic ingredients, I'll be back!",2
"This had a nice, tart cherry flavor, but it was too sweet for me. Otherwise, I thought this was refreshing and I liked the fizzy-ness.<br /><br />It had a slight aftertaste (metallic?) when I drank it out of the can. I thought that it tasted much better in a glass.<br /><br />It's nice to see a healthier alternative to soda, and I'll definitely try the other flavors.<br /><br />Ironically, I think this would be tasty as a mixer in an alcoholic beverage, which pretty much defeats the purpose of drinking something healthy.",3

"So I'm on a real tight budget but love hummus and I'm not good at making my own. Casbah dried hummus actually tastes a lot like premade and at a fraction of the price. I will agree there's a little bit of a chemical lemon taste, but when you mix in your own flavorings it's negligible (I like roasted garlic, olive oil, roasted red peppers, jalapenos, salsa, etc.). All in all I'm very pleased with the product, and even with shipping costs less than half of its premade competitors!",4
"These taste really good, and a lot of people could use more of the ""B"" vitamins, but it's only 33% of your RDA of vitamin ""B"". ""B"" vitamins are not easily absorbed by the body,  and usually to make any difference at all you need mega doses if they're taken orally. 33% is pretty much non-existent in terms of absorption, from what I've read.<br />I didn't notice any energy boost from the pack I ate, but that's the way vitamins are, if you need them, it's very very bad if you don't get them, but if you don't need them, you're just making expensive urine.<br />When my Dad had dementia, one of the things they tested for was ""B"" vitamin deficiency, that wasn't what caused his, but it's scary to think that not getting enough of just one vitamin could have been the culprit in something as severe as his dementia.<br />If it doesn't make a difference, you probably aren't deficient or the amount of vitamin is too small and it wasn't absorbed and you won't really get an ""energy boost."" The product is kind of misleading in claiming that.<br />It tastes good, it's nice candy, the vitamin ""C"" probably gets absorbed and the sugar will give you a rush, but I wouldn't count on this for vitamin ""B"", you need shots or a mega dose supplement for that.<br />I'd read up on ""B"" vitamins before buying these, they're expensive and I really doubt their efficacy. If you need ""B"" don't mess around, get shots and don't count on a candy to help you.",3

"Kitchens of India's Bav Bhaji/Mashed Vegetables is deliciously spicy and savory,but it shouldn't stand alone. It's best paired with naan (bread) or rice. To add some zip, one can use freshly chopped vegetables. It's good for people aiming at a healthy,plant-based diet. By itself,it's like instant oatmeal,with a baby food consistency.<br /><br />An extra benefit is the hourlong CD of Indian classical music by sarod master Ustad Amjad Ali Khan. The music is savory... and needs no accompaniment!",3
"I will preface this review by saying that I was positively disposed towards the company before trying their coffee.  They are doing a lot of things right.  The coffee is fair trade and organic certified, roasted in small batches, and the company has started a non-profit organization ""kicks for a cause,"" a group which engages children in soccer to contribute to a healthy lifestyle.  Personally I do not really go for using the name of someone who is unable to choose whether or not they would endorse the product, but that said, their hearts and conscience seem to be in the right place.  The coffee, however (in my opinion) is not very good.  I am saying this as a huge fan of African coffees (my personal favorite) and as one who goes well out of her way to procure same (since it is scarce in the Hawaiian islands, and expensive to bring in).  I have reviewed several other yirgacheffes which I have purchased here.  I would say that this particular brand is among the worst: bitter and completely lacking in the distinctive notes for which yirgacheffe is known.  Among the coffees I have reviewed on Amazon, I would say that the Coffee Masters roast <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6O5W0"">Coffee Masters Gourmet Coffee, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> is the best, followed by equal exchange <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5UJW"">Equal Exchange Organic Coffee, Ethiopian, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> and then Marley and Coffee Bean direct. (None as good as Green Mountain, Trader Joes, or several small roasters).<br />It is too bad.  I would like to see companies like this one become successful, as they are doing a lot of good things in the world and their community.  but, in all honesty, this particular coffee is not very good.",3

"I purchased these to use as advertised, e.g., in the kitchen, but find them to be ridiculously worthless.  In fact, I purchased these bags nearly two years ago and am using it now only because I ran out of my regular garbage bags (Green Pride: strong, doesn't begin degrading in the kitchen garbage can in one day...).  I recalled these bags being weak, but had entirely forgotten how frustratingly weak.  I couldn't even get it around the bin liner!  It tore instantly when I gave it the slightest tug!  Not only did it instantly tear, the tear proceeded more than half way down the bag before I'd realized what had happened.  I then recalled that these bags began degrading after only a couple of days.  We compost a lot and use a full 13 gallon kitchen bin, but these bags are not meant for even half of that.  If you put food scraps or moist garbage into these bags, the bags will begin breaking down immediately.  Within a couple of days, the bag had disintegrated and we were left to wash out the bin.  These bags are only good as doggy poop bags for people with 3 foot long hands.",1
"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.",1
"First, I expected this to be like dry jerky.  This was wet and soggy with a spongy texture.  There is something so off putting about the flavor, it's like wet dog food.  The first bite seemed okay, but I could not finish it even though it was small.  Regretfully, I decided to buy this anyway based on the reviews... I read all the one star reviews and thought ""Heyyyy now, it can't be that bad! These people must be clueless. they must be expecting it to taste like real jerky, of course it's not!""  I was soooo wrong.",1
"Good stuff for a cold evening! It is one of our favorite K-cups, especially when we want something different from our standard coffee.",5
I bought this coffee based on all the positive reviews and the significantly cheaper price than my usual brand.  I find this coffee lacking any Hazelnut Creme flavor.  Perhaps the lack of flavor is due to the fine grind?  Needless to say I will not be purchasing this coffee again.,1

But if that's the case, I might as well buy the cheap nuts at my local Costco. Very disappointed.",2
"This chai has good flavor but needs more black tea leaves to make a fully satisfying cup of tea. It leans on cloves but not overly, to my taste. The Tazo chai has more tea leaves and tastes very good if used properly -- 2 mugs of tea or an extra large mug from each tea bag. I've gotten used to the Stash spicing now (have enjoyed 6 boxes) and like to drink both the Stash and the Tazo (also finished 6 boxes), which I drink straight, in succession, in the morning. Then I switch to decaf Tazo chai which is very good and makes 2 mugs per tea bag.",4
"Initially there was an element of the flavor that seemed to detract from the various chilli peppers that are used in the sauce.

"This gum is a big hit with people who remember this gum from years back, or those that have never seen it.  The fascination of 5 different flavors in a single pack of 17 sticks of gum.

While Sojos is a tasty and natural mix-in that helps my little carnivore miss her meat less, I was disappointed to learn that it has these ingredients in it:<br />1- EGG - is highly allergenic. My dog is allergic to poultry and since this is a poultry product, I'd rather not have this in the formula.<br />2- GARLIC - published as a substance that is toxic to dogs.  My references:  both the ASPCA web site, and the book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0813819857"">Blackwell's Five-Minute Veterinary Consult Clinical Companion: Small Animal Toxicology</a>.  I am including a very short excerpt from the book, ""The Allium species of plants belongs to the Alliacae family and includes onions, garlic, chives, and leeks.  These plants contain propyl disulfides and can cause Heinz body anemia when ingested by companion animals.  Cooking, drying, processing, and spoiling do not negate the toxic effect.  Pets on diets with Allium supplementation (e.g. garlic or onion powder) may be chronically poisoned.""  Detailed info on pages 457-460.  When I learned this, I quickly stopped feeding my dog this product.  This didn't come cheap and that also adds to my disappointment because now it will have to be thrown out.<br /><br />If the manufacturer changes the formula and removes those two ingredients, I might consider buying this product again.",3
"As the title suggested, my cat would not eat these.  They are rather large (about two times the size of an ordinary cat treat) and rubbery in texture.  I cannot attest to the flavour and how palatable it may or may not be to felines.  If your cat is used to ""normal"" treats, these may not go over well.  My cat is extremely difficult to pill, and we have tried basically every last idea known to man on how to get his daily meds into him.  We still have almost a whole package of these in the fridge.<br /><br />All I can say is, good luck.  I guess it all depends on the cat.",1
i have not much to say about this product i bought it for make ice cream but is late for the season  but i ll use for bake,5
"My son has a dachshund that devours slippers like they were after-dinner mints and a Corgie that can inhale a sofa leg in under a minute. These dogs are serious chewers.  Nothing satisfied their chewing needs until we found this.<br /><br />The Everlasting Treat Ball is intended to be used with  Everlasting Treats.  (Follow the instructions on how to insert the Treats.  Some of the reviewers had problems with this and the results were not optimal.)  However, you can put other yummies in the ball.  Peanut butter is great and the dogs will spend hours making sure that every single molecule of the peanut butter is licked out.<br /><br />This toy kept my son's dogs quiet and occupied for up to several days.  (Conversely, my own dogs who are not chewers had absolutely no interest in this product. )<br /><br />The dogs are happy and my son's blood pressure is now down at normal levels.",4
"I like Columbian coffee and this is above average with a good dark color with a nice smell.  The taste is bolder than average but not unpleasant or bitter.  This is my ""strong"" Columbian coffee combining all the good things of the type with a bolder taste.",4
"I have tried many oolong teas and diet teas and do like the flavor of this one.  It helps me feel fuller faster when I drink it before a meal and cures my appitite when I hungry.

"So here I am thinking I'm getting a great tasting cookie with Splenda only to find out they use Hydrogenated Oils.  On top of that they use the worst kind of oil, Palm and Palm Kernel.<br /><br />Don't be fooled into thinking you are getting something Heather because it has no sugar.  I would rather eat a tablespoon of sugar then these cookies.<br /><br />I totally feel this is a misrepresentation!  Shame.",1
It was a great value and I like the package size but not vinegary enough for me. Won't order this brand again. Great chips otherwise.,2
"These hazlenut K Cups have a pleasing, but mild flavor.  Very good overall, but a bit mild for those who prefer stronger coffee.",4
This is not the original formula as the ad states.  It is the new meaty selections formula which both our cats appear to be allergic to.  It is the small flat pieces not the large round bits like they used to be.  Unfortunately the bag was also opened upon delivery so I really couldn't return it.  The local strays got a treat............,2
"I have purchased halva from this company in the past and have received delicious halva on those occasions.  Additionally, because we were happy with the product, the amount of halva we ordered progressively increased until we purchased 5 pounds.<br /><br />Unfortunately, on our latest order of 2 pounds, upon opening the package, we discovered that the halva appeared to have somewhat of a pungent odor.  We then tasted the halva and immediately found it to have a rotten taste.  Upon closer inspection, I discovered that the halva had possibly come in contact with moisture or that the halva sent was dated.  I began the inquiry process and explained the incident with Parthenon foods.  I was shocked and dismayed when they sent me the following reply (verbatim):<br /><br />""Hello,<br />We are sorry, but this item is not old and very fresh.  Are you referring to the package being a little oily, which would be normal?  Halva is not perishable and can not be ""rotten"" This product is very fresh and perfect to consume.<br />Sincerely,<br />ParthenonFoods.com""<br /><br />I laughed out loud due to their statement, ""this item is not old and very fresh"", which essentially admits their item is not very fresh!  Pretty funny huh?  Anyways, they were not willing to rectify the issue, even though we spent a considerable amount of money on their product on numerous occasions.<br /><br />Fortunately, the outstanding service of Amazon came through as always, and they themselves rectified the issue by reimbursing me the full amount.  I then of course spent the same amount on a different brand of halva (through Amazon of course!)<br />I will never purchase food items from Parthenon foods again, bad customer service, unwillingness to rectify situation, prompt destruction of good will.  At least they were honest about the halva being ""...not old and very fresh""...!",1
Excellent coffee and one of the best Keurig cup bargains there is I will buy more of this product and no plastic bottoms,5
First let me say I am a huge fan of endangered species chocolate.  This is my first time however trying this particular mixture.  I love orange and chocolate as a combination but this one definitely falls short.  Unfortunately from what I can gather and the type of bitterness it is I am guessing they add too much of the pith while creating the orange oil.  It has a smooth delightful start but the more you eat the more pronounced the bitter taste becomes.  I am disappointed by the purchase and will not order this type again.,2
"At first my son loves it but when he tried other baby food he doesn't like this anymore . I think it's the sourness of the apricot that he's not fond of. Earths best should sell a variety so it is easier for us,moms, to feed our children. I was worried that we had to throw about six jars.",3
I moved from Wellness to halo for my cats and dogs. They can't be happier! and I'm a happy mom!<br /><br />I give them dry and can food. I prefer the grain free recipe for the cats.,5
"I was expecting something a little more snappy and a little less sandy. The flavor was okay (I personally love strong ginger flavors, which I am yet to find) however, they were too sweet for my tastes. I don't know, but it seems like Americans have a strong taste for excess sugar. It would have been better if there was less sugar and more spice, as well as less sandiness and more snappiness, imho. For those who like chocolate, try the extreme chocolate cookies, but be careful as they may cause burning of the stomache; esp. if many are eaten. Not my favorite Pamela's product.",2
"Okay.  I have to admit that I usually don't eat processed/pre-packaged foods.  However, I was desperate for something for lunch and picked something that looked halfway decent.  After picking myself up off the floor after looking at the sodium content, I decided to just go for it.  I would just limit my sodium intake at dinner this evening.  I only used half of the teriyaki (?) sauce and my lips are still puckered.  There are so few veggies in the dish that I don't know why they even bothered to put them in there in the first place.<br /><br />Never, ever again.  I'll stick with Amy's instead of Annie's.",1
"Be warned, your first one you make a face that says it is nasty as all.  After that, the taste grows on you, and is tolerable at best.  I recommend you try other flavors, like cola or orange.  The carbonated flavors are much better tasting and much more refreshing.",3
I got this product on time and it was packaged just as described. This cinnamon had a wonderful aroma and it is really a lot for a home cook..I am happy with my purchase.,5
"I received my pouch as part of a birthday gift basket from my parents.  Problem is my birthday isn't until November 29th.  I just so happen to be home when the Amazon delivery arrived and opened the box expecting it to be my own order ... only to find delicious Jelly Beans!  Early Birthday present win!  Anyhow, onto the review!!<br /><br />Jelly Belly Jelly Beans are easily my favorite snack food on the planet.  These little beans come in a wide variety of flavors, 49 for this 2-pound pouch.  Flavors such as: Green Apple, Mango, Raspberry, Red Apple, Plum, Kiwi, Peach, Coconut ... and Wild Flavors like: Buttered Popcorn, Bubble Gum, Dr. Pepper, French Vanilla, Toasted Marshmallow.  The pouch has a guide telling you what each jelly bean flavor is, and looks like.  Often included with gift box / sampler varieties of Jelly Belly is a small card that tells you how to make flavor combos to enhance your Jelly Bean experience.  A prime example wouldbe  Very Cherry.  By itself it is a very rich - cherry flavor.  However take 1 cherry + 1 Dr. Pepper and you now have  Cherry Dr. Pepper flavor.<br /><br />* POUCH DESIGN *<br />The pouch itself is quite durable and does a decent job when put into a ""standing"" position, however I wouldn't trust it.  Once you start to devour the beans inside the package becomes less and less stable.  The great thing about this package design is that Jelly Belly saw this happening and included a resealable zipper inside the pouch.  This zipper seal is quite durable and passed my spill test; I sealed the pouch then turned it upside-down with all 2-lbs of beans in it over a bowl, then began to shake and try to break the seal.  No failure.<br /><br />* JELLY BEAN QUALITY *<br />Now for the main event, the Jelly Belly's themselves.  The jelly belly's I got were excellent quality as I am used to with the Jelly Belly brand.  There is no comparison between a Jelly Belly bean and a generic jelly bean you find in the supermarket.  Jelly Belly beans are richly flavored, with each flavored bean having a distinct flavor to it.  This isn't just some sugary bean you pop into your mouth and enjoy a sweet treat.  Each tiny bean is packed with flavor, and by having 49 distinct flavors (plus mix n' match combos) the variety makes each portion of jelly beans a flavorful adventure.<br /><br />I will admit that not all the Jelly Bean flavors are my favorite.  I am not a fan of Cappuccino, crushed pineapple, or Strawberry Daiquiri plus I'm mixed on others... But that is what will happen when you have 49 unique flavors.  I will list all the flavors at the end of the review as well as nutritional information in the ""Comment"" section associated with this review.<br /><br />** OVERALL I would give this product 4 stars.  While the jelly beans are outstanding and still continue to be my favorite snack food of all time, it is an expensive product.  This was purchased on sale for about $11 or $5.50/lb (11/14/2011).  In a way that's a pretty decent price for Jelly Belly beans per pound, even when compared to some of the warehouse stores out there, but still very expensive if you compare it to a simple 24oz tin of generic jelly beans at the local supermarket for $2.99.  Despite Jelly Belly beans having a high  ""per pound"" cost, they are worth the asking price in my opinion(I wouldn't pay more than around $7.99/lb though).  The quality is exceptional and the variety of flavors make Jelly Belly beans truly a Gourmet Treat.",4
"The consistency of the chocolate is nice, but the caramel is too chewy and way, way, way over salted.  The ingredients to this candy seem very inconguous and ill matched - and I'm a candy and dessert hound.  I ended up throwing it away, which I almost never do to candy.",1
These are great if you need a quick snack. I usually keep a couple in my purse ya never know when your stuck somewhere and hungry! lol,5
"I am new to sprouting, very new in fact.  I read that buckwheat was a very easy sprout so I bought this organic seed.  Unfortunately, it turns out that this is not the right buckwheat for ""normal"" jar sprouting, this seed is for growing greens/grass and requires that type of sprouter.  This seed has the inedible hull still on it.  I think the description could be a little clearer.  If you want to sprout buckwheat look for hulled buckwheat or ""groats"".  But not toasted buckwheat or 'kasha', obviously that will never sprout, having been cooked.  The only upside is my birds seem to like it a lot so I guess it won't go completely to waste.",3
"The honey tastes great, but unless you really love the taste, the flavor might get a little boring. Other than that, Stinger has the highest calorie count of all other gels out there and it's relatively inexpensive.",4
"I placed an order for 4 separate Kringle's to go to 4 separate addresses.  One of the orders was never sent by the company.  They basically ruined somebody's Christmas gift.  A couple days after Christmas, all I got was an apology and they said they would refund the one Kringle purchase. You'd think they'd do something to make up for their mistake, especially considering how many orders I placed.  Enjoy the money you got from this years Kringle purchase, because it will be the last time I'll ever place an order there.  There are other bakeries that do mail order.  You apparently want my money more than you want my business.",2
"Most of the stick jerkys are good (some of them are quite long), but I found some smaller bagged kinds (not the premium) a bit too salty and not much flavor.  It may just be me because my friend said it tasted fine. Maybe I just got an extra salty batch.<br /><br />The jerky is moist and chewy with some unique flavors (honey stung and pickled sausage come to mind).  For a complete listing of flavors, you can go to Choo Choo R Snacks Inc's website.  This pack contains 50 pieces of 32 different flavors.<br /><br />If you want to get a taste of the different varieties that Buffalo Bills has to offer, this is a great option.  It even came with a free sample of their Supreme Coconut Bar!",4
"Of all the K-Cup flavors that are out there, and there are many very good ones, this is one of my least favorites, and I have tried almost all of them.  Not much flavor to this one, even if you add various types of creamers.  Of course, it is all a matter of taste, but this one doesn't taste all that good.  It is not bad - it is just kind of there - like a generic coffee.  Try something else instead.",3
Stash makes the best Earl Grey tea I have ever had.  It has tremendous flavor and smells wonderful right out of the packet....this tea gets my day started right or is perfect before bed.,5
My husband and I love these. They taste soo good fresh from the microwave. I was pleased to see these as a pack of 18. I can only find 3 packs at my local grocery store and they are not as economical.,5
"This soup ROCKS. Low fat, low calorie and great flavor! I have a bowl of this as my dinner at least once a week. I'm super happy to find it here on Amazon as it is a lot more expensive to buy at the grocery store.",5
STAY AWAY FROM ORDERING FROM THIS COMPANY. I RECEIVED MY ORDER ON TIME BUT TO MY AMAZMENT ALL OF THE COFFEE PODS WERE STAMPED WITH A DATE THAT WAS ABOUT 6 MONTHS PAST DUE.,1
I have gotten this flavor of slim jim before from amazon and loved it however this order tasted like salty cardboard! Expiration date of march 08 but these must have been stored improperly because they are nasty. I guess with amazon your rolling the dice when you order snacks. Sometimes they are good and sometimes they really really bad. Good luck to all who are brave enough to gamble their $$$,1

"I do have to say that the cat food is quite nutritious and appealed to my cat's sense of smell as well as my visual sense.  He also did not throw up this food, which is a rarity for my sensitive-stomached cat.  On the downside, he didn't eat much of it, either.  I don't know what about it didn't interest him beyond a few bites, but most of it got left in his bowl.  My dog, on the other hand, loves it!  I give three stars because it's potentially interesting to other cats, but mine wouldn't eat more than a little bit of it.  I gave some to a friend, and her cats loved it.",3
"I almost did not purchase these because I was not familiar w/ this brand. I took a chance based on Ms. Vega's review and I am so glad I did. They flavor taste as fresh as if you toasted them yourself-crunchy, fresh almond flavor-no rancidity! The foil resealing bag actually seals airtight unlike other bags that do not seal well since they are cheaply made. I will definitely purchase other Azar products. Also this product is actually cheaper than buying non-toasted sliced almonds at my local grocery stores (Food Lion and Farm Fresh). Truly a great deal on a quality item.",5
"Maybe I got the runt of the litter, but when I opened the bag, the foul musty/moldy smell hit me in the face. Even though the label (which was just a printed sticker as opposed to something stamped on the bag itself) said good until 1/2013, there was no doubt that the food had gone bad. Very disappointing.",1
"I don't really have much confidence in any commercial pet food,  but the  ingredient list for Newmans's seems better than most.",3
"I am the queen of alternate, reduced-calorie foods, with an affinity for diet sodas, Splenda sweetener and everything substitutional.  This being the case, I have developed a taste for the artificial.  But even I cannot bear the flavor (and attributing the word flavor is being kind) of this product.  There isn't even a hint of peanut taste.  I took one spoonful and had to spit it right back out.  Even went so far as to try to re-flavor the product with cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar-free maple syrup.  Nothing... absolutely nothing... will make this product edible.  Do not waste your money.  Try PB2 powdered peanut butter instead.  45 calories for 2 tablespoons, but tastes even better than full-fat peanut butter.",1
"I recently read in one of Alice Medrich's books that the best crystallized ginger comes from Down Under, and in that book she recommended Royal Pacific as one of the best brands. Since the publication of that book (1994), Royal Pacific is now known as The Ginger People. (The VERY BEST Australian ginger is produced by Buderim, Queensland, but unfortunately only 3 of their many products are available for sale in the USA.)<br /><br />Prior to trying the Baker's Cut, I had been to Penzey's and tried a small jar of their Australian Ginger (sold under their own brand so I have no idea who supplies it). There is a definite difference between the Penzey's ginger and the Ginger People's Baker's Cut; the Penzeys is noticeably sweeter, and the Baker's Cut has more heat. The ingredients on the Penzeys product is shown as ""Cane sugar, ginger"", whereas on the Baker's Cut is ""Baby ginger, cane sugar"". Since ingredient labels must begin with the highest-proportion ingredient and 'work downward', this isn't surprising.<br /><br />I use the Baker's Cut for cooking and will be finishing up the Penzey's by nibbling. ;-)  Not because the Penzeys is ""better"", but because the Ginger People's product has a flavor that will hold up much better when combined with other ingredients.",5
"Pleasant mixture of fruit tastes and the level of carbonation is refreshing.<br /><br />However, I found--particularly in the initial tastes-- the drink to be too sweet. You may well enjoy it, though, since I prefer carbonated fruit drinks more on the citrus/sour end.<br /><br />The over-sweetness isn't accomplished with added sugar, or non-sugar additives; the sweetness comes from the apple and grape juice concentrates, which are the top two non-water ingredients.",3
"I have crackers every morning with my coffee. My husband has crackers every morning with his tea. We differ on our taste for crackers as well as on our taste for beverages. We both want a full grain cracker. But, my husband enjoys the Wasa Crispbread, Hearty crackers. Me...not so much. I far prefer the Finn Crisp variety. The four stars above reflect his review. In short, if you prefer a thick cracker, go for Wasa. If you like the crackers to be crispy and not so dry...go for Finn Crisp or something similar.",4
"Fantastic tuna- one I can feel safe about eating.  The flavor is unmatched by any other brand on the market and it is not full of water or oil, so your money is buying nice, chunk tuna- not liquid and small flakes of tasteless fish.  Sustainable harvest practices and tested for mercury!!! I highly recommend!!",5
I took a chance seeing the variation experienced by others.  The shipment that we received has such a minimal taste of cinnamon that I wouldn't say they're cinnamon if given a sample.  We opened each of the packs to see if any were a strong cinnamon taste but no luck.  I definitely won't reorder these.,1
"though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed.  i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results.  the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes.  still nothing.<br /><br />i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck.  i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.<br /><br />as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did",1
"This is just a superior toy and paste for a crazy, chewing puppy.....I have a new MaltePom and this is a revered toy.  I give it to him in his crate whenever I need to leave or it is sleep time.  He loves it.",5
"Sure, they tasted great at first, and I was happy to order my kids a healthy meat snack without all those artifical cancer causing ingredients.  Problem is, that after a short period of time (way before the expiration date), half the packages molded disgustingly inside.  We have a completely air conditioned house, they were stored in a cool pantry that is mostly kept dark.  Reading the other reviews, I know I am not the only one with this problem.  Something is wrong with the packaging process, or the cooking process, but these rot fast UNOPENED.  Don't bother with this, find another product and don't waste your money =/",1

"I ordered this product on May 3, 2010 and figured that like all products I order it would be here within a week.  Yesterday I received an email telling me that the product will not be shipped until May 17 and will not be at my door until May 24.  And yet it's taken them over a week to even inform me of this.  Bad business practice if you ask me.<br /><br />First, I LOVE this tea.  Best green tea you can buy.  I have nothing but rave reviews about the tea.  Sadly, due to the name and people thinking it's a 'Mexican' brand of tea it was not a big seller in area stores and everyone stopped carrying it.  I have had to find a place online to order.  Well, I can say that the next time I have to order I will be finding someone else to get it through.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed in the shipping. :(",2
"Camano Island Shade grown and organic coffee not only produces a wonderful and flavorful cup of java but saves trees from being chopped down as well. The Sumatra coffee is a real eye-opener, a coffee lovers coffee with a very bold rich taste(dark roast). The aroma alone will get you going in the morning and will be a great afternoon pick-me-up as well. It's as good if not better the the more expensive designer labels, and this 5lb bag is a truly good buy. Shade Grown/Organic is pretty expensive at my local market.<br /><br />But what's up with the packaging. It arrived in a heavy-weight clear plastic bag. Not very environmentally friendly. Also, it is very hard to keep sealed. It has one of those cheap sticky tabs you pull over to reseal and at that it is not very sticky.By the second use it wasn't working. I transferred my coffee into the largest Tupperware bowl I could find(5 lbs. is a lot of coffee) to keep it fresh.<br /><br />5 stars for the coffee. I love it and would buy it again, but Camano Islands - if you are listening- please improve the packaging.<br /><br />Thanks and enjoy....Laurie<br /><br />also available in a medium roast - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V9SN4A"">Camano Island Coffee Roasters Sumatra, Medium Roast, Ground, 80-Ounce Bag</a>",4
"This is not the best Fresh Mixer, but it is still very edible.  The sauce is bland and the pasta has a slightly metallic taste.  If you are eating a lot of Fresh Mixers I suppose this one is okay for the variety it offers, but its really just very average.  I will try others before ordering it again.  Still has good nutrition though for microwave food.",3
"I am convinced that fair trade, organic food is best for us, the planet and our neighbors. So when I saw this option for coffee I was eager to give it a go as good organic coffee is rare. This is a good, but not great, option.<br /><br />I found that most of the time I would get either too weak or too strong coffee. If I went with one package it was too weak. Two packages was too much. I couldn't find the sweet spot. With the packets being pre-packaged you would think the amount would be just right.<br /><br />Incidentally, the packets are hard to open. I don't know if I got a pack of glitched packets but mine did not have notches in them. This didn't affect my score.<br /><br />Overall, if you can get the right mix it is still organic, free trade coffee and I'll take it any day over the stuff from the big manufacturers. But I was hoping for an easier just-strong-enough experience.",3
"Just picked up some this weekend to experiment with, and so far I've found that it makes REALLY yummy coconut oil chocolates. I don't know why others think it doesn't taste chocolatey. Definitely tastes like chocolate to me, and I've started getting really picky-- but then again, everyone I know has different preferences with their chocolate tastes.",4
"My dogs have not been too hard to please with food.  They will eat almost anything, but they have little interest in the 3 cases of this stuff I bought.  Maybe I should add something to it like salt?",2
"I have tried several energy boost supplement drinks and thought this one might be good.  I sampled the Acai Pomegranate flavor, and it did not taste like acai berry or pomegranate.  The flavor was intensely sweet and the mixture a bit slimy--even with additional liquid.  I didn't like the texture of the drink at all.  As for ingredients, it seemed to have all the vitamins associated with energy boost, though it also contained caffeine.  That's a big turn off for me.  If it had tasted badly but still gave solid results, I would just choose another flavor.  I'm not interested in a caffeinated product.  I also found the packaging difficult to open and resorted to scissors.  Not very efficient for those on-the-go.  It may be a great flavor for some, and the caffeine may not be a bother.  I won't invest further in this product.",2
"I am addicted to caramel apple cider - and being only 10 calories and fairly inexpensive, I wanted so much to like this product. I thought even if it wasn't the best cider I'd ever had, it would at least be a good enough substitute for when I was watching my weight and couldn't afford to go to Starbucks. I was so wrong - what a waste of money! First off, it smelled so bad that it made me nauseous. I brought it to class with me, and was worried the whole time that everyone around me could smell it. Then, the taste was unbearable. I took a sip, gagged, tried adding some fat-free whipped cream, sugar-free caramel syrup, and cinnamon - still disgusting, the awful cider taste overpowered anything I put in. Needless to say, I wasted $10, will be throwing out all the k-cups, and will have to look for my cider fix elsewhere. Take the bad reviews seriously - I wish I had!",1
"The first time I drank this tea I almost gagged. I'd prepared it according to the directions but it was too spicy. I then had the good sense to add more water and a chamomile tea sachet to break down the spicyness...and it was wonderful. I then discovered that eating the ginger crystals by themselves was quite pleasant as well. I know it sounds weird, but the crystals are tasty, probably because they're so sweet...which leads me to my next point. Although sugar TASTES good, im not a fan of consuming too much of it. It's 17 grams per packet, which I think is too high for a cup of tea. It makes my teeth feel all gritty afterwards (no bueno). If they made a sugar free version I'd be sold :)",3

It may be that I am reacting to the omnipresence of that bitter, over-roasted stuff Starbucks pours. Well, this Marley blend is bitter as well, but intrinsically so, with a tongue-slapping sting. I don't feel that it is a product of over-roasting, but rather, the nature of the bean. I like it. It makes me want to sip it while alternating chocolate mousse and cabernet. Seriously. Try that combination for dessert sometime. It is the great triumvirate.<br /><br /> I am particular about my coffee and yet compromise my taste by going the K-cup route. doing the 200 degree water drip through the unbleached paper with freshly ground beans thing is not for me on an very early weekday morning. I can barely put my pants on, let alone manipulate a container full of near-boiling water. That level of love is left for the weekend, when I have the time to take the time to linger lovingly over proper preparation as if it were the Tea Ceremony.<br /><br />That being said, there is no need to compound the sin of employing a pod or K-cup while using that stuff that sits on the grocer's shelf for months. Use good coffee. Marley's is packed in foil and tasted fairly fresh.",4
"My dogs love them. They smell pretty intensely which is always good. They have three calories per treat. About pea-sized.<br /><br />I used them for training and when they go to their areas when I head out to work in the morning.<br /><br />There's really not much more to be said. I did set up the amazon subscription on a two-month basis and may bump that up to monthly eventually. I will see.<br /><br />I can only recommend these because the price and value are excellent and they are great if you have does. Light, small, portable.",5
"This is a high quality soup but for me it would be great without the Green Chiles.  If you prefer mild salsa over hot salsa, this soup may not be for you.",3
"My cat loved the dry version of spot's stew.  When she was sick with a UTI, I purchased this in hopes of adding some additional fluid to her diet.  When I dumped it in her bowel, she looked up at me as if I were mad, and I couldn't blame her.  It is literally ""stew,"" with whole chunks of peas, carrots, etc. in it.  Cats are carnivores.  I have owned several, and I have never seen one of them willingly eat a piece of fruit or vegetable, grain products excluded, that hadn't been completely ground up and disguised in something else.<br /><br />She took one sniff and walked away.  Of course, cats are unpredictable creatures and YMMV.  But there are loads of good quality pate-style wet foods and all-meat wet foods that most cats are more likely to prefer.",2
"This is my favorite k-cup coffee- no complaints there. Amazon shipped them loose in a box- no padding to keep them from jostling in transit. One foil seal was punctured, several were loosened at the edges. Every cup was covered with coffee grounds residue. In the past, they came with some filler in the box to keep them from moving around during shipping. These were just thrown in- cheap and lazy shipping- errrhhh.",2
"I ordered Timothy's just to try it out, and then I went back to the product we used previously at our office. Well, employees started approching me to tell me how good Tomothy's coffee is, and we've swithed to Timothy's ever since (over a year ago).",5
Love the product and the delivery service from Amazon!!!!! Torani caramel sauce is great for my homemade coffee drinks and saves me money from buying the coffee stand drinks.,5
"The first thing that hit me is that these appear to be a low-acid gype of coffee....I didn't get that icky feeling some coffees give you after you drink them.  That is a definite plus.  But the coffee itself isn't that strong either.  I'm not into Kona or really deep flavors, I like just a medium blend.  But this still seemed weak.  It almost came across as coffee-tea than a strong cup of joe.<br /><br />I don't think I'd order this particular blend again.",3
"The Caribou Coffee is of course equal and the same as any I could buy in a store or at any other on-line vendor.  The time it took to get to me was unacceptable though.  I will not be ordering my coffee from this vendor again.  I opted to pay for speedier shipping although I was eligible for the free Super Saver on this item, because I knew I would soon be running out of coffee at home.  I then received a notice of a shipping date that was almost 2 weeks from order date!  I had to then take my time and get stressed arguing with them about the fact that I'd paid extra for expidited shipping. I did get my shipping fees refunded, but not my coffee sooner.  So I had to then go out to a store to purchase coffee to use until the order from Amazon finally arrived, which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place by placing the order on line.  Not a happy camper on this one!",1

"The probiotics helps my baby's gassiness. However, my 8 month old likes her food thick. No matter how much rice cereal I added, the food practically digests itself (very quickly at that too) before my baby even has a couple spoons of it. Don't understand why it has to contain amylase enzyme. I have let it stand and literally watch it thins itself out, without my baby ever touching the food. I typically added a couple ounces of homemade organic vege with an ounce of breastmilk plus the Earth Best oat and rice together with Happy Bellies, hoping to keep it thick a little longer, but to no avail. I am writing this review because I just threw out another bowl of food because my baby refuses to eat it after a couple spoons since it literally just became soup despite I made it *thick*.",3
"This green tea is delicious. My new diet calls for green tea or coffee only. I am not a coffee drinker and usually drink ice tea. This green tea is perfect hot or cold! I use Stevia and it taste perfect. With the cooler months upon us, this will make a great hot drink to sip on...not to mention the benefits of green tea! Buy it...you won't be disappointed!",5
I am not crazy about this tea.  It tastes really blend.  I even tried brewing with two tea bags. It is definitely a thumb down in comparison to other chai tea.,3
"It does not taste like chipotle.  I do like spicy foods, but the hot spicy flavor was a bit one-dimentional, in other words, there was no depth to the taste.  I could replicate the same flavor by just adding a bunch of crushed chili peppers into a plain can of tuna.",2
I liked it but I think it is very similar to Outrageous Ginger Ale except Outrageous Ginger Ale is better. This product was crisp etc. I am sorry I could not give better reviews. My favorite ginger ale is Healthy Valley's ginger ale.,3
This hot sauce did not live up to it's hype.It has a real good flavor but was not hot by any means.,2
I enjoyed this coffee. It was smooth and rich. A bit chalky if brewed too strong. 3.5,3

"I decided to try a different smoked salt (I've been using Williams and Sonoma hickory smoked salt) and was extremely disappointed in this.<br /><br />Although the salt has a strong smell of smoke to it, you have to use so much on food to even notice the smoke that the food becomes inedible.<br /><br />I ordered this because the description clearly states ""full smoky flavor.""  There is not much flavor of smoke at all to this salt.",2
"I bought this as a Christmas present, thinking it would be a cool way to grow tomatos and jalapenos inside (I got the Salsa Garden kit).<br /><br />One of the tomato plants didn't germinate.  Aerogarden was quick to send a replacement, but it was too late to plant it.  I ended up transplanting of the seedlings from the side that germinated to the other side.<br /><br />Within a couple weeks, the pump started rattling.  I called in multiple times and never got to a live person.  Emails went unanswered.<br /><br />Finally a couple weeks ago (it's the last week in March), the pump started to make so much noise I thought the dishwasher was on!  We finally got ahold of someone at Aerogarden (we left a message and they called us back a couple days later).  They said they'd send a new pump.  They also recommended that we switch from tap water to some sort of bottled water.<br /><br />The change to RO water did not help the plants, if anything they really didn't like it.<br /><br />Today the pump finally died.  I've transplanted the plants to dirt, where they'll likely die.  We called AG again, and they said that a pump had been sent and that they would send us another salsa garden kit.<br /><br />To make matters worse, when I tried to pull the pump out following the directions in the manual (I was cleaning out the basin so it wouldn't stink), the pump cover broke!<br /><br />Ugh!<br /><br />Now I'm using the grow light to help sprout some new seeds to plant outside in my garden.  At $150, it is a heck of an expensive grow lamp!<br /><br />Harvest?  Well, there are about 2 dozen green tomatos and a few ripening ones.  We've only got one pepper that's growing.  Color me disappointed!",2
"I bought these because the Altoid Ginger mints are no longer availabe in stores and you need to spend $20.00 or so and get boxes of them at Amazon.  Unfortunately, these ginger candies did not do the trick for my nausea.  They don't even taste gingery.  They do have a pleasant enough taste though.",3
Compare the ingredients.. This stuff is no better for you than the original Skippy. They both have the same ingredients (check for yourself) except the one thing they changed was replacing that nasty partially hydrogenated oil with palm oil which is no better for you and will still clog your arteries. If you're truly looking for a natural peanut butter look for one without any oils added to it period. I myself really like Smuckers Natural Peanut Butter with Honey. It tastes great. Stirring it can be a pain but it is so worth it if it's better for our health.,1
"My dog is a 62lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix that repeatedly suffers from allergies, especially food allergies. He can also be a bit of a picky eater when it comes to his food so finding the right mix can often be difficult. While he loves just about any treat, I always have reservations about trying new food. Unfortunately, a large majority of popular dog foods today are filled with terrible ingredients not to mention carrying a high price tag. I'm always willing to try a new food so here are my thoughts on PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ Dog liked it and gobbled it up.<br /><br />+ Resealable Ziploc style bag.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Filled with tons of poor ingredients for your dog such as Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat, soy flour, sugar, propylene glycol, meat and bone meal, animal digest, added color (Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 2), garlic oil, menadione sodium bisulfite complex. Artificial colors? Seriously? Do you really think the dog cares what color the food is when they eat it? Who are we trying to appeal to here, the dog or the person?<br /><br />- $22 is a bit expensive for a 15.5lb bag.  This food is often much cheaper at big box retailers and grocery stores.<br /><br />- Bag is plastic and currently not recyclable.<br /><br />My dog really enjoyed PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food.  However don't we all enjoy food that's bad for us? Unfortunately, that's exactly what this dog food is, bad for your dog. Someone said in a previous review if my dog was reviewing this food it would get 5 stars and my dog would agree with that. Lucky for him I know what's good for his health and PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food isn't it. With so many questionable and downright poor ingredients it's hard to really recommend this food for your dog. I definitely wouldn't purchase it again. Our current food is Nature's Domain Turkey Meal and Sweet Potato which is sold at Cost Co. It contains no potentially harmful ingredients, settles very well with my dog and is only $30 for a 25lb bag. If you're looking for a good healthy food, I recommend Nature's Domain brand or if you want to better educate yourself on what's actually in your current dog food I suggest visiting dogfoodadvisor.com. It's a great site that lists nearly all dog foods, breaks every ingredient and its properties down and gives a final overall rating on the food's quality.",2
"Following Tazo's lead, Higgins & Burke has decided to market as ""green tea"" a tea where the dominant flavors are lemon and lemongrass. It's not bad, but it's green tea for people who don't like green tea.<br /><br />Bag for bag, this tea costs nearly twice as much as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GG0BNE"">Bigelow's Green Tea</a>, which in my mind sets the bar for bagged green tea: a high-quality product that's almost ridiculously cheap. (Bigelow also offers a ""Green Tea with Lemon"" variety, which I haven't tried.) In short, I can't recommend Higgins & Burke's unexceptional offering.",3

After using them almost daily for about a month when my twin girls were born (exhausting work by the way!)...I noticed even though I wasn't eating much I still wasn't losing weight.

"Oh, dear God it tastes like mothballs. I really wanted to like this product and commit to it -- so I ordered a case of the creamy chocolate fudge shakes. I previously was on the Robard products, but didn't like having to go to the doctor every week so I could get the shakes (it's doctor-supervised). Robard shakes are delicious and filling, but have a lot of unhealthy ingredients and are expensive, plus not readily accessible. When I found Orgain, I thought it'd be a great alternative because it's organic. However, if you're lactose-intolerant, beware -- it contains milk. And a very strange mediciney taste. I'm stuck with a case of this stuff -- maybe if I blend it with bananas it'll be palatable. Buy a couple of the single servings, if you can find them, before committing to a large order.",2

"****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers. It is rather weak, but a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle. I think that Stash's more natural teas seem to be a little weak and undistinguished, while their flavored teas are super-powerful, erring on the side of too powerful for me, overwhelming the tea drinker with all types of strong added flavorings. If I had to pick, I'd always take subtle, as you can make these teas, like this chamomile tea, stronger by doubling up on the bags, but you can't make the strongly flavored teas weaker or less annoying.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and they are moving in the direction of more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of added flavorings. I appreciate that their chamomile is so pure, but wish it could be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />Still, recommended.<br />****",4
"Quick Look:<br />Pros: 1) Packaged well 2) Light sweet flavor<br />cons: 1) plastic bottle is very light material 2) Looks filtered 3) Quantity advertised is misleading<br /><br />We received the Ambrosia Pure Honey today. It came in a package with several items ordered and all four 10 oz bottles came wrapped together in a sealed plastic bag with bubble wrap inside the bag protecting the containers. The containers are very light duty. So much so that I thought I would break the container just twisting the cover off to get the foil protection removed. The honey came in the same large box from Amazon with metal tools I ordered so it might have been nice if the bag of honey bottles had been dropped into a separate small box as well.<br /><br />We immediately opened a bottle for a taste test.  It has a very, very light honey flavor and color to it that is pleasant and very sweet. Though it says it is unfiltered it does look like it has been filtered to some degree. It is a little lighter than the picture displayed as well.<br /><br />Most of the honey producers we deal with list their honey in fluid ounces or in pounds.  I was unfamiliar with this supplier but was intrigued by the area it comes from so, I bit without asking about the true weight.  The conversion to weight makes a big difference in pricing.  This advertiser states 16-Ounce Bottles. Well, each bottle is about 10 fluid ounces not 16 ounces as you might be led to believe.  So if you thought it was 16 fluid ounces of honey and you just got 4 lbs of honey you just paid a premium for your honey because 4 bottles or 64 fluid ounces of honey should be 6 lbs. The advertisement should state 4 lbs. of honey. ""16-Ounce Bottles"" is misleading and maybe done so on purpose. If it doesn't say pint, quart or, pounds I guess the question needs to be asked up front about what we are buying. It makes one appreciate the Dutch Gold Company with their ""Bulk Orange Blossom Honey - 5 lb.""  No mistake here and they have great packaging.<br /><br />Bottom Line :(  I paid $4.39/lb verses $2.92/lb as I expected for this product due to the weight difference. Generally I try to keep the price to $3/lb and have received a good value from ""honeydabber"" on Ebay though the product comes in thermally sealed bags for that price. Dutch Gold Company through Amazon is straight forward about their weight as well but the product is pasteurized and filtered.  In the end Ambrosia was only an average product and gets only an average review.",3

"Since Senseo pods are impossible to find, I thought I would give these a try.  Using one pod was like drinking hot water with a coffe colored tint.

"I bought both the bristle bone and this one, the bouncey bone. When I bought them I thought the high price was easy to justify.  A toy that satisfies a chewing urge, smells yummy, and keeps my dog entertained sounded like a great thing.  The pieces unscrew so you can reload the rawhide rings.  My medium sized dog found it very easy to take it apart, and I found the pieces scattered while he chewed on it under my desk.  It happened so quickly that when I discovered it, he had already started to destroy one of the purple rubber rings on the bristle bone. I wanted to prevent the disassembly trick, so I screwed the pieces together more tightly.  Unfortunately the weak nylon piece broke off when I did that.  There's about $20 down the drain.  Maybe I should have stuck to Nylabones.",3
The packaging is rather painful to open.  They should design these with parents of new babies in mind.  Most food products with peel tops have one corner which is indicated as the side to open and the hard plastic has a crack allowing for the user to easily bend and peel the top.  No such luck with these tubs of baby food from Gerber.  It's not clear which side should be opened by the packaging and whichever one you choose will be equally stubborn before you can finally peel the top and feed your hungry baby.,3

"Pacific Natural is a great brand and Light Sodium Organic Creamy Tomato Soup is a winning product. It is a rich, flavorful, smooth soup. A bowl of this is a tasty and convenient way to have one of the five daily recommended servings of fruits and vegetables.<br /><br />I take off one star because I have recently begun counting my sodium intake and this soup often puts my daily total over. I'm just trying to not exceed the normal, recommended amounts of sodium, nothing drastic. I wish Pacific Natural Foods would sell a version of their soups with no added salt, at all. We could carefully add our own salt, or not. Actually, it would be perfect if they made a ""super light sodium"" version with 50% less salt than this, the ""50% less salt"" version. I could have it every day.<br /><br />This has 380 mg per 1 cup serving. This is a lower amount than the regular Organic Creamy Tomato by Pacific Natural Food, which has a whopping 750 mg per cup. For those who aren't watching their sodium, both of these soups will be good. But, I bought the ""Low Sodium"" version because of an interest in keeping daily sodium intake within recommended healthy levels. Comparing it to frozen ""healthy"" entrees, this has more sodium than some ""main dishes"". As a side dish, this has a significant amount of added salt.<br /><br />For watching calories and nutrients (like sodium) there's a great, free website at ""everydayhealth.com"". Users can list every thing eaten and it calculates the fat, protein, sugar carbohydrates and sodium for each day. I find this a tremendously helpful resource. It has an expanded nutritional content view that allows easy scanning and comparison of foods. Things with with higher salt, fat or sugar are easy to spot. This soup comes up on the higher-sodium side of things I eat.<br /><br /> It has been a revelation how much salt is in most prepared foods. Even ""healthy"" brands like Weight Watchers, Eating Right, Lean Cuisine, Amy's, O Organics, Morningstar Farms, etc. have enough sodium to make hitting targets difficult. For salt-watching fans of this soup, you may not be doing as well as you thought. I'll still buy this, but will eat it less often/in smaller portions. Looks like cooking from scratch is best to insure not overdoing the salt. Too bad, easy to prepare, healthy meals are a great convenience and there is a place for them in this busy world. Enjoy the soup, but count the milligrams!",4

"Even at $6 per canister, this product is inexplicably overpriced. Let me explain why:<br /><br />Intro to Oats 101--Oats, in whole form, are known as groats. In an effort to cut down on cooking time (or eating time, for those on the run, who don't have the time or patience to chew @mouthful 20-30x), oats are refined into the following:<br /><br />  -steel cut oats--cracked into two or more pieces<br />  -oat flakes--flattened with an oat roller<br />  -oatmeal--same as flakes, but parboiled<br />  -instant oatmeal--more processed than reg. oatmeal<br />  -oat flour--milled into dust, for baked goods or as a thickening<br />  agent.<br /><br />This product fits into the first catagory.  Their claim of ""guaranteed uniformity"" is a coined phrase, meaning each cracked grain is the same size, a gourmet characteristic.<br /><br />All this being said, I am not aware of oats from Scotland or Ireland having any magical or mystical quality, outside of marketing hype or myth.  Truth be told, you could go to any health food store with a bulk bin (one sign of a conscientious health food store), buy whole oats, certified organic, for about $2 per lb., and crack your own oats with a grain mill (Corona brand, one time investment, about $70, lifetime expectancy), or in a blender. For those more ambitious, you could cook them whole, which involves soaking them overnight, then simmering for about 90 minutes. Do not be put off by the cooking time, it is unattended, with a flame deflector. Cooking becomes a chore because of prep time, not the time on the stove.<br />Why whole? Because any time you grind or crack a grain, there is nutrient loss and, to those open to more estoteric models, a loss of life force (a.k.a. ""chi"").<br /><br />I did buy this product, and as connoisseur of oats, I was not impressed, did not give the same energy boost as others. Did not taste fresh, either.<br /><br />Now, onto an advanced concept: if you truly want the ""Rolls Royce"" of oats, there is a brand called ""Really Raw Oats"". Why is this? Because the oats commercially available are partially steamed to protect against rancidity (oats are about 10% fat, albeit an exceptionally healthful fat).  How do I know this? Because a truly raw grain will sprout. Attempts to sprout other oats have been fruitless.<br /><br />The Really Raw Oats carry a price tag of about $11 per lb., but are worth it. Conversely, the product here, in my opinion, does not command the price point it seeks.<br /><br />p.s.  the best TASTING oats I had came out of Canada--when you dry-roasted them in a pan, it took on the aroma of vanilla--BLISS! Haven't seen them, however, since the mid 1990's.

I bought it primarily for the name of the pudding which is reason enough for me.<br />We had lots of laughs getting our pictures taken with the box, then ate the dessert.  I have to say it tastes delicious but again I have nothing to compare it to.<br />I look forward to an unsuspecting relative to open a present this Christmas and find the ""Spotted Dick"" and go what the.

"Well, this blend is a bit more 'expressive' than a typical english breakfast tea. It has floral undertones, that I would say is an addition to the typical taste associated with black tea. It has a mildly acidic/astrigent flavor, but not to the point that the blend is sour.<br />The blend is sufficient for am 8 oz cup, and has no real drawbacks.<br />i would recommend the blend.<br />I noted another reviewer found the tea to be watery. This happened to me once when I selected the 15bar pump pressure by mistake on the CBTL machine. But, I must say that if you are use to loose tea leaves in a seeping basket, this pod-derived tea will seem a bit less than optimal.",4

"I am a fan of other brands of hibiscus soda and hibiscus vodka so I thought this Torani syrup would be perfect. It's not undrinkable but the taste is artificial.

This hibiscus syrup is better as a faint note than a dominant flavor.",3

It's not the first time she's refused a treat, so I didn't think it merited a star rating quite so bad as ""I hate it.""<br /><br />I won't be buying any, though, unless she has a radical change of heart very soon.",2
"I purchased this type of enzymatic chew to help control tartar build up on my dog's teeth.  I even verified that the additive Chlorhexdine is safe by contacting my Vet. I must say that my dog loved these chews  but they made her very ill for several days after just the first one.  She suffered from runny bowels and vomitting. The clean up alone was dreadful and so time consuming.  Of course, she's worth it, but I would never want to put her through this kind of debilitating experience again.",1
"The flavor of the cereal is pleasantly toasty.  It's a strong flavor but not overpowering.  They stay crunchy in milk for some time and the flavor of the left over milk at the bottom of the bowl, an important part of any breakfast, is nicely sweet.<br /><br />Two down sides.  For me, the cereal sat heavily in my stomach for the better part of the morning. A friend who used the same amount of cereal and milk didn't experience that, so it's probably different for everybody.<br /><br />Secondly, several times as I was eating, I found a clump of compressed peanut bits and dust.  It was a very unpleasant contrast of texture and flavor with the sweetened milk and the rest of the cereal.",2
"wish I would of tasted one before i bought this half & half.<br />just to sum it up, it tasted like chemicals. The southern Ice Tea on the other hand is very good.",1
"Read the ingredients.  These are good prospects for a treat that the dog loves and it appears that even at small amounts, make a difference on teeth. Seriously.  Most of all, large border collie, ten years old, loves them.  We keep amounts low, most evenings give her a half of one bone.  They leave no mess behind, to not choke like rawhide.  Originally purchased at costco, now bummed that they have to be ordered online.  They are worth it.",5
"This was a fine food until some time in early August, 2008. I bought two bags, this formula for my old, 140 lb dog, and lamb meal and rice for my 1 year old. They had loose stools the entire time. My older dog finished his bag, and I switched him to Innova, the diarrhea cleared up immediately, so the argument that Canidae makes on the web site about needing to make a slow transition is at best specious. I will have to throw out the remaining food for my young dog, to get him back to normal. Investigate the very large number of complaints on the web about the new formula before exposing your pet to it.",1
"Compared to Celestial Seasonings English Breakfast, this tea is weak.  The tea tastes like the second run of the other brand.  Purchased Twinings because much cheaper than C.S., but will not make that mistake again!",3
"If you want black tea, then buy this. If you are looking for black tea with passion fruit, DON'T buy this! There is no hint of passion fruit in this tea; can't smell it nor can you taste it. Therefor I don't recommend it.",1
"Great product I'm on AutoShip, the only thing that would make this better is if it was packaged in a glass container. Quality",4
"Having recently been diagnosed with diabetes, it's been difficult to find something to eat for breakfast that won't shoot my blood sugar through the roof.  My one & two hour post prandial glucose has been consistently below 140 after a pancake breakfast with this product. Half of a whole grain English muffin shoots it up over 180. My diet choices are complicated by that fact that, in addition to a diabetic diet, I'm also on a low salt, low fat low cholesterol diet (I'm sure I'm not alone, however).  I agree with prior reviewers that the pancakes are a little eggy but they taste really good nonetheless; light, fluffy and yummy.  I substituted Eggbeaters for the eggs (reducing further the calories, fat & cholesterol); they still taste great but maybe not as fluffy.  Next batch I'll try half eggs & half Eggbeaters.  Wonderful product!",5
I used this a month or so ago and it worked great.  I was afraid to get it on the leaves on my plants so I was very careful and in doing so I have noticed that the only weeds I have had since I applied it are right next to the root of my plants.  So I know it works because before that I had weeds like crazy in between all my flowers and plants.  This stuff was worth every penny!,5
"You know I wrote to Lesser Evil before I had purchased the individual size bags. I was buying the large bags at the grocery store and it was great. The small bags had so many hard kernels that I actually broke a tooth. I had split the box with a friend and she too said that she about busted a tooth also. I don't know the reasoning but maybe the way it is manufactured. I absolutely love this popcorn, but I know that I will never buy the small bags again. I was sad because this is my absolute favorite snack.",1
"I bought this product because of the 5 star reviews for it.  I did see a one star review that said it was overly spicy, but since I like spicy things I thought I'd try them.  It is a decent ginger product, but is less than restaurant quality (unless you go to a restaurant that serves this bottle!).  It is more spicy than the other ginger I have tried at restaurants, but that did not bother me.  The issue I have with this product is that the after taste is not fresh.  When I first bit into the ginger I thought it was going to be great because initially it tastes just like I remember restaurant quality ginger.  The aftertaste is the disappointment.",3
"This Barista Prima Italian roast is suppose to be full bodied with a sweet edge.  It is not.  It is Medium-Bold (not extra bold), and has a bitter taste and a distinct aftertaste.  Milk & sugar help, but the bitter and aftertaste are still there.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL512"">Tully's Coffee Italian Roast, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> is a much better choice if you want a good Italian blend.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this kcup in a free sample pack mailed by Keurig to its customers.",2
"I ordered way too many boxes of this tea. I ordered several boxes before trying this tea, I had to give some of them away. It is not as good as I thought it was.  The key is to put more milk and a sweetener in it to improve the taste.  It taste okay, but not good enough for me to order this product a second time.",3
"I think this product might work well in some situations.  For me, my dog was very small when I got it, and right after receiving it, he needed to be trained without treats.  Then, when he was 9 months old, about 4 months after receiving the product, I decided to try it again, as he was at that age where he knows he should come when called, but is a bit defiant about it.  By then, the stuff in the bottle had gotten a bit thick, and the roller didn't work too well.  I used it a little anyway, just forcing the ball to roll with my finger, but I then left it in my coat pocket, and when I wasn't paying attention, Archie bit into the pocket and crushed the bottle and it oozed out inside my pocket - arghh!  Not the product's fault, obviously.  It could definitely work, but I think I will just stick with the old standard kibbles in a plastic bag for now anyway.",3
"My son is 8 but due to his disability is on a very low calorie diet and has issues chewing many low calorie foods such as raw veggies.  These packets are a fun way for him to enjoy a low calorie snack when we are on the go (only 35-40 calories for many of the packets).  He loves the taste and of course there is no worry about choking hazards.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because they are extremely pricey, even at the lowest price I could find it really adds up.",4
"Bilberry....it sounded so...so....tasty.  I am sure that this tea is good for your health and for that reason I give it the 3 stars. Unfortunately, it smells and tastes like fish which is something I just cannot tolerate.  I tried it several times and just could not drink it.  I have a close friend who is Asian and she likes it, but she eats a lot of fish sauce so I guess her tastebuds are adapted to that taste.  Not mine.  I would also say that I am not a finicky eater (I do eat fish), and I do tolorate a lot of tastes for the sake of eating healthy, including eating things on the bitter side - but 'fishy' is hard for me to swallow!  So, for now, I will have to try something else.  Anyone know what hawthorn berry tea taste like?",3
"This is probably the worst coffee I have ever had.  Product was weeks from expiring when I received it.  I love coffes, but would never buy this kind again!",1
"Used to buy this product all the time at former home, but unable to find in new state.  Now I know I can keep my supply up from this vendor.  Very pleased!",5
"I give this 1 star not because the product itself is bad, it is because of Amazon. The expiration date should be made clear on this site. I ordered 10 packs of these, just to find out they are gonna expire in about 1 month, which means I have to make 1 hot pot every 3 days... Oh god, as much as I love hot pot, I don't think my stomach is gonna like it.",1
"Well, it attracts moths well, as indicated by the ""powder"" marks on the tape.  On the other hand, it has yet to trap even one of them.  I think I can hear them laughing at me right now.",2
"AMAZING replacement for soda / soft drinks.  Celsius has no high fructose corn syrup, no aspartame, no nutrasweet, no carbs, no calories, but it still manages to taste really, really good.  Now, instead of my usual afternoon can of soda, I enjoy a can of Celsius...guilt-free!!!",5
"This is OK rice.  It cooks fairly well in my cooker, not as good as some other tho.  But the taste is really very earthy.  I don't mind that too much, but this is almost too strong tasting.",3
"The product arrived within the designated time but the cool packs surrounding the cheese were no longer cool. Inside was a leaflet stating that if this happens then it's no problem essentially and the cheese is still good which may be the case but I would have felt more assured by this product had it arrived cold. I had no idea how long the cheese was left out (non-cold). Other food distributors can manage to deliver their products still cold, why not igourmet?<br />I was particularly annoyed by this as the shipping for this item was so high.<br />I will not order anything that's fresh from igourmet again simply for this reason.",2
"I was very excited when I read reviews about the product. I read about the product with an expiration code of March 2013 will be BPA free.I waited for a while to order this product for that reason.<br /><br />All cans I received were ""Expired January 2013"", and yes, it is BPA liner in.<br /><br />Maybe the Amazon warehouse had a lot of stock of the products, but I could not believe the canned food I received has expire date within 6 months.",1
This is the microwave version of the original. I cannot stand it. The noodles have no flavor at all; and to me it is not spicy. I will not order any more of this product!,1
"While tasting of hickory, the flavor was abit overdone. And some portions (oddly since this is dried) tasted rather greasy.",3
"I have used this conditioner a couple of times and I find it be pretty average. It does have some of the botanical ingredients that I use such as sunflower and coconut oil but those are only a small fraction of a conditioner that basically has the standard commercial conditioner ingredients. I say this so that you won't be drawn in simply because of these ""special"" ingredients.<br /><br />With that said, I condition-wash my hair because it is thick and curly. I don't have any chemicals or dyes on my hair either. My preference is to saturate my hair with conditioner in order to detangle it. Unfortunately, this conditioner did not work as well for this task as some other cheaper commercial conditioners. I have used the V05 Moisture Milks line with great success although it is thinner than CLEAR. CLEAR required me to use nearly half of the bottle the first time because I have so much hair and it just wasn't allowing me to detangle the way I need to.<br /><br />CLEAR has a medium thickness and it's pink. I haven't noticed a fragrance that's worth remarking about. The top (where the product dispenses from) is actually the bottom of the container which is a positive since conditioner gets harder to access as the bottle becomes emptier and emptier.<br /><br />In terms of the length, well, that takes more time than one bottle of conditioner will allow. Most hair grows at a steady rate of about 1/2 inch a month regardless of what shampoo and conditioner you use. Diet is also a factor in hair growth so I wouldn't get hung up on the ""Strong Lengths"" part of the title.<br /><br />Overall, I feel that there are other conditioners that cost less and can do more (if not just as much). I did not experience any negative effects from using this product but I didn't see any positive effects either. However, hair health, just like any number of things requires effort and nurturing for positive results over the long term.",3
I ordered the Wafu Ginger Carrot dressing (set of 4) and none of the bottles were sealed. I ended up throwing them all away. I do not recommend ordering from this company.,1
"Good seasonal and anytime coffee. In my opinion, the best of all the seasonals I've tried. Try it, if available, it's good. Remember, if you don't like it, as we all have different palettes, it can be returned.",4
"Buffalo Bills Premium Snacks<br /><br />I realize that taste is an individual thing, but I thought I'd share my thoughts on these products.<br /><br />First, customer service is excellent.  I've always gotten exactly what I ordered in a very timely manner.<br /><br />So far I've ordered the following products:<br /><br />1) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Mild Short Shots<br /><br />2) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Hot Short Shots<br /><br />The first two short shots are very similar to Slim Jim's, just not individually wrapped, I just put them in a zip lock bag and find them very convenient to munch on( about a quarter pound per bag.<br /><br />3) Buffalo Bills 1.2lb Extra Smokeys<br />These are very smokey, but a little too dry for my taste.<br /><br />4) Buffalo Bills 16oz Premium Hickory Beef Jerky Pieces (random size)<br /><br />Taste great if you are a jerky lover.<br /><br />5) Buffalo Bills 2.1lb Pepperoni  Short Shots<br />Probably the closest to Slim Jim's of all the short shots<br /><br />6) Big Buffalo Ole Smokies<br />Fatter, crisp not as crunchy as short shots, individually wrapped.<br /><br />7) Buffalo Bills 2.1lbs Honey Strung<br />O.K. taste.  My wife hates the smell.  My Brother doesn't care much for them either.<br /><br />All- in- all, I highly recommend these products (in the order listed) and this company.<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2010",5
These cookies are very tasty.  They are especially good with sherbert or ice cream.  They have a nice buttery taste.  Yumm.,4
"Should of read some other reviews first.  I've experienced  > 50% failure rate - not much worse feeling in your mouth than a bunch of grounds.  tried 5 or 6 pods, only had 2 that didn't fail.  Anyone want to buy some leaky pods, cheap ?  Very disappointing, terrible quality control.<br /><br />Quality / taste of coffee itself was OK, if filters in pods had not failed this would of been a 3-star review.",1
"Allow me to give you some frame of reference on me:  I'm not a vegan or even vegetarian, or sufferer of Celiac Disease.  If I fell into either one of those camps, I would instantly raise the rating at least a star.  But since I'm not adverse to occasionally ingesting an artificial ingredient or two, I'll give you the straight dope on this very healthy snack bar.<br /><br />The ingredient list is quite impressive, if only for the fact that someone who doesn't have a chemistry degree can understand it.  That in itself is refreshing.  They've even got a YES/NO breakdown printed next to the ingredients that goes something like this:<br /><br />YES!:  Certified Organic, Gluten-Free, Full Serving [of] Fruit, Organic Protein, Rich in Omega-3s, Good Source of Fiber, Raw, Vegan<br /><br />NO!:  Refined Sugars, Gluten Dairy or Soy, Cholesterol, Trans Fats, Preservatives, GMOs, Artificial Nothin'<br /><br />WOW!  5-STARS SO FAR!  Let's tear this thing open!<br /><br />At first glance, it looks just like holiday fruitcake that's been mashed with a rolling pin.  Mmmmm...  Maybe that's why it doesn't need preservatives and the expiration date is almost a full year in the future.  Smells a lot like fruitcake, too.  I lost my first test subject (my wife) on looks and smell alone.  (Minus 1 star for lack of family appeal -- I don't count the kids' outright rejection.)<br /><br />The first bite redeemed the bar.  It's tastier than I'd anticipated, full flavored and sweet without being powdery or sugary.  I think I might like this.<br /><br />The second bite lost the other star instantly.  I felt like I almost broke a tooth on a rather large fruit pit.  Guess I should have paid closer attention to the disclaimer on the wrapper that states, ""May contain pieces of nuts, shells, stems, or pits.""  I found a stem in the other half of the bar.<br /><br />As good as this fruit bar may be for me, I don't think I should have to strain it prior to eating it.  I have enjoyed similarly nutritious bars in the past and not one thought of seeking a dentist.<br /><br />Though the PURE BAR is EVERYTHING they promise (pits and all), I'll probably do some more ""research"" (read: taste tests) on other healthy snack bars before buying a case.  I will, however, recommend this bar to a family member who needs a Gluten-free diet, because it tastes significantly better than most Gluten-free snacks I've sampled.<br /><br />Just be careful and take small bites.",3
"You know, I was searching the Internet for the words ""temptations"" and ""vomit"" when I came across these reviews.  I was surprised to hear that I'm not the only one who has had problems with this product.  Within an hour of eating these treats my cat vomits for about 40 minutes.  I didn't realize it was the cause until the second time I fed them to her.  It's really bad because it doesn't cause the cat to throw up all at once.  It's like she can just vomit a little at a time and you're forced to follow her around cleaning up all the vomit ((or locking her in the bathroom (which is horrible)).",1
"Have been trying to track this stuff down ever since I purchased a few bottles in the ""Gourmet"" (usually nearly outdated overpriced old stuff) food section at Marshalls... I bought 2 bottles. After seeing it and tasting it at home, I searched in every store!  My brain finally turned on and I started searching the internet... but by then it was sold out (usually by July)......Alma Gourmet out of NYC is the best place to buy it and they only charge 9.00 flat rate shipping!........The olive oil is pieridot green, unfiltered and is just the most amazing stuff you will ever try.....buttery smooth with no sharp overbearing bite...some people say olive oil will have either a peppery side or a grassy side......this has neither...it is just very hard to explain...if you call Alma today you  can get the harvest from October 2010 but ya better hurry!!!!!!....If you buy more than one bottle put it in the fridge it will keep till next year.",5
"I still love Nutella, but at 21g of sugar a serving I was looking for something a bit more guiltless. I saw the small packs at Target and decided to give it a try. I'm always a little skeptical, and have tried other chocolate spreads but once I tasted this one I knew I had found it. I do miss the creamy texture of Nutella, but the flavor is spot on, although more nutty/hazelnut than Nutella. This is a compromise for my health where I don't feel like I'm missing out. I don't even mind that it has less sugar - it's still plenty sweet to satisfy me. I'll probably still buy Nutella from time to time, but I think Justin's will be my staple!",4
"I've been adding Tulsi Tea to my diet.  I love the peppermint flavor and drink it daily along with my other great teas.<br /><br />I didn't really care for the flavor of this honey chamomile tea.  I don't think it was the honey flavor that was bothersome- actually the Tulsi just seemed at odds with the chamomile.  It actually tastes a bit like basil, which I hadn't experienced with the peppermint, I guess because the tastes meshed so well together.  In this cup, I actually felt like I was drinking Basil-Chamomile tea.<br /><br />I can say I've never tasted the anise flavor that people find prevalent in Tulsi teas.",2
"I can't give more than a 3 star average for this item, when considering the flavor and taste of this ""organic chocolate"" bar.<br /><br />Like some other Newman's Own food products that I've tasted, it doesn't offer any special quality, other than that the ingredients are virtually all ""organic"".  Unfortunately, our local, state and Federal requirements for ""organic"" foods, are severely flawed, and this product potentially  illustrates this problem quite well.<br /><br />The ingredients in these chocolate bars may meet most standards for organic foodstuffs, but there is an important element missing in the case of chocolate, that most people don't understand.<br /><br />I have read several articles recently about the high lead content of much of the chocolate that we consume, and for a period of time this problem was presumed to be that the cocoa beans themselves were (are) contaminated with lead, due to the leaded gasoline  in the engines of the farming equipment used in those countries that grow cocoa beans.<br /><br />However, some articles mention that lab analyses show that raw cocoa beans themselves have a relatively low amount of lead in them, compared to the final, processed chocolate products (and compared to other similar food products).  Some observant writers have then suggested that the high lead concentrations in cocoa products, are probably due to lead in the air near and over the drying beds, where the beans themselves are dried.  The reason for this contamination would be similar to the original theories, since there is likely high lead content in the air around these drying beds, for the prior reasoning (the lead in the gasoline used on the cocoa bean farms is emitted by tractor and other vehicle exhaust,  and then these contaminants attach themselves to the drying cocoa beans).<br /><br />At any rate, if the price of Newman's Own organic dark chocolate is as high as I suspect it is,  I would recommend buying a cheaper brand of chocolate bar (""organic"" or not), since there's no way to know whether Newman's Own chocolate has less (or more) lead in it, than other brands do.",3
"I probably would give one or two extra stars if it were not for my dog.<br /><br />With my friends dogs these treats last from 2 to 4 weeks.  With my dog who has jaws of steel, she can eat these up in under an hour.",3
This my husband's favorite flavor and it's easy to make! I don't bother with anything else.,5
"Around the four minute mark of ""Evilspeak"", I definitely realized this wasn't the tame television version I remember seeing as a teenager. This is the uncut, unrated and more graphic version with plenty of gore. Anchor Bay studios have remastered ""Evilspeak"" to it's original 1.77:1 aspect ratio with crisp and clean dolby 2.0 sound. The video transfer is really impressive and worth the money if you're a fan of this movie. After discovering a book of the occult, Stanley begins to translate the writings on his computer and he summons a powerful and evil force to help him get his revenge. Stanley's fellow classmates and teachers at the military academy have pushed him around for to long and now they'll pay the ultimate price.<br /><br />This movie does have some slow spots, but horror fans will appreciate the gore and carnage left behind as Stanley exacts his revenge on his tormentors in gruesome fashion. In my opinion, the ending in ""Carrie"" has nothing on this movie. This movie contains graphic violence, nudity and gore and in my opinion it isn't suitable for children. Evilspeak is a bare bones DVD release but does contain commentary with director Eric Weston and Clint Howard, plus the original theatrical trailer. Clint Howard may not be in the same league as his famous brother Ron Howard as an actor, but he's great when it comes to playing a creepy weirdo.<br /><br />DVD Features:<br />* Widescreen presentation (1.77:1) enhanced for 16 x 9 TVs<br />* Audio commentary with writer, producer, director Eric Weston and star Clint Howard<br />* Theatrical trailer<br />* Poster and still gallery",4
I generally purchase Illy or Medaglia D'oro Espresso coffee beans and will be returning to those products.  We found that the Lavazza beans lacked the flavor and aroma of the products we had been using.,2

"I love hot cider, however this one didn't taste great to me. The artifical sweeteners spoils the taste. When it brews the caramel apple scent is just wonderful, and makes you want to try it, but I think it would taste much better if no sweetener was added and you could sweeten it to your taste.",2
"I bought the 2-pack of this product as I love to use garlic but hate peeling the stuff, so I use garlic powder extensively in my cooking. I bought this product thinking, wow this will last a long time and since it's Durkee it must be good !<br /><br />This product is so salty that it ruined a whole pot of all-beef chili that I just made which is a terrible waste of time and money.<br /><br />I have used garlic powder for years and because I need to restrict my salt intake, I have avoided garlic salt for those same years which is easy to do when the product is properly marked.<br /><br />Since lots of people like garlic salt, I don't know why Durkee didn't just market this product as garlic salt which trust me, it is.  And salty garlic salt at that.<br /><br />If you're a garlic lover like me, avoid this product like the plague.",1
Great coffee.  Only thing I didnt like was it would only let me buy 2 and I love this coffee so much I wanted more!!,5
I got this in the spray bottle and it works just as poorly.  I shake the product around my plants and it works fine until we have a dry spell and everything is withered except my garden.  Then NO-thing will prevent critters from raiding your watered plants.  What a disappointment.,2
"Despite being sold under the same label, the Lea & Perrins available in the U.S. is NOT the real thing - as others have noted, it contains high fructose corn syrup. Aside from high fructose corn syrup being ridiculously bad for you, it does change the flavor. Not to mention, it's a false claim, as the American version is not 'the original'. See if you have any friends in England to send you the real stuff :)",1

"I love roasted seaweed, and had purchased the Sea's brand on amazon several times. I wanted to branch out and maybe get a better bang for my buck so I tried these. They didn't compare. The seaweed itself was all stale; it lacked the crunch of other roasted seaweed. I supposed I could have tried adding strips to soup or something, but I really just wanted something I enjoy eating directly. I don't know if I just got a bad bag, but I don't think I'm going to try another one. Too bad, I loved the idea of the small wrapped portions that would fit in the pocket.",2

Considering Mrs. May's markets itself as a healthy product, I was shocked when I glanced at the back and noticed this product was made in China. China has proven that we can not trust their manufacturing practices. Unsafe toys, dog food, and now we're supposed to trust them making our health food?<br /><br />Not to mention the carbon footprint created by shipping something halfway around the world. I will not buy this product anymore.",1
"This is a cool organic fruit snack great for all ages not just kids.  I was looking for an organic fruit snack for my sons lunch box and this  is prefect.  Great prepackaged, keeps well, no refrigeration required. Great for  on the go, lunch boxes, camping, picnics, anytime.  I can keep organic fruit on the shelf now ready anytime.<br /><br />We are never put off by labels like for tots or babies ,unfortunately  most of the organic snacks seem to be geared toward them.  My son loves bananas and apple sauce, so we thought we would try this.  So he calls this his  banana sauce.  He even wanted to freeze it . So we popped it in freezer and then cut off the bottom for a banana sorbet. He loved it.<br /><br />Also he loves the caps and is collecting  them to make something. They have holes so could be strung together.",5
"These are expensive (I would guess the 24 oz pkg contains maybe 20 sticks), but you can cut or break them in half (harder to break smaller pieces off) to make them last longer.  They're a huge hit with our two big guys - have to admit I was shocked at how quickly our big dog consumed one when we first opened the package!  I like varying protein source, so they split one each morning along with a mix of other snacks - it's a real treat for them, and Made in USA is a BIG plus for me as ""Mom.""",4
"I am disappointed in the description of this product on Amazon. But I have to blame myself for the purchase because I could have gone to the Mariani website and seen that they DO NOT call these ""Dried Apricots"" [http://shop.mariani.com/Mediterranean-Apricots/p/MAR-1140091&c=Mariani@OrchardFruit].<br /><br />The product listing mainline on Amazon is: ""Mariani Premium DRIED Ultimate Apricots 48 oz. Resealable Value Bag by Mariani"" [caps are mine]. (That line is repeated also in Amazon's ""Product Features"".) The ONLY place on this product's bag that the words ""Dried Apricots"" appear is in the INGREDIENT list.<br /><br />The front of the bag says, ""Premium - Intense Flavor and Aroma - Ultimate Apricots,"" and the back of the bag says, ""We've taken our most luscious Mediterranean Apricots and infused them with a natural flavor essence to create Mariani Ultimate Apricots"". Few of the apricots would qualify as ""dry"" compared to the dry apricots I've eaten my entire life (a long time) and some of them are almost mushy. When you open the bag it smells a bit like a fruity wine. No, I don't think they have fermented, I just think the odor is that special, "". . . natural flavor essence"" that the MANUFACTURER adds to the DRIED APRICOTS!<br /><br />Although I don't like to publish ""indelicacies"", these are also the first dried fruit (including prunes) that ever gave me the bends from gas. I am not suggesting that will happen to everyone, but after eating some (a reasonable number) of them 2 days in a row and being symptomatic, then eating none and not being symptomatic, then repeating the process, I am a bit beyond buying into the theory of coincidence as a cause.",1

"I switched to Royal Canin foods while my cat was still a kitten.  It didn't seem to be a difficult transition for him.  With the Intense Hairball formula the size of the hairballs has been dramatically reduced.  One bag seems to last a really long time so I think it must be filling for him.  I like the way the Indoor Beauty 35 makes his coat feel, but I think the Intense Hairball 34 is a better choice for him.",4
"I really had high hopes for this product, but I am sorry to say that I have no idea if this works or not. I have the pickiest dog ever, and she turned her nose up at them! I have to admit though that after I smelled them, they didn't smell too appetizing.",1

"This one--the Office Pro gets two stars only because it lasted more than a year.  The first one (the Platinum) died about three days before the warranty expired so Keurig replaced it (short cups, descale light came on even when descaled the day before, etc.).  Second one lasted about six months--died of the same unnatural causes.  I gave up since reviews for other single serve brands weren't much better in terms of reliability, but after a few months of making a full pot of coffee and throwing half away (and waiting around for it to brew), I tried again.  This time I got the Office Pro since those reviews indicated it was more reliable.  That was just over a year ago.  It began to die about a month ago.  Again, short cups and descale light comes on even though it has been descaled using the recommended descale products. I descaled it yesterday for roughly the fourth time in ten days.  Second cup I brewed after the descale was short. Four cups of coffee later the descale light is on again. Given how much I spent on these machines and how short the life span is, I figure I could go to Starbucks every day and still save money.  For now I'm using the AeroPress until I figure out if any of the single brew coffeemakers are worth the money.",2
"If you're taking a lot of calcium, you'll need additional magnesium.  This Natural Calm powder is a very good source of that magnesium.  My wife is taking calcium and was suffering from severe feet and leg cramps (especially at night).  A little research pointed to magnesium to help with this.  As with calcium, the citrate form is best for absorption and that's what this Natural Calm provides (magnesium citrate).  After just a couple of days of use, the cramping seems to have disappeared.  One additional benefit is that certain digestive end processes seem to have smoothed out, too.<br /><br />I have only two problems with the product.  First, this particular flavor of Natural Calm neither tastes nor smells all that great:  it's sickly sweet.  However, there is a non-flavored variety which is great (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OQ2DL4"">Natural Vitality - Natural Calm, oz, 16 powder</a>).  Also, it would have been very nice if the bottle had included a little plastic teaspoon scoop for measuring the dosage.  I've subtracted one star from my rating for those.  But, still, I rate this at a Very Good four stars out of five.",4

"My dog is 12, and has had constantly firm stool his whole life.  After a dental surgery, I used these, and assume the medicine was giving him diarrhea.  After he was better, and no more pills... I was still using these leftover pockets to smear into an old hollow bone (they are very pliable and many are cracked and smoooooshed, already, prior to opening the package), and he continued to have diarrhea.  I was just worried something happened due to the mediciation, but finally put two and two together.  Googling these pill pockets, diarrhea is a side effect.  So be aware.  These work well for the pill part, but the drawbacks are there too.<br /><br />Also, I haven't talked about diarrhea this much in my whole life.  I have heard the only time it's good to have diarrhea is in scrabble, because it's worth a crapload of points. I saw someone on Twitter ask Greenies if Diarrhea was a side effect.. the question is hilarious: [...]<br /><br />Anyhoo... we love our dogs.  We hate messy poop.  There may be better ways.  Making the poopy that loose makes me think it can't be too healthy?",2
"From the look of it, Taco Bell's new ""Bold and Creamy"" Chipotle sauce looks like it may be a spicy-cheesy concoction fans of quick-serve Mexican food would enjoy. This is deceiving. The pastel orange color masks its true nature: it is essentially a remixed BBQ sauce. The BBQ-inspired taste is so strong that it actually drowns out the chili pepper, garlic, and other spices Taco Bell blended with its chipotle recipe.<br /><br />This product is made to be used with tacos hard and soft. That being said, the reviewer tried it with a ham and cheese sandwich as well as a taco. It made no difference either way. The BBQ flavor will make itself fans or critics based solely on how the consumer feels about the southern staple's fusion into Mexican food.<br /><br />The packaging is clean looking and attractive. The Taco Bell logo is at the top, with an appetizingly loaded hard taco taking up a good 60 percent of the label. My sole gripe is that while the name (chipotle) refers to smoke-dried jalapeno peppers, the sauce has no kick to it. Taco Bell ought to do more market research on consumer preferences for ""bold"" being synonymous with hotness in this style of cuisine. Fans of old school Mexican-American food should pass on the disappointingly one-dimensional Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce, 8-Ounce (Pack of 6).",3
"I hadn't had a moon pie in many years, suddenly I was craving one, so I bought this variety pack.  I prefer the minis to the regular size, they are less messy and you still get the taste of the marshmallow, cookie & flavor (chocolate, banana, vanilla).  My only complaint is that I would like to be able to choose the flavors that I want in the box.  I prefer the banana & vanilla flavors over the chocolate. The box contains 2 boxes of 12 ea chocolate & one box each of vanilla & banana.  I would have liked to choose 2 each of banana & vanilla flavors.  I will probably order it again, anyway.",4
"Really did not like this flavor at all. It had a cheap, Easter chocolate taste to it and was sort of greasy. I do like the other Russell Stover items but this one I gave away. The quality was not there at all.",1
"See the title, this is just plain old Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, just like if you prepare the canned variety.

This may have just as well come in the can.",3
"Describing this material as ""cranberry tea"" seems unfortunate.  It is merely bitter black tea with a few shreds of something not definable. Perhaps I should have realized from the picture that it would have no cranberry flavor or scent and ordered the cranberry-apple instead.  I will return it to the company and they can compost it, because that is its only value. Laurence",1
"(PRODUCT LINK: ASIN: B0018CE77Q)<br />Cotton ran really fast to his dry food bowl when he got a sniff of this!  And I am speechless; his love affair with this continues.  The company doesn't have wide-enough distribution, but deserves it.  They make a splendid product.<br />However, Amazon has it.  Bet you can't guess where the reorder will be sent!",5
"Let me just say that this tea is about average. I feel like the tea wasn't made to high standards, but then you have the fact that they're whole leaves. I think this creates a weird situation where you have a bad product of high quality. I'm a supertaster, so I will describe the product as best as I can. It has your typical oolong bass notes, but the higher notes are very grassy (sometimes oolong is sweet, bitter...etc etc etc, this is grassy). It has a fair balance between bitterness and boldness. Incase you aren't gathering what I'm trying to say... it's a very neutral flavor and doesn't really 'wow' me at all. The grassy flavor taste exactly like wheaties cereal (no frosted).... and that sounds stupid but when you try it you'll instantly make the connection.<br /><br />So, in conclusion it's a plain tea that I won't really hold up high on my tea shrines, but it does have one last unique quality. It taste odd, but I can't stop drinking it. It's like raman noodles... you never say ""man I can sure go for some raman"", but when you are actually eating raman you make sure you eat every last noodle. It's like that.<br /><br />12/10/11 EDIT: After drinking a few of these, I can say that it's a great tea to drink without anything added. I normally add sugar to most of my teas in some way or another (honey, sugar, guava), but I find that this tea is actually really good without anything added. I'm not going to officially change my 3 star rating, but I am tempted to bump it up to 4 stars.",3
We loved Zatarains pre-mixed jambalaya with sausage that you just warmed up and it was ready to eat. Absolutely delicious. This product has absolutely no resemblance in taste to that product whatsoever. It doesn't even hold a resemblance of taste to jambalaya in general. I made the mistake of buying a dozen boxes and they are all in the trash now. NEVER buy a Zatarains product again.,1
"I can see why this flavor would stir controversy.  Personally, I very much like the flavor, although I do not think it is Timothy's best flavor.  That being said, I have found that time and again, Timothy's coffees are richer and better flavored than most of the brands that I have tried (and that is many).  I have this on auto delivery and will keep receiving it.  I normally drink this coffee in the afternoon and sometimes at night.  I prefer Columbian or expresso or any other stronger coffee in the mornings.  As for smell as other reviewers have stated,  I do not find it offensive.  I even brewed a cup, went outside, came back in and smelled the kitchen.  Nope, it did not bother me, and in fact, I thought the kitchen smelled good.  (I have an exceptional keen sense of smell.  My family can attest to that).  I believe that all flavored coffee is subjective and some coffee flavors appeal to the majority and some will not.  Thanks Timothy for great coffee!",4

"I purchased Zuke's mini naturals in the Chicken flavor based on all the amazing reviews I had read on Amzon.com. Not only I was so pleased with thisproduct, so was my lil 4 months old lab pup! My husband and I used these mini treats for training and rewarding. The product was a great value as well. Just because each individual treat was so tiny and there were so many of them in one bag...it would've lasted a lot longer...if my mischeivious pupppy didn't get into the bag when my husband and I were gone...Yes, he loved these treats SO much, maybe too much that he ATE the ENTIRE BAG!!!! I was really concerned at first when we found out he had eaten almost a full bag (I bought the 1 lb bag about 2 weeks ago, so it wasn't completed full but there were still A TON of left in the bag). But, I was a little bit relieved knowing at least this product was made out of all natural and high quality ingredients. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 start was although the treats were made out of all natural and high quality ingredients, the smell was AWEFUL! My husband wouldn't even reach into the bag to get the treats...and after I gave these treats to my puppy, I had to wash my hands to get the smell off. That was my only complain about this product, otherwise, AWESOME product! I didn't plan on purchasing another 1 pound bag that soon but since my pup ate em all, I'll have to buy it AGAIN!",4
"I found the coffee in a single serving pod to be pretty weak for an 8 oz cup.  Since I don't have this style of coffee maker, I opened the pods and poured them directly into the coffee filters I normally use to make coffee.  Two packages makes a pretty tasty, full bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />My biggest concern with this product was the incredible amount of packaging for very little product.  15 small pouches of coffee, wrapped up like tea bags, each one individually packaged in a foil packet which are all placed in a fairly large box.  The box is wonderfully designed with multi-colored, foil embossed design (it would probably make a great gift for your favorite Bob Marley fan), but the amount of packaging is unbelievably excessive for, maybe, six or seven ounces of coffee.  The elaborate declarations of ""fair trade,"" ""ethical treatment of farm workers,"" ""biodiversity"" and ""sustainable cultivation"" (among other first world catchphrases) ring hollow for me.  This all may be true but it's hard not to be cynical and slightly suspicious of the true motivations for the lofty rhetoric on the box.<br /><br />The company's declaration of ""we believe that pure food from the earth is physically and spiritually beneficial,"" sounds absurd when compared to the amount of waste in the packaging of their product.  How pure can it really be after it has gone through this much processing?",3
"I usually do not bother to write any reviews as I think there are enough reviews already that one more makes little difference. Not in this case. I do not know what the people who wrote about this tea before me drunk or smoked (e.g. Kasia S., et al). I wasted hard earned $16 on something that even does not taste like a regular cheap washed out tea bags one can buy at any no-frills grocery store. If you never had a real Oolong Tea (like Pete's Phoenix Mountain Oolong) you may be fooled into believing that Oolong Tea tastes like this product. I think it sucks big time and I think potential victims should know the truth about it. This is how I use reviews for other products on Amazon to get an honest assessment of something I am thinking of buying. I am giving away all 5 boxes of this tea to people I do not know as shipping it back would waste additional time I do not want to donate.",1

"Just when i got my shipment i tried it out on my pit but he only ate portion of it and he never ate it after that. So i also tried it on my rottweiler and she does not like it also.

"This soup was much thinner than I expected.  I also agree about the lack of a visible expiration date, although with dried beans and spices the worst result would be blandness.  Fair value for what was received, but not worth buying again.",3
"Definitely fruit punch, reminiscent of Hawaiian Punch (a flavor I remember from my childhood). This drink additive sports a full days RDA of vitamin C and nearly half of the RDA of four B vitamins, no sugar and an unknown quantity of caffeine per tablespoon serving size.<br /><br />I am a big advocate of B vitamins for stress relief, but cannot say that I have ever felt an energy boost from taking B-complex, and see the same lack of effect from this additive. I drink it daily on my way to the gym and, honestly, haven't seen much effect from this product other than the flavoring in my water. Maybe, those that do not regularly take a B-complex or drink the 2-3 cups of coffee that I do will feel more of a boost. The lack of B9 (folate) seems like an oversight being such an obvious benefit to women of child-bearing age.<br /><br />Overall, I can drink it but don't see myself going out of my way to buy more. P-)",3
I'm a big fan of Parmalat Milk before finding I could order this. I placed a order only to recieved a leaked garbage clear bag full of rotten milk which has leaked. I'm quite baffled that these could be delivered in this fashion and it poses a health hazard. I never recieved a refund to this day despite be going threw all the lines. And I would advise someone take caution before receiving huge flies pop out of a garbage bag with busted milk cartons.<br /><br />Love the milk but this is clealry not acceptable or else I would order in frequency. To this day still no word from amazon or the vendor.,1

"For the flavor, I will give it 5 stars. No need to explain. The coffee is Irish Creme without alcohol. So nice....<br />However, the packaging is bad. I give it 0 stars.<br />So over all, I rated it 3 stars.<br />192 creamer cups are loose in the big brown box. After long way to our door, some creamers are leaking and made other creamer cups sticky. All 192 creamer cups came in with brown manufacturer box instead of the one showing on the Amazon product page (please refer to the pictures I shared). Besides, the shelf life should be 6 months according to the customer service from International delight, but I ordered on May 29, 2011. The package was received on June 3, 2011. However, the creamer Expired on 08/10/11. I only have 2 months to consume 192 creamers.<br />I guess it is why the price is good. Something needs to be sacrificed!",3
"This was not as good as I expected. The small 8oz can packs a whopping 140 calories & 33 g of sugar ( albeit natural fruit sugar)! The flavor is mild but very sweet. The lack of high fructose corn syrup and caffine is a plus,however I think the price is very high for this product.",3

"I discovered this tea at work one day and have been drinking it for the past 25 years!  It's just awesome - you don't even need sugar - just some hot water and voila! Instant licorice flavor.  If you're not familiar with Stash's teas, then be sure to give this one a try.  They have wonderful, rich flavored teas, not too strong or too weak.  They come in a zillion varieties and all just equally as good.  Sign up for auto delivery on this one - you'll be back for more.  Highly recommend!",5
"A reliable brand. When I was shopping at a major warehouse store (gee who could that be lol) I discovered they sold this and loaded up my cart with Tone's. I buy gourmet brands too but I like having my shelf full of Tone's products for everyday use or backup. Flavorful, long lasting, and considering its a dried item as close to fresh as you can get.",5
I have purchased these in the past and enjoyed them. This whole box is old. the flavor is off badly.,1
"These barley teething biscuits are very similar to the wheat ones by the same brand. My baby seems to really like them. They're hard enough that they don't break apart or dissolve too fast. I can say that, to me, the wheat are sweeter than the barley. I personally think barley anything tastes absolutely disgusting, but like I said, my baby likes both flavors. At first, I didn't understand why they were wrapped in packs of two, but then I realized that the first one is undoubtedly going straight to the floor, so a replacement is necessary or tears will ensue. Great product, good price, organic! So no worries.",4
"This is the only Kool-Aid flavor I can drink on a regular basis. The color is very appetizing to me, and it has a lot of flavor. I tried it a few months ago when it was advertised as a new flavor in my store. I bought it regularly, but it suddenly disappeared. None of the stores near me carry it. I really don't understand why, it always sold out quickly.",5
I am very pleased with this product. I use it in the treatment of gout and I believe that it has been highly effective. I recommend the product to most who suffer that ailment. I have not had another attack since using<br />the product.,5
"When I was gagged by the sweetness of this drink, I went looking on the box for ingredients. They are listed in this order: coconut oil, corn syrup, fructose, dextrose, sugar - before it goes on to list other things. That's all sugars and oil!<br /><br />I fell it's important to point out that this particular product should NOT be taken as typical of Timothy's other offerings. We LOVE Timothy's Columbian de-caf as well as some of their tea offerings.",1
"These are natural, healthy, freeze dried treats that are about the size of a half dollar and a half-inch thick. They're a little too big to fit in a Kong or the rubber mesh ball I put treats in for my dog so I give her these treats as a reward. The texture is just what you'd expect from something that is freeze-dried and they're quite crumbly so they will make a mess on the floor. Fortunately, my dog is such a hog that she wolfs up every last crumb. Obviously she loves the flavor but my dog isn't picky so I would be shocked if she didn't like these. I would buy these again although probably not very often due to the slightly high price which is  a little higher than what  I usually pay for treats. I most often get the Mother Nature biscuits made by Natura. I gave these treats four stars due to the price and the size being too big.

"For reference, my ""morning coffee"" is a doubleshot of espresso, hot and very lightly sweetened with brown sugar in the winter, unsweetened over ice in the summer.<br /><br />This morning, I had this, first on its own (ick), and then over ice (slightly better). There is no part of me that's tempted to replace my morning routing with a can of this, easy as it might be.<br /><br />Really, it wasn't horrible. It tasted an awful lot like the other big brand's version of this, which, unfortunately (and I know this sounds horrible), tastes to me like, well, like coffee smells when it's exiting the body. Maybe this is just me, but it's something of a turn-off, and is true for both that other brand and for this one.<br /><br />I didn't really enjoy the texture of this drink, either -- kind of syrupy and thick, when it seems like without cream it should be pretty watery. It was also waaaay sweeter than I would ever want my coffee to be, but given that I generally prefer an unsweetened cold coffee, I'm not sure how much stock you want to put in that.<br /><br />Overall, if you like that other brand's version of this product, I don't see why you wouldn't like this, but if you're hoping for something better -- I don't think this is it.",3

"**Vine Voices will receive a total of 3 Lickety Stiks in separate flavors; Savory Bacon, Braised Liver, and Savory Chicken**<br /><br />Above is the description given for the Lick Sticks and the reason that I made that choice. What I received is one lick stick, not three. My Dobie loves Bacon and Liver so I was really looking forward to receiving both and figured he may be interested in the chicken as well. When I opened the envelope and saw just one lick thing I looked at the shipping invoice and it said that the one stik was bacon flavor. So, although puzzled at the lack  of the other two stiks I figured that at least he was getting to lick one of his favorite flavors. Not to be. The tiny bottle, about the size and apprearance of a small roll-on deodorant stick, was labeled ""Savory Chicken Flavor"". I figured I would give it a try and held it for my Dobie to lick. He gave me a scornful look indicating that he failed to find it ""Savory"" and walked away. I tried several more times but he began to give me a look that meant his patience was running thin. He is a large Dobie and very strong so I heeded his message and apologized by giving him a treat that ensured his forgiveness. The lack of receiving three sticks, the shipping invoice labeled as bacon flavored and the actual tiny bottle of disgusting chicken something are all a mystery to me.",1

"Sun Maid raisins are the best brand of raisins on your grocer's shelf--period. These raisins are rather healthy for you. There is no fat, no cholesterol and almost zero sodium to boot! They offer fiber and potassium and that's good, too.<br /><br />However, this food is not an invariable substitute for a vitamin or other fruits with fiber, minerals and vitamins. They are relatively high in sugar (29 grams per 1/4 cup) and they lack vitamins. I'll have to take off one star for that.<br /><br />However, if you want a healthy snack or something to add to your breakfast cereal or oatmeal, these raisins are excellent. They taste great and they are far better than any candy to sweeten your food. Moreover, Amazon correctly notes that the raisins do not require refrigeration nor do they bruise or spoil easily.<br /><br />Note: There should be an expiration date printed on the bottom of the container. Eat or use these raisins before the expiration date so you get them while they're nice and fresh!<br /><br />These raisins are great for persons everywhere who prefer to feed their children fruits as a substitute for candy. They are perfect for people who want to sweeten their food with something 100% natural, too. Raisins provide us all with a healthy snack; and that's a huge plus.<br /><br />Highly recommended--to life!",4

I usually drink Twinnings earl grey.  I opted to try something new and i love bergamont so i figured DOUBLE BERGAMONT would be amazing. Well this tea smells amazing but it is very very weak.

There is an aftertaste that I'm sure is a result of the sucralose.  If I had known that this product contained sucralose I wouldn't have ordered it, but I couldn't find any ingredients listed on the product page.<br /><br />The packaging is convenient.

"After trying both the Illy and Starbucks canned coffees several times I have to say that I much prefer Illy.  It's not the taste so much as the smell of the canned/bottled drink itself.  While neither packaged coffee drink smells as pleasant as fresh brewed, I prefer the plainer scent of Illy over Starbucks which always smells faintly of ""gym bag"" to me. (though I'm at a loss of how to explain this)<br /><br />That said: the Caffe drink is not too bitter or tinny for coffee out of a can. Though it's not difficult to get a coffee on the go, these little cans are convenient for around town or packing on picnics or trips.  I've had this straight from the can, over ice, and with a little milk added.  It's not too sweet and is a nice pick-me-up.",4
"Looking for a cup of Java that doesn't bite?  Look no further, this is it!  A mild blend that many will find very pleasing.",4
"The package says that this is supposed to be practically break-proof, which I thought was perfect for my year-old Beauceron who is a pretty aggressive chewer.  Finally!  A toy that would make his brain work and keep him occupied.<br /><br />Three uses.  First one he very quickly discovered how to get the treats right out.  Second, he learned how to get the screw-off bottom to come off of the jug.  Third time - he chewed the plastic to bits by the time I got it away from him - and he was in the same room with me!<br /><br />I'm a dog trainer and only recommend high-endurance products for my clients.  This didn't even come *close* to meeting my expectations!  Total disappointment.  Will not buy another 'Premier' Busy Buddy toy for my chewer!<br /><br />At almost 3 years old, we still rely on the blue K9 Kongs, Holey Moley, and Everlast Treat balls to stand up to his strong jaws and chew drive!",1
Great dog food my dog has been on this food since she was a puppy and her coat has been always so beautiful and her energy level is out the roof. I recommend you give this food a try!,5
"I thought this was a good value.  Starbucks has a name, stores, and the price was good.  I should have saved my money and bought the equal amount of Dunkin Donuts brand whole beans cause it is so much better than this stuff.<br /><br />This coffee lacks even subtle character of Diner coffee.<br /><br />It is harsh on the pallet and coats your tongue.  French roast?  I never tasted anything this bad in France.  This is more akin to the coffee you may buy in India.",2
"My cat's are spoiled, I'm sure they aren't the only ones out there, but probably more spoiled than most.  The price of most cat treats and even some canned food is cheaper than Wally World, especially with a subscription.  These particular treats they love, until they get too many of them and then they want something different.  I tend to have four or five varieties on hand at any given time.  One cat seems to know that.  On any given day he knows what he wants but just looks at me until I figure it out.  If I just walk away, he will stalk me, or sit in front of the TV, or lay on the keyboard, whatever is most annoying until I give in and offer something else hoping I get it right.  I know, I'm whipped.  But be honest, if your thinking of buying these you probably are too.  Chances are good your cat will like them, mine do much of the time.  But they also like other flavors much of the time.  Price is a little more but packages are larger.  One strange thing with Amazon, different flavors of cat treats are different prices, even though they are all Temptations, Friskies, Party Mix, or whatever.",3
Puffins are a unique shape and taste. They have a great crunch like no other cereal. The bonus is that this flavor is gluten-free. I keep ordering them my the case!,5
"10 years ago my daughter brought home Creme' Brulee' for the first time. It was perfect, beans to be ground.  Since then I have searched for ANYTHING similar. When I realized I couldn't find it, she had forgotten what one she purchased.<br /><br />This one has a strong flavor, but it tastes fake with a strong after taste. Unfortunately it is one of the better ones.  If anyone reads this and knows what ones (Carmel and Vanilla), taste great, please post here.",2
"My beagle loves this treat.<br />The texture is like a cookie and is kind of perfect treat to break into pieces, stuff it in a kong toy etc.",4
"These are definitely a healthier alternative than your standard potato chip - each bag (roughly 20 silver dollar-sized chips) has only three grams of fat and 100 calories. They are also kosher, gluten-free and vegan.<br /><br />Instead of baking the flavor into the chip, Popchips add seasoning once the chips are ""popped"" (as opposed to fried or baked). This, however, is also the cause of my problem with the chips. I found the flavor to be wildly inconsisent from bag to bag, and sometimes from chip to chip within the same bag. One bag's lime flavor was so overpowering I almost gagged, while the next was a nice, uneventful snack. The lime flavor is also much, much more noticeable than the chili flavor.<br /><br />As a healthy alternative to potato chips, these are a viable option, but keep a glass of water handy - with the almost-randomized flavor intensity, you're not going to know how intense the lime flavor is going to be until you open the bag.",3
"What can you say about coffee, either you like it or you don't. I liked this coffee, although when I choose to review it I didn't notice it was decaf. That aside, it tastes fine (made in my Keurig) but if you want the kick get the caffeinated one.",4
"Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.<br />Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Everyday Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year.",1
"The product description says that this tea is 'slightly sweet' as well as a bunch of other descriptors, but I didn't get any sweetness at all. I was very optimistic because I normally love everything Tazo offers, but this time I had my hopes dashed.<br /><br />I brewed up a mug of this tea and was immediately alarmed at the bouquet. The teabag smelled different, but once the hot water hit it the smell seemed to really magnify. But I scooped in a few teaspoons of sugar and hoped for the best. I managed to choke down about a third of the cup before I called it a day. Life is too short to drink something you don't like.<br /><br />However, I had read a review that mentioned how good and palatable this tea was when combined with the Tazo Lotus. I figured it was worth a shot, otherwise I'd have to throw out this tea altogether.<br /><br />The Lotus smelled great, so I was excited. I blended the two bags (one Lotus and one Wild Sweet Orange) in a large mug, then removed the Wild Sweet Orange after a minute. I left the Lotus in for another minute or two (yeah, definitely two).<br /><br />The result was a very unusual, but not unappealing, beverage. Would I drink this more than once a day? No. Was it very interesting and something that I'll try again? Yes.<br /><br />Live and learn, I guess.",2
"Fast delivery and best price found online. Although half-caffeine, this coffee has a definitive taste with hopefully only half the usual caffeine, since it is the only Kcup I will try in the evening for fear of insomnia.  Works for me!",4
A coworker from El Paso turned me on to this.  His whole family eats this and I can definitely understand why now.  It's great if you like hot sauce and not as expensive as some others I also like.,5
Like most of the Loacker Wafer Cookies ... these are delicious ... just don't go overboard eating them ... they have a LOT of saturated fat in them!,4
I've bought this coffee for 6 years.  It has become bitter and tastes old.  Who is Melitta farming out their product to?  I was once a perfect cup of Java.,2
"This is like the perfect thirst quencher when you're tired of soda, but you'd like something with a little fizz. It's the right balance of juice taste, fizziness, and content: the 8-ounce or so can really DOES an incredible job of getting rid of your thirst.<br /><br />I tried the clementine and the blackberry. The latter is just amazing! Not too sweet, not too tart, just perfect! The clementine I liked slightly less (it was a little too tart for me), but it was still very good nonetheless. The added vitamins and natural contents are just bonuses to the amazing taste.<br /><br />The only reason this isn't a five-star review is because of the calorie count. This beverage would be perfect if only for that!<br /><br />Highly recommend (esp. the blackberry!)",4
"I can't quite decide whether this is something I'd want to get again. It just seems that for every Van Houtte product I like, there's one that I don't. All I can say for the brand in general is that I recommend getting a sampler pack rather than lots of the individual flavors until you know which ones you do and don't like.<br /><br />Flavor-wise, I can taste the vanilla. It's a little subtle at times, almost to the point where I would've missed if it I wasn't specifically looking for it. This isn't a game killer, as I actually don't like a strong vanilla taste with my vanilla flavored items. Those wanting something more pronounced will probably be disappointed. What I do like about the vanilla is that it doesn't taste artificial (what I can taste, anyway), which makes a big difference when it comes to whether or not I'd choose to drink this if I were to buy a box with this flavor in it.<br /><br />The coffee itself isn't bad. It's neither awful nor extraordinarily good. It's firmly ""in the middle"". I'll say that while I wouldn't avoid this K-Cup in the future, it's not like the Kaluha K-Cups to where I'd purposely go out of my way to purchase it.",3
"I drink a lot of coffee and ergo use a lot of sugar, but am trying to cut sugar out of my diet.  Although I will use Splenda, I am not fond of the aftertaste.  I've tried Truvia too, which also has an aftertaste.  I guess since none of these sugar substitutes are really sugar, they're all going to have an aftertaste.  So while this product is no different, the slight vanilla flavor helps to either cut down on the aftertaste or distracts your tastebuds from it.  One downside is that the bottle goes quickly for hardcore coffee drinkers, which probably more expensive than just straight Splenda.  Overall, I think it's a good alternative to sugar and would recommend it to those who are trying to cut down on sugar consumption.",3
"I bought this item based on such good reviews. I thought I would do some ribs in the stove using a smoker bag instead going out in the cold to use the barbeque grill, but what a mistake. I followed the directions exactly and all I got was a smoky house and smoky clothes. The ribs had a weird and faint wood taste not smoky like you get on the grill. YUCK! The ribs were the worst I ever tasted. I usually don't do reviews unless I feel it's necessary and this is one of those times. I really expected to have good results. I give this one TWO THUMBS DOWN.",1
"I really do like this flour for baking. Yes, it has a beany flavor, but only at first, it goes away once you bake your items. I can see how someone who is particularly sensitive to that flavor would not like it, though. I myself have had good results with it and just made some *awesome* gluten-free Blondies. No complaints from family members about beany-ness. I made bread with this flour and was not all that happy with how it turned out, but I am new at gluten-free baking, so it may just take some adjustment. I am especially glad that it does not contain xanthan gum, which I will not use because it is made from corn and is at high risk for being GMO. I just add guar gum when needed. But it does so well at baking cookies and muffins that I will definitely make it a staple in my pantry.",4
"As others have said, ""if you like your tea to taste like the smell of a campfire"", then this would be the tea for you.  I personally don't like it, but my friend loves it.  He calls it ""smokey tea"" instead of it's real name.<br />It's one of those things that you either will love it or hate it, there's no in between.  If you liked smokey flavored things, you will probably like this tea.  It does taste better with sugar in it too, kind of ""softens"" the taste, but make no mistake...IT'S A STRONG FLAVOR!",4
"This product is one of my go-to quick meals.  It's easy to adapt for different meats, and it is quite tasty.  I'm so thankful I'm able to order it online, since in many places Thai food is hard to obtain.  There are a few additional ingredients to add, but it's quick and easy to do so, and still a great savings over heading to a Thai place.",4
"In the search for a more natural and less waste-producing cat litter, I stumbled upon Feline Pine.  Since I could not find an official Feline Pine cat box to use with it, I decided to try the Tidy Cats Breeze litter box.  My cat seemed to like Feline Pine just fine, and the Breeze box seemed fine, too.  At first.<br /><br />As for the litter itself, the true subject of this review, I really like it.  I especially like that you can actually flush the cat poop down your toilet, since the pellets dissolve into sawdust when they are wet.  Although the pellets did seem to stick to the poop, it was still really easy to scoop out of the box and dispose of.  I didn't notice much tracking beyond a very close perimeter of the box, probably due more to her attempting to bury her waste than to the pellets sticking to her paws.  No tracking upstairs as with the old clumping clay litter, no ""litter box feet"" smell on the actual cat, and no more licking clay litter dust when she is grooming.  The odor of the box is not horrible, but it certainly doesn't mask the poop odor like clumping litter.  I didn't buy it for that purpose, and my box is in the basement, so no big deal.  The smell wasn't intolerable, just kind of funky.  Wet sawdust meets cat urine meets poop.  And, this litter is pretty reasonable and lasts quite a long time, in my opinion longer than a tub of clumping litter because you don't use as much in the box.  Ultimately, the litter is a great product if you have a proper box to use it with.<br /><br />Now, for the box.  I read many reviews where people mentioned using the Breeze box with Feline Pine.  And it does work.  Kind of.  The wet sawdust falls into the tray below and the tray can be emptied into the trash.  The solid waste stays on top.  Every time I scooped the poop I'd sift the box, bringing the dust down to the tray.  Then I would dump the tray and I was done.  Very simple.  The problem is that every once in awhile you really do need to clean the box.  I don't mean scoop, I mean clean, with actual soap and water.  The tray gets rather nasty with all that urine-soaked sawdust falling down there (sometimes I'd even have standing puddles of urine waiting when I pulled out the tray) and would benefit from a soap and water cleansing about once a month.  So begins the nightmare.  The box is hard to clean with this litter in it!  The pellets get stuck in the sifting grid, and I don't have a utility sink in my laundry room, so I hauled the box upstairs to the tub to try to ""rinse"" them out.  The pellets dissolve in water, right?  No, they don't dissolve!  They turn into sawdust!  Big mistake.  Don't be foolish like I was and try to put Feline Pine sawdust down your tub drain.  Duh!  It clogs the drain!  I ended up with a bunch of sawdust in my tub, which I then had to plunge out of the drain and scoop out with my hands.  Disgusting.  I should really have tried picking them out first and then washing the box.  Live and learn.  Either way, it is a huge pain to soap-and-water cleanse the box.<br /><br />I am deducting a star because Feline Pine makes a box specifically for this litter, but it's not available!  I guess you could use a regular box, but that seems an even worse option.  You'd have a ton of soggy sawdust sitting on the bottom, and the cat would end up digging in that.  Gross.<br /><br />Feline Pine, I need a decent box for this litter!",4
"are glucose syrup and evaporated cane juice? Just because these ingredients are organic doesn't mean they're healthy. I worry that we are giving our kids the implied message that sugar is good. We already eat a ton of sugar, as a nation, and I don't have to mention what our obesity rates for kids are.<br /><br />Why can't we get a wholesome alternative that doesn't have a ton of sugar in it?",2
"I won't buy it again. It sticks to my teeth so badly. And the taste is ok, nothing special and not really great for me.",1
"I saw these gummi bears in the vegetarian section.  To my amazement, they should not be here.  They contain gelatin which is an animal product and it is not vegetarian.<br /><br />Here is the definition from Wikipedia:<br /><br />Gelatin (spelled gelatine in some Commonwealth countries) is a translucent, colorless, brittle (when dry), nearly tasteless solid substance, derived from the collagen inside animals' skin and bones. It is commonly used as a gelling agent in food, pharmaceuticals, photography, and cosmetic manufacturing. Substances containing gelatin or functioning in a similar way are called gelatinous. Gelatin is an irreversibly hydrolysed form of collagen, and is classified as a foodstuff, with E number E441. It is found in some gummy candies as well as other products such as marshmallows, gelatin dessert, and some low-fat yogurt. Household gelatin comes in the form of sheets, granules, or powder. Instant types can be added to the food as they are; others need to be soaked in water beforehand.<br /><br />Buyers beware of the ingredients of products you are buying, just because it says it's vegetarian doesn't always mean it is.  Look up the ingredients just to be on the safe side.  I hope this is helpful.  Whoever posted this item as vegetarian needs to do a little more research on what ingredients are considered vegetarian.<br /><br />thank you,",1
"I admit that I am only reviewing this here because of my frustration with this product.  My store stopped carrying the old standby brand with the adjustable sift top and only carries this fancy labeled alternative now.  The holes are simply too big for fine salt; you cannot get good control if you seek perfection in your seasoning.  I have ruined more than one batch using this dispenser.  Unless you are extremely careful, you will oversalt your popcorn.",2
"This product might have the greatest nutritional profile in the world, but I will not be eating it again. Even after soaking in milk for fifteen minutes, the flakes had a dry (almost cottony) texture and a flavor worse than tofu.<br /><br />I had high hopes, because I like every other Special K cereal and food bar I've ever had, but this was a huge mistake, as far as I'm concerned.",1
"I have a 22-month old son who loves everything dinosaur.  Including this cereal.  The dino eggs are actually pretty cool... they're basically little pellets of sugar that dissolve when you stir in the hot water.  The outer sugar shell dissolves and what is left behind are these little colorful dino shapes.  There are probably about a dozen or so green, red and orange ""friends"" in each packet.<br /><br />Be aware, though, that you are paying a premium for these little dino eggs.  Each of these boxes only contains 8 packets as opposed to regular Quaker oatmeal that comes 10 packets to a box.",5
"This is great stuff and is cheaper, per serving, than the box of packets.  If you order two (six canisters) shipping is free.  The price has increased by a little more than 2 dollars since six months ago.  I hope it doesn't go up again soon.",4
"These were not good at all... too spicy. Too ""limey""... the crunch factor was really awful... felt like my teeth were going to break.  (Love the name... the chips were AWFUL!) Wound up throwing the bag away.",2
This cake mix is flavorful but tends to be a bit dry. What is really handy though is the COOKIE recipe on the back of the package. I think this mix would make a good cookie. I haven't tried it yet but I will since I recently purchased a case of this brand. What we did with the cake is serve it with ice cream and that helped the dryness factor. Also you can put it in a bowl and pour milk or cream over it and eat it with a spoon and it's pretty tasty that way. Thank goodness for frosting and milk!,3
All this hype about this stuff and it hardly did anything for me. The best one for me is AMP but I guess every one is different.  What works for one may not work for another.  It's best to experiment with different drinks until you find the one that does the job.,3
"I could not believe my eyes when the dog treats arrived.  I had not checked how much my $12 would buy, but there was 3 oz!!!!  That brings the price per pound to over $60.  Do I want to feed my dogs Kobi beef or Russian caviar? No.  And I surely will never buy this again either. What a mistake.  It baffles the mind that this product is in production.  It seems immoral to waste resources to dry tribe, put it in plastic lined foil bags and ship it.<br />Yes, one of my dogs ate it, the other not.  So save your money.",1
"I was really excited to order these crackers because my toddler liked them when a friend of mine gave her one, but I didn't realize that they were made in China. They dissolve really easily and are individually packaged, but come on now, do you really want to feed your child snacks that are made in China? It's up to you, but I know that I wouldn't have ordered it if I knew where it was made.",2
"My wife heard about this ramen a couple weeks ago, and we picked up a box based upon the rave reviews in Korea.  It's ok - not great, not bad - but certainly not worth the premium over Nong Shim's Neogori or Kimchi Ramens.<br /><br />Taste:<br />no strong chicken taste, no strong spicy smell.  The ramen is spicy, but more like a jalepeno spicy instead of a kimchi ramen spicy.  The difference is in the...sharpness...if that makes any sense.  Other ramens have a low and nice hot burn, this one has a quick hot burn.<br /><br />Noodles are ok - nothing particularily special.<br /><br />Basically, I think people wanted a ramen where you don't smell too much after you eat it.  This delivers.  You can easily eat this, have a beer, and noone would probably notice - no dragon breath.  If that's what you're looking for, then this will fit the bill.  No exceptional taste, but nothing which will repulse people if you go to a public place later.<br /><br />Would I order this again?  Probably not.  Personally, if I want ramen, I want something with powerful flavor, because I'm not going anywhere after I eat it.",3
"I bought this product on the strength of the reviews but after one or two days of taking it I had a bad reaction to it including dizziness and the onset of depression and anxiety. Someone mentioned that Maca is a strong her and made their heart race a little after taking it. Another person said their skin broke out in a rash. Yet another reviewer mentioned Alphalpha- which this product has and which is meant to be bad for some reason (I'll do the research later) My only interpretation personally for me as to why my body reacted to it is the chemical additives e.g silica which is a well known neurotoxin. I have a very sensitive central nervous system and thought I would take this to get essential nutrients. But I think the multiple combinations and the large quantities of each herb/veg was just too much. I have since binned it and I'm scared to ever try it again. Since then I've bought a juicer and juice cabbage, cucumber, carrots, celery and other veg everyday and that's worked out much better for me in terms of boosting my energy, memory and concentration than this nightmare powder did.",2
"Hello, I don't plan on using this particular item. In viewing this item at the time of purchase it didn't appear that any of the yellow plastic caps came loose.The picture made it appear all the caps stayed in the cups and twirled around. Then the instructions warn not to leave your dog alone with this toy. My whole purpose was to leave my dog alone and I wouldn't have to worry about any of the plastic caps coming loose. Actually, I'm sorry I bought it. However, I bought two of the squirrels in the tree trunk toys, one for me and one for a friend, and we're very happy with them.",2
"Introduced to Leonidas several years ago, on successive trips to Brussels I returned with the two other, more well-known brands (Godiva and Neuhaus), when I couldn't get to Leonidas before my plane left. My wife advised me that in the future it was Leonidas or nothing.<br /><br />They are machine-made so the price is not bad (as opposed to the hand-made varieties), but they are also made fresh without preservatives so they need to be eaten or refrigerated quickly. In this house, the refrigerator rarely sees the package.<br /><br />They are excellent and a treat you owe yourself.",5
"I am a huge vanilla flavor fan. I love anything vanilla flavored. So naturally, I figured that I would love this coffee. The aroma is great when I open the package and dumped the ground coffee into my coffeemaker. I had high expectations for this.<br /><br />The coffee itself, once it is made is actually only decent tasting. I could only taste a very small hint of vanilla in it and it might have been because of my creamer and not the actual coffee itself. It was a bit bitter compared to other coffees that I have had and very rich. I usually take my coffee with cream and a small amount of sweetner and never really had problems with it being still too bitter.<br /><br />Next time, I guess I'll just use more cream and sweetner. Don't get me wrong, this is not completely horrible and I still enjoy Starbucks. It just surprised me as how bitter it was.",3
"We purchased several containers of these seeds for makeing bread.  They were very fresh, the price was reasonable, and the taste was excellent.  We consider this an excellent purchase.",5
"I wish I could review this item, but having never recieved it, I cannot.  I am also unable to contact any customer service either in regard to this issue.  I realise this isn't the best forum for this, but I cannot get anywhere else to do so.  If someone could contact me about this matter, I would apreciate it.",3
"Ordinarily, I love Thai food.  I love peanut sauce.  Recently, I moved to the country and was disappointed that I cannot find peanut sauce in my local stores.  So, I came to Amazon.  I really didn't want 6 jars of peanut sauce even though it was the type I usually use.  Instead, I bought this jar.<br /><br />The price is right.  You only have to buy one jar BUT since the taste isn't good, it isn't such a good bargain.<br /><br />The first sensation to hit your mouth is of a strange sweetness - somehow a little unpleasant.  There is a vague peanut-butter edge but not enough to drown out the sweetness.  After you manage to swallow, there is a surge of spiciness.  All-in-all, all I can see is ick.",2
"Be prepared with the right equipment to make this tea, it can be as simple as a low cost french press or a suitable coffee maker. Suitable meaning something like a espresso machine or pod system where you won't cross contamination with coffee flavors.<br /><br />Once made the curiously strong tea has a nice aroma and flavor. Suitable for milk, cream, spice, or other additions.<br /><br />If you are not looking for a caffeine drink, I highly recommend giving this unique beverage a try.",4
"I got these Clif Kid Twisted Fruit snacks because I'm a fan of other Clif brand products (Clif Bars, Luna Bars, Luna Minis) and I'm always looking for healthy food that's easy to eat on the go.  Even though I'm not a kid, I do enjoy having convenient, go anywhere fruit that I can eat.  I have tried various dried fruits and fruit leathers, but they are always either too dry and tough or too overly sugared.  Clif Twisted Fruit is a nice compromise, while still being all natural.<br /><br />Each twisted fruit is about 70 calories and has the ""nutritional value"" of a piece of fruit (so says the label).  I'm not sure how they really transfer the nutritional value of actual fruit into a processed product, so I wouldn't recommend this as a fruit substitute, but it does taste good.  The Strawberry flavor I tried is tangy and not overly sugared like most processed strawberry flavors.  The twist is brownish red, like natural strawberry preserves, not bright red. It is sort of gummy like fruit snacks, but the texture is not dry and tough.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed these fruit snacks.  My husband did too.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good lunch/snack food for either kids or adults--both sometimes need to be tricked into healthy eating!",4
"This powder was not really what I was expecting. When I say that, I mean that I really didn't care for the taste nor the color. This was my 3rd order of matcha green tea powder (3 separate orders from 3 separate vendors). My first order was from MatchaTeaSource and was premium grade matcha green tea powder,I also paid a premium price for this as well as premium shipping costs. My second order was the Teavana DoMatcha, through Amazon and although I liked this equally as well, the price for a small tin of tea was also at a premium plus shipping. I then came across the VitaLife Matcha Green Tea Powder - the color was not the bright green I was expecting and the powder did not mix as easily as the other teas. The aroma I got from the tea was not pleasant and reminded me of fresh cut grass. I have been drinking hot green tea lattes and iced green tea lattes using the matcha green tea powder for about one year. I am saving a lot of money by not buying these at Starbucks and mine actually taste better. I use 2-3 tsp of the matcha green tea powder, 8 oz cold nonfat milk and one Truvia sweetener - I mix this using a latte whip or a martini shaker (if iced). It's awesome!",3
"The seasoning is too heavy. I will eat them, but only because I ordered a bunch.",3
"I would definitely recommend these coffee pods.  Senseo pods are very easy to use and they make quick, fabulous coffee.  They are especially useful to me because I live alone so making a whole pot of coffee is generally a waste.  With the vanilla pods, you can have flavored coffee with the same convenience and quality.  In my opinion, they are delicious.",4
"Backpackers need lightweight nutritious nonperishable meals.  One option is expensive specialty freezedried complete meals, which I usually find neither nutritious nor tasty.  Otherwise, you can buy inexpensive fairly fast cooking mixes in supermarkets and supplement with either vegetarian or omnivorous products.  These are the extremely light and the quickest vegetables available, and usually excellent flavor.  The reason they get only 3 stars is that unopened packages seem to deteriorate in months rather than years.  At least some went bad when my local Whole Foods moved them from a prominent display to various corners of the produce dept, where they did not seem to be selling.  The clear container makes the deterioration evident in the worst cases, but it may not be as tight as others.",3
"This is a little spicier than I expected, but we found it to be a good product.  Good accompaniment to egg foo yung, or other non-spicy dish.",4
I tried all the samples in the box when I first purchased my kuerig but there was only 1 or 2 that I really took a liking to. I like flavored coffees as I'm not a coffee purist and found this one to be very good. The vanilla flavor is smoothly blended into the coffee which makes for a nice smooth coffee. This will be my standard coffee from now on.,4
"I have tried two other flavors of Switch and found only this one (Watermelon Strawberry) tasted anything like the name suggests.  As with the other Switch flavors, Watermelon/Strawberry is decent, but not great.  As someone who loves fruit, I greatly prefer The Switch over Coke or Sprite.<br /><br />However, don't let the marketing fool you.  While this drink doesn't have high fructose corn syrup (which I hate), it is still very high in calories and definitely not good for someone who is on a diet and looking for an alternative to regular Coke.<br /><br />The main fruit ingredients in all Switch products are grape and apple.  Strawberry and watermelon on the lowest fruits on the list of ingredients.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the flavor of The Switch products I have tried.  However, I find the advertising slightly deceptive and would have preferred it to contain fewer calories.",4
"""Throat Coat"" is the best of the bunch with a nice licoricey flavor and ""Breathe Easy"" is my second favorite.  The others could be served at a Klingon tea ceremony with no apologies. However, I mix in a little honey, well a lot of honey, and this makes for a rather pleasant tasting beverage. Since consuming the TM herbal brews twice daily now for two years, I have avoided contracting Rigelian Fever despite several outbreaks as well as the common cold and flu.  Be sure to follow brewing instructions.",4
"Got a wellness dog treat before which the dogs absolutely loved. Then i bought this dog food... very weird. None of my four dogs like it. Sniff, and go away. Regardless how good it is... if it can't even appeal to the dogs, it means nothing. Only one of my dogs is picky about food; others love almost every brand; esp. the 1st time they try a new dog food.<br /><br />Not this one. Embarrassing for me cuz I've opened it and can't return it.",2
"My dog is a very aggressive chewer, and she really went to town on this bone! She loves it! Its the only thing I've gotten for her that she actually likes and has lasted more than a week. She still has put a significant dent in it already, after only two weeks, and you do have to watch for them shredding pieces off (small pieces are said to be all right to pass through, but anything larger than a grain of rice should not be swallowed according to the package). I dont know what I would do without this bone, this can keep her busy for a good long while when I'm working or cooking dinner or doing anything where i can't really watch her.",5
"My son loves AP, but it can be heavy to carry and heavy to ship.  I started buying it from Amazon last fall and having it shipped to my son at school.  It was a great deal then, still an OK deal but now the price has gone up about 25%.",5
"I drink tea every day, but I do enjoy the occasional cup of coffee every once in a while. Because of that, I can justify paying premium prices for good coffee. Let me tell you, this coffee is worth its weight in gold.<br /><br />I had actually purchased the coffee without realizing that the beans were whole-bean. I quickly purchased a grinder. The grinder came four days after the coffee did. If I had known how good this coffee was beforehand, those four days would have been torture.<br /><br />Mind you, I'm basing this review on the fact that I have only brewed one pot so far, but one pot was all it took. This coffee is amazingly silky smooth and doesn't leave a harsh aftertaste like other coffees. It's a little on the light side, so if you like your coffee strong, I'd recommend about 1.5-2 rounded tablespoons per cup.<br /><br />I am definitely a believer in Kona Coffee now. I will be buying more of this in the future for myself and as gifts, though I'll probably use it before I have a chance to give it out.",4
"This herbal tea is one of my favorites. I used to sweeten it using wild flower honey, very very amazing taste. I do not advise you to try it with sugar.",4
First time trying this popcorn. Taste has just a hint of butter that's really nice. Buying in bulk for one serve portion is a great money saver.,5
"This is the best dog food you could ever feed your dog.  I have a 12 year old German Shorthair Pointer and she's been eating Tast of the Wild for about a year now, and her coat is beautiful, shiny healthy,  she acts like a 2 year old, full of energy and spunk. She also does not have that bad dog odor. She actually smells good. I owe this all to this wonderful dog food. I fed her the expensive top of the line food  before and she didn't do well on it at all.<br />Spend the money on this food it's amazing.",5
I have had better and will most likely try another company next time.  I thought the favor lacked body.,2
"My Cats love it, I will order again.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFKHN8"">Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul Dry Cat Food for Senior Cat, Chicken Flavor, 18 Pound Bag</a>",5
"This looks like real food! The chicken is actual chicken shreds, not some amorphous grey paste. The other TikiCat varieties are similar - the fish looks like fish, you can see pieces of leafy greens, etc.<br /><br />My cats love this. They also love the salmon, chicken+salmon, ahi tuna, and all the ""tuna on rice with ___"" varieties. I calculated the % calories from protein (vs. from fat/carbs), because I'm looking for the cat food that has the highest %cals from protein. Of the five TikiCat varieties I checked out, Hawaiian grill has the highest %cal from protein, followed by Napili Luau and PukaPuka Luau. The ""tuna on rice with __"" do have some carbs, since they have rice in them, but I still feed them to my cats every now and then for variety (and because they're less expensive!). My cats love all the TikiCat varieties I've given them, and I feel comfortable feeding this brand of cat food to my cats, since I can see what it's made of, there's no weirdness on the ingredients panel, and everything I've heard about the company (Petropics) makes it sound like they're really environmentally conscious.<br /><br />GreenLittleCat did a review of TikiCat, including a picture of what's inside the can. They also did a ""natural cat food showdown"" where they compared a bunch of natural cat food companies' environmental practices, and TikiCat won! Google them, since I feel uncomfortable linking to an outside site. (I have no affiliation with GreenLittleCat)",5
I purchased this item and it only came with 6 different flavors instead of the 8 advertised. It is also 80% hot chocolates so if you are wanting to try the chocolate or mocha coffees pick another item instead of this one.,2
No appreciable difference from any other ketchup you would find on the store shelf. This is ketchup in all its glory.<br /><br />I will echo others.. I do not get why this is not the heinz standard ketchup. Why add something completely unnecessary to ketchup to sell it to people.,5
"I have been using this product for years. It was GREAT! But the last one I received in the mail was much more watered down. In the past it was quite thick and a very reasonably price. This does not seem to be the case anymore. I will continue to use this brand, but I will be shopping a new source for price and quality.",3
"I was really excited about trying BLK.  Boy, was i dissapointed!  I couldn't even get halft the bottle down!  Plus when I went online to read about it, I heard there is no nutritional value and it's not any better for you than regular tap water.  Feel like I've been scammed.",1
"Good price but this stuff is just too sweet for my liking. 80 calories a cup, 9 carbs, too much fat and sugar. The taste was good though so if you treat it more like a desert instead of an everyday morning coffee then you'll probably like it.",3
"This is undoubtedly my favorite flavor of chocolate. Every year I eagerly await the new batch. I bought 12 of these little gems this year, from Amazon, again. My big surprise was that this year my wife came back from Walmart (yes, we do shop there as well) and told me that they had the exact same Terry made Orange balls for $2.50 each plus our local tax. Now we have another dozen in our freezer, waiting for me. I can't wait.",5
"The San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast, 36-Count was a great value. This is my second time buying the SFB brand. I like the Fog Chaser much better and will stick with that one next time!",4
"The Switch soda's are a, mostly, excellent alternative to real soda. They cut out some of the worst traits of the major colas like: perservatives and added sugars. Don't let that fool you though, they aren't really a ""health"" drink due to the high calories. They have almost as many calories per serving as an average Coke product. This black cherry flavor has 130 calories.<br /><br />They are slightly more expensive than soda as well, and unfortunately the portions are smaller so if you are factoring this expense on dollar per oz you'll come up short with the Switch sodas. If you are more intersted in flavor than cost, these are definitely a better alternative to soda or fruit juice. The carbonation gives them an extra kick like soda, but they have the great sweet taste of juice without the acidic, artificially flavored taste of Coke or Pepsi products. I would take one of these over a Cherry Coke any day!<br /><br />I tested one can then decided to buy a whole case of 24. Packaging was very sturdy and weathered delivery well. That being said, it is a carbonated beverage, don't leave it sitting on your doorstep too long in freezing temperatures.<br /><br />Just to wrap up, I'd highly recommend them if you don't mind the cost to portion ratio, and aren't under the missimpression that it's a healthy beverage.",4
"I don't know where to start. I feel like cheated. This product is described as ""Pure Premium Coconut Water"" but it tastes more like little bit of coconut oil mixed with water and served in a cheap plastic container. This product does not at all taste like coconut water. When you take a sip the first thing it reminds you of is ""Plastic"".<br /><br />I have tried many brands of coconut water and this by far is the WORST. I have grown up drinking coconut water fresh from the shell. So I know the real taste. See my  review for ""Vita Coco"".<br /><br />I had seen all the recent negative reviews. But they all suggested that there was a problem with one particular batch. I also noticed that Amazon had stopped selling this to investigate the problems reported in recent bad reviews. So when this product again came up for sell I trusted that Amazon has addressed the issue. I was always attracted to the packaging and wanted to try this for some time. Plus there was 15% off coupon. So I went ahead and ordered a case. Big Mistake!!<br /><br />Amazon does not accept returns for this product. So only thing I can do is ""vent it out"" through this review. This is my first negative review and I believe Zico absolutely deserve NO STARS. I am giving one star because Amazon does not allow zero stars.<br /><br />BTW, the case I received has expiry date of Dec 2011. I want to see reviews from other shoppers who have bought this along with me.",1
"I did not like this product for three reasons:<br /><br />1) Taste - putting everything else aside, this stuff tastes terrible.  It is fruit punch flavored, and I generally don't mind fruit punch.  But, this is really very fruity and reminded me of those horrible sugar drinks we used to drink as a kid.  I really found the taste hard to get past.<br /><br />2) Dispenser - the product makes a big deal about the one squeeze per 8oz of water (a standard side water bottle).  It didn't work because there is no indication how big a squeeze to give.  I was expecting something like is found on Act mouthwash.  One squeeze could be a couple of drops or most of the bottle.  There is also no way to see how much is left in the bottle because of the opaque wrapper.<br /><br />3) Questionable benefits - The label says this stuff adds vitamins C, B3, B5, B6 and B12, caffeine, taurine and electrolytes.  It gives odd measures of each benefit - sometimes as a % (presumably of RDA) and sometimes as mg.  For electrolytes it says it has two lightningbolts worth.  Most of this stuff you can get easily elsewhere from a normal diet.  Taurine has been proven to be of no established benfit.  Caffeine? Well, I can't really comment on why you would want that in an energy drink.  Many of these ""benefits"" are also not clearly placed in an energy drink or a recovery drink.  I have absolutely no idea how many electrolytes are contained in two lightningbolts.  It is not a measure I am familiar with.<br /><br />Two stars, not one, because it did not make me sick or anything.",2
"I love this tea.  All of a sudden, I was having a difficult time finding it in stores.  A friend suggested I look on Amazon.  Not only did they have it, but if I order a case (6 boxes) and have it shipped to me regularly (as far out as every 6 months), I ended up getting it shipped to my house, no tax, at a phenomenally low price compared to what I was paying in stores.  Great way to purchase this product.",5
"I love amaretto and almonds, but the amaretto flavor of this tea reminds me of cough syrup. Not a fan.",2
"I wanted desperately to love, or even like this drink mix, but am not having success doing so. I love mint tea but this tastes all green tea to me. It's too strong a green and too weak a mint flavor for me to enjoy it. Every once in a while I'll try to tolerate a bottle again hoping I change my taste. It's not gross and so clearly is appealing to some people.",2
"Based on the many bags of dried Shiitake Mushrooms that I've enjoyed in the past, I made the obvious assumption that the 'shrooms bought from the Amazon website would also be of superior quality, much like the ones I've always purchased from the local Asian markets in my own neighborhood.  I just received my 1st order of dried Shiitake Mushrooms this afternoon, and was very disappointed to find that the contents were very dusty, with many broken mushroom caps and pieces, instead of whole caps.  The box that they were packaged in had been damaged, as well. While I'm not completely ready to place blame entirely on the purveyors of said 'shrooms, I do expect them to make it right or refund my money.  The mushrooms themselves, however, do taste fine and that is the most important aspect of this review.  'Nuff said....",3

"At first the dogs were confused and the golden terrified. But once they sniffed it and figured out how to lick it, they loved it. I think it smells awful, nothing like bacon. But the dogs appreciated it. It is a great way to give the dogs a treat without all the calories. One calorie to every ten licks. Just be sure to store it out of reach. I can see my basset counter surfing, grabbing it, and chewing it all up.",3
"I like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CEABE"">Canidae Dry Dog Food, Chicken Meal and Rice Formula, 5 Pound Bag</a> more than this flavor, and I suspect my pooch does too. We have similar tastes, is what I'm trying to say. The beef and fish meal gives her the worst fish breath imaginable. I don't know if the food causes her to want to try giving me face kisses more than normal, but every time she gets near me after eating this her breath is like a shotgun of stank.",3
&lt;...><br /><br />I found out about this just after feeding my pup.  Not happy at all.  Go to diamonds website to see all the brands involved in the recall.,1
It actually has a mild taste of a cinnamon roll!  I was somewhat skeptical but the product managed to deliver as advertised.  The cinnamon taste is not overpowering and there is even a slightly unctuous buttery taste just as one would get from a real roll.  I will be ordering again.,4
"I tried two flavors of Eat. Think. Smile. Granola, and this one was the tastier of the two (the other was Walnut Cranberry). I like cinammon, almond, and chocolate, and they taste pretty great together here.<br /><br />The only problem with this product is that, as a granola, it's SO DANG HARD! I mean, I like a firm, crunchy granola, but this one can induce jaw-ache if you munch too much at one go. Perhaps it's a candidate for dipping in a mug of coffee or a glass of milk, like a hard cookie?",3
"I bought the GN popcorn popper and the GN portion packs.  The popcorn looks, smells and tastes great!!!  But, there was way too much unpopped corn.  We had an event at the studio and I went through all 24 of the 8oz. packages I bought.  The unpopped kernels equaled over 8 cups!!",3
"As a native Southerner, I've eaten grits all my life but I'd never had yellow, coarsely ground corn grits before I tried Bob's. From the moment my family tried these grits about two or three years ago, we've eaten no other grits. We cook these grits every weekend, usually Saturday and Sunday mornings. Oh, we've tried a few good regional products, but they're just not as good as Bob's (for instance, Lakeside yellow grits are good, but because they're more finely ground, Lakeside is a bit too creamy, tasting almost like a corn porridge). I prefer the more coarse grind of Bob's yellow grits, and the flavor is exceptional. The corn flavor in Bob's comes through, but not in an overpowering way - not to sound like a geek foodie, but Bob's yellow grits have a fantastic taste and mouthfeel. It's hard to explain, but I recommend you try them. If you're not sure you want to bite off a bulk multi-bag purchase via Amazon, then check your local grocery store (Publix in the Southeast carries Bob's, as do many organic/gourmet grocers). Regarding price: Bob's Red Mill products aren't cheap, but the company fills a very unique niche (Gluten-free products, unusual flours, etc.) and I'm willing to pay the price to keep the company from disappearing. Plus, every product from Bob's Red Mill that I've ever tried has been superior, including these grits.<br /><br />Oh, and NEVER follow the cooking directions on a bag or box of grits - that's the primary reason non-Southerners think grits are nasty, because they make grits without the necessary amounts of butter, salt and milk or cream. Also, these are not quick cook grits, so it will take about 15-20 minutes from the time the water boils to achieve smooth, cooked grits. To feed four people (assuming you also have pancakes and a meat for breakfast), use three cups water brought to a boil, then gently shake about 2/3 cup of grits into the water. Once the water/grits combo comes to a boil, immediately lower the heat to simmer and stir frequently. [A note about lumps: if you don't stir often enough, you get lumps; if you dump the grits in, rather than shaking them in slowly, you get lumps.] Add two or three tablespoons of salted butter, then an unholy amount of salt. I'm afraid to measure how much salt we actually use (we salt to taste as we cook), but I would guess we use two or more teaspoons of salt. To avoid oversalting, start with one teaspoon of salt, taste when you're almost done, then add additional milk and salt to taste. Depending on how thick you like your grits, add additional water (we prefer to use 1% milk) to thin them out a bit. You can also add chopped bacon or country ham to your final product for flavor.<br /><br />A word about polenta: Any Southerner can tell you that grits left in a pot to cool become polenta... so go ahead, and impress your Yankee and West Coast friends by ""grilling up"" leftover slices of your breakfast for dinner. Remember, the Americas introduced corn to Europe (including Italy), so grits came first.",5
"It's okay, but I wouldn't buy it again.  My absolute favorite green tea is made by specialteas.com.  It's a decaf apricot green tea.  I always end up going back to that after trying other teas.  I've even gotten used to drinking it plain without any sweeteners.  A cup sounds pretty good right now!",3
"I like Dr. McDougall's soups and often bring them to work when I want to eat a quick lunch, or have a satisfying snack that will help me feel satiated all afternoon. I like the taste and texture of this soup. I don't find that it's too thick or too thin as others have written. You can always add either more or less water to get the texture that you're looking for. Beware that this soup container has 2 servings of the soup and so all of the nutritional information has to be doubled when figuring how many calories and how much sodium you're taking in. What I typically do is add only half the flavor packet to the container of soup. This way, I significantly reduce the amount of sodium. The soup is very high in fiber, relatively low in fat and will keep you satisfied for hours.",4
"Chips are good, but Amazon ships them in their original ""ready to ship"" box, which turns out is not really so ready for shipping. The box arrived in tatters; miraculously, the chips survived relatively intact. Hopefully will continue to be so lucky in the future.",3
"I feel good when I drink that herbal coffee,I'm not getting nervous like when I drink real coffee.It is good for every time of the day even the evening.The taste is like real coffee but it smells weird.I like the smell of the coffee beans and I really miss it.That's why I'm giving it 4 stars,because of the smell",4
"If you want a snack which is both delicious and healthy, this works. As for it stating, ""love at first bite,"" I can't say that. The berries were freeze dried which really didn't add much to the mix, taste-wise. Plus, the cost might be prohibitive for some, though for a special occasion, it probably would be a welcome change-of-pace treat. So, overall, it pleases just fine.",5
This product is very good and tasty. It was delivered in a very timely matter.,5
"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:35 Mins<br /><br /></span>MiO Liquid Water Enhancer is adult Kool Aid, for better or worse. However, a tip of the hat should go to the marketing team that developed the ""water enhancer"" description as well as the product's attractive logo and packaging. As far as water additives go, MiO stands out among its competitors.<br /><br />However, when it comes to taste, MiO fails to capture the subtlety of home brewed peach tea. The artificial coloring - Yellow 5, Blue 1 and Red 40 - transform a clear glass of water into a Kool-Aidesque concoction. I didn't care for the jaw-aching sweetness in my first sip or the chemical aftertaste that lingered on (and colored) my tongue.<br /><br />MiO offers six flavors: Berry Pomegranate, Strawberry Watermelon, Fruit Punch, Mango Peach, Sweet Tea and Peach Tea, the latter being the flavor I received from Amazon Vine to test. As you can see in my video, MiO is easy to use and quickly changes the look, smell and taste of plain water. Again, for better or worse, depending on your own taste.<br /><br />Each MiO bottle provides roughly 24 servings, depending on how strong you mix your drink. The ingredients are: water, Malic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Citrict Acid, Contains less than 2% of natural flavor, Sucralose and Acesulfame potassium (sweeteners), Potassium citrate, Yellow 5, Blue 1, Red 40, Potassium Sorbate (preservative).<br /><br />In summary, I didn't care for MiO's peach tea flavor, its artificial colors and its aftertaste. The product packaging is excellent and, should Kraft release another formula, I'd be interested in trying this again.<br /><br />Rating: Two stars",2
"I wanted to like this because it was so easy,but like other reviewers<br />said,it doesn't grow very well. It smelled like pesticides as well.<br />I bought 4 and tried 2.Both failed!

"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00141OWXU"">Dogswell Veggie Life Vitality Sweet Potato Chew Treats for All Dogs, 5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>A year ago these treats were perfect and my pooch loved them, ""just what the doctor ordered"". HOWEVER, the recent shipments have been of inferior quality, poor quality. The product is dried-up and as far as my dog is concerned, unacceptable. She refuses to eat the treats and walks away from them. While the expiration date is in 2012 the product has to be tossed, it is anything but fresh.<br /><br />What illuminates this even more is that the local pet store is now stocking these treats. At the pet store, the products look and are soft and well managed and loved by the pooch. Clearly the treats from the AMAZON vendor is without quality and may have been rejects.<br /><br />While the cost in the pet store is much higher, it is well worth it.  Proves that you get what you pay for. If  it is 'Happy Hips' that your dog likes go the pet store or perhaps AMAZON will find a quality supplier.",1

"This salmon jerky has the right texture, the right moisture and the right chewiness to be the perfect salmon jerky.<br /><br />Sadly, they completely messed it up by oversalting it, and then throwing more salt on it.  After eating a few packs in the evening, I actually woke up from thirst in the middle of the night and had to drink water.  Twice !<br /><br />I wouldn't feed this to my dog.",2
"Crunchy Nut cereal is definitely tasty.  For me, it's just a little too nondescript.  If I want a healthy cereal, I go towards a GoLean and add some raisins to jazz it up.  If I want to splurge with a little sugar I'll hit the Cinnamon Toast Crunch.  I thought this Crunchy Nut might fall in between and allow for a healthy, compromised, third option.  For very little Fiber and Protein (2g each), I needed to be more excited to dig in.  But it's just - meh.<br /><br />I couldn't go as low as three-stars because it is tasty and nutty, I just don't think it's found a spot in my regular cereal rotation.  If you don't focus on getting some protein or fiber out of your cereal, than this might be an option for you.",4
"I have a 5 month old chihuahua-mix puppy who absolutely loves this.  She also likes the Kong, but this lasts MUCH longer for her if I put two gnawhides on. I'm able to distract her and calm her in most circumstances if I have this toy handy.  It's definitely her most ""high-value"" toy.",5

I get a real kick out of 90% of American consumers that think everything spicy with a Mexican name is TexMex. El Yucateco products come from the Yucatan not the border. The wonderfully ripened chilies and the fresh flavor they produce is what sets this product apart from their competition. I beleive this is the finest brand of Mexican hot sauce on the market because you can taste the chilies as if they were picked yesterday.<br /><br />All 4 in this set pack some powerful heat however it is a digestable heat that will not trouble you down the road. Get the burn on your tongue and enjoy without any complications. I have been using these products for at least 10 years and they are quite common in our local Hispanic markets here in Arizona. This is a very good Internet price for the gift pack.,5

"These candies have a consistency of a standard caramel and a similar flavor inside, though not quite as sweet and slightly milky tasting.  The outside is coated in matcha powder, which is bitter by itself, but blends nicely once chewed.  They are individually wrapped to prevent oxidation of the matcha powder.  These candies are recommended for anyone who likes the taste of green tea.",5
"I like the taste of this product, but I have some suggestions:<br /><br />1) for strongest blueberry taste, use less than the 16 ounces of water that the instructions indicate (my first try came out like water with the merest hint of blueberry);<br /><br />2) stir REALLY well and be prepared for a bit of sediment anyway, as well as for an oddly green (I know it's green tea, but I rarely drink green things, so it seemed a bit weird to me at first); and<br /><br />3) if you're going to use a sweetener, why cancel out the health bennies by adding something like aspartame or Splenda or etc? I added a bit of agave nectar and found it perfect, but then I also like it without any sweetener at all (as long as I use less water).<br /><br />By the way, this makes hot tea as well, although it's marketed as iced tea powder.<br /><br />Enjoy!",4
I keep buying these grape laces even though they are a little hard to chew.  They have a good grape flavor.  I just wish they were softer to chew.,4
"This stuff is great. Along with some lemon and Splenda, this flavorful addition to my tea is pure heaven. I buy it in large quantities for fear something will happen and I can't get any--that's how precious it is. I don't drink it regularly, though I could, and each time I have it, it's a wonderful experience. I've also had it with warm apple juice, and that's great too!",5
"I didn't order from Amazon, but picked up in the grocery store.  Not a bad product, I just wish there was a sugared version of the mix.  ""Health nuts"" aren't the only people who desire convenience...  Not sure why this pops up in electronics or with an iPhone case picture...",3
"I've done hours and hours of homework on high quality, grain-free dog foods.  From product analysis, kcal analysis, ingredients, customer reviews, professional reviews, company recalls - all of it... I have become a mini-expert in the field.<br /><br />I was pushed into becoming an expert because my yellow Lab kept having seizures and I couldn't figure out the source.  I finally learned it was her food, which was the most expensive store bought brand my local Sams Warehouse carries.  I thought I was giving her the best, it looked fresh and rich, but it turns out it was just absolutely terrible food.  My black Lab also had terrible skin allergies, to the point where I would get a small rash on my skin if he laid next to me on the couch for more than 5 minutes at a time.  I had no clue it was because of the food.  But it was!<br /><br />Since having that epiphany and learning so much about dog food, I've always made sure to feed them the highest quality grain free food I can buy.  This Taste of the Wild (TOTW) fits the bill very nicely, and they love it.  Since switching to a grain free diet, the yellow lab has not had any more seizures in over a year, and the black lab has the silkiest coat you've ever seen and his skin allergies are completely gone.<br /><br />They are on 2/3rds dry and 1/3rd wet combination.  Contrary to what I had previously been raised to believe, a wet diet is not bad for dogs but in fact is superior!  I use the combination to save money while providing them the best I can.<br /><br />Before deciding on TOTW, I had also tried Blue Buffalo, Wellness Core, and Orijen.  Briefly: they are all good foods, but my labs were happiest on TOTW and my wallet is also happiest on TOTW.  I also believe TOTW has a better formulation for them and their life style (some of the products, like Orijen, are simply too rich for the average household dog, despite being made of the best ingredients available).<br /><br />Enter TOTW.  The dry food is dark and rich, with no sign of crumbling.  The kibble is a good average size.  The wet food has nice chunks of meat and the right amount of gravy.  I use the wet food as a topper to mix the 2/3rd dry and 1/3rd wet together for their meals.  I use one whole can of wet per meal with my pack, which is convinient so I don't have to store it in the refrigerator - btw, never store canned dog food in the fridge in the original aluminum container!<br /><br />I still wish I could find a less expensive product with the same quality, but in the mean time, TOTW is the best choice for my pack.",5
"Luv, luv, this granola...the only thing is that I received 6 big bags that expired in 5 weeks which is alot to eat for this single lady.",5
"These gumballs were fine, but QUITE spendy in comparison to sugar gumballs.  My kids were very excited to have them for their gumball machine.",4
"I have a four month old st Bernard puppy and have always fed him and my 6 year old German shep hill science.  I did some research and found out how awful that stuff is.  I always thought expensive meant good.  Even my picky gs eats this with no canned dog food or any other incentive.  Of course the puppy will eat anything, and everything, lol,but his coat is beautiful and I have not had any digestion problems.  I love that it is USDA grade meat and no corn.  Corn can kill st bernards.  All this for just a couple bucks more than hills science.  Love the fact that I can feed both dogs same food on the all stages kind.",5
"Lucy's Cinnamon Thins are crispy, yummy and entirely too tempting! They taste like snickerdoodles,and I can't quit eating them!",5
"I ordered this because it sounded really strong, Jet Fuel.  And I like my coffee strong.  If you need the get up and go of a jet, then this is for you.  It's even too strong for me.  I can see people enjoying it though, because even with all it's potency, it isn't bitter.",3
I tried this on a whim because they had a coupon at the store when they first came out.  They are the best.... unfortunately you want to keep eating them.  They are the perfect snack in between breakfast & lunch.  Perfect to eat at your desk and still keep working.  I hope they come out with more flavors.  I have been having problems finding them in the stores on a regular basis so I ordered them here.  Very convenient.,4
I was sent the wrong item twince. I still do not have the item I ordered.,1
"I am a big fan of Kind Bars.  However the Kind Plus, Almond Walnut Macadamia + Protein bars left a biting aftertaste as though they were rancid.  I tried two bars with the same result.  Will not order the bars again<br />On the bright side, the Almond & Coconut are delicious.  Will definitely order them again -often.",1
"I am compelled to warn you coffee lovers out there.  I read the reviews of so-called coffee aficianados regarding this particular brand.  I believed that organic coffee has to be better than the others I've tried just because of how its grown.  Not so, buyer beware.  This is the absolute worse coffee I have ever had the displeasure of polluting my palate.  I now believe that the first reviewer must have some personal stake in this brand, or some of your taste buds have been dulled.  I tried to return this product [[ASIN:B000GAO9WO Caffe Appassionato Organic Shade Grown Espresso Roast, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)to Amazon, but was told that food items are non-refundable. My spouse and I tried to drink this coffee and after having 3 bags of this sludge in our cabinets, we finally decided to throw it away.  I thought of re-gifting to friends, but I like and want to keep my friends.  The only thing this coffee can possibly compliment is the garbage.  It's just so wrong that it sucks so bad.",1
"This is legitimate cassis, just like in France.  It is definitely worth buying, except for the price.  The price Amazon is selling this for is a bit high.",4
Very fast delivery time.<br />Tast was bland but nice color & consistency.  Lots of mousse for the price.  Would buy it again if having a party.,3
"Tried the gluten-free mix in apple muffins sweetened with applesauce and agave nectar.  Awful. Had to throw them out, but I figured it might have been the baking powder that lent this strange, bitter/sour aftertaste.  Then I tried it to make a roux for a chicken-broth-based cream sauce - and I had to throw that out too.  The aftertaste is highly unpleasant and I don't see how anyone gets past it.  I'm very happy with Bob's Gluten-Free Pancake Mix, so this was a surprise.",1
"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>I am more of an espresso/americano guy, but every now and then I really love a good cappuccino. This beverage tastes like the ""Cappuccino"" you would get out of a gas station machine or a vending machine. The milk has a slightly weird taste and it is sweetened! Why not let customers add sugar to taste rather than over sweeten the product? The drink is not strong or bold and as a little on the watery side when made according to the included instructions. It leaves you feeling really full and heavy not like a true cappuccino you would find in a local coffee shop. If you really want a cappuccino and have one of these machines, I think you'd be a lot better pulling an <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FHZA"">Espresso</a> shot and adding your own fresh milk (yes, that does mean you'll need to froth it!).<br /><br />Note regarding video: the reason the saucer is cracked is due to bad product packaging for the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA21Q0"">Nescafe Dolce Gusto Machine</a>. This is how it arrived to me.",2
"I just purchased this in a store, thinking it was still Organic Zero, and it's no longer organic, nor does it say from what it's made on the package.  Used to be just made from sugar cane...could be made from corn, like other Erythritol products are...does say it's Non-GMO, but all bets are off IMO, since we don't know what is used to make it anymore.  I will be returning the one I have...very disappointed!",2
I had my doubts about this but I bought it anyway and now I must say it's pretty tasty.  I add some splenda and it's quite good.  I have only used it for iced tea but I also wonder how it would do in a hot toddy this winter...,3
I have been waiting for non-caffeinated tea sampler for my Keureg.  I love this one.  The other tea sampler they have has green and black teas as well as a few herbals.  I drink more herbals than the others.  I now get green tea and this one and I am all set.,5
"My 9 month old has been happily eating fruit and whole grain combo as well as veggie and meat foods from Earth's Best.  These ""gourmet"" flavors sounded fun but she spat out and flatly refused to eat any of the four flavors in this multi pack.  I tasted them myself and they were pretty gross.  Somewhat annoying since I now have the remainder of this multipack sitting around.  That'll teach me to buy a whole pack untested!",2
"I was very disappointed to receive what I thought would<br />be a quality olive oil in a glass bottle, instead it is in a Plastic<br />bottle. I urge buyers not to buy this product as plastic<br />introduces cancer causing chemicals into the oil, specifically<br />if exposed to heat.  Additionally, plastic is ruining the<br />environment as it never breaks down, and is essentially<br />a permanent stain on mankind for unnecessarily<br />ruining the environment.  Please do not buy this product.",1
"YUMMM! We found another yummy flavor from Happy Family Brands!  So my daughter whose three eats these like they are a smoothie and with them being so easy to put in your bag or her backpack, it's such a reassurance that she's enjoying a healthy snack even away from home and at school.  Withh their easy twist top, even if she doesn't finish the whole thing, it is a nice feature you can put the cap back on for later; though it is so rare that she doesn't finish it all up.<br /><br />This may be one of her new favorite flavors, she really likes seeing what is in her pouch each time and asks for this flavor a lot.  I think the size is great for a toddler, so glad they combine fruit AND a veggie; plus being organic, I'm a happy mom :)",5
I ordered the Mulling spices as pictured.  What I received was the Spiced Cider mix as described.  I paid extra to have a case of it sent overnight mail.  I am very disappointed.  Apparently the ad department got the wrong ad with the picture and what I saw was not what I got.  I'm sending it back but who knows if I will get a refund and I'm probably definitely out the $22 overnight fee which seems wrong since it's their fault. BE AWARE!,1
"This large (16oz) two-serving can is big enough to share, and has some ingredients not found in my usual energy drink (Redbull) such as L-Carnitine.  But I found the flavor lackluster, the calorie count high, and somehow I didn't get the bit of a buzz that I normally get from an equivalent amount of Redbull.<br /><br />I've had Redbull in many conditions and combinations and always enjoy it (and always notice a bit of a perk, if not an outright buzz).  There wasn't any similar effect that I noticed from drinking a serving of this NoFear on an empty stomach.  Redbull hardly tastes natural, but this stuff tastes...weird, like flat RC Cola mixed with something.<br /><br />Comparing labels, the NoFear claims slightly higher caffeine content (87g vs 80g) than an 8.4oz Redbull, but also has more calories/carbs.  For a class of product that's already heavy on sugar, adding even more doesn't seem wise.<br /><br />It comes down to that I didn't think ""that was tasty!"", nor did I feel energized. Flavor preferences are personal, and I'm sure some people will get a caffeine jolt from NoFear, but for my tastes, Not Recommended.",2
The chips were fresh and shipped safely all the way to Afghanistan and quickly. I would definately order these chips again when I finish the others.,5
"It's an ok preserve. No strong negative comments about it, but I've definitely tasted better eggplant preserves in the Balkans. Though in the US these things are rare, and perhaps it's one of the best options out there.",4
"Having read the other reviews, I wonder if mine had just gone bad.  It has almost a fermented alcohol-like smell.<br /><br />My husband got the cashew bar, I got the banana cookie.<br /><br />Both were were so nasty we threw them away without eating them.",1
There's no other on the market as good as this.  I've ordered it many times.  My family wouldn't settle for anything less. Simply the Best.,5
I think this is pretty good.  Something different than regular coffee.  I think it has a very good taste.  I drink it when I want something different than tea or hot chocolate.,4
"This has the most agreeable crunch for when you just NEED something crunchy.<br />The package says it is 2 servings, and that is a satisfying amount if you chew to enjoy eat nugget.<br />The flavor is a subtle, the sesame seed comes through the most with the toasted grain flavor coming in next.<br />I liked this and would consider it a nice snack to have in my bag for a go to munch while out and about.  It is also something I would offer to my grandchildren as a change from sweets.",4
"These are nice spring roll wrappers, easy to use.  Next time I think I'll try a larger size but probably the same brand. Good product.",4
"I had high hopes for these because I LOVE the Jim Beam Jalape&ntilde;o Sunflower Seeds, but the Barbeque  seeds are not even close to being as good...they just taste rather funky...and stink...",1
"Flavorful and a great substitute for Honey Nut Cheerios.  Texture a bit airy.  My children love it, too.",4
"Trident Vitality is more or less an overpriced breath mint with ginseng panacea. Some buyers no doubt are looking for an energy boost while others hope for increased nitric oxide output (improvements in erectile dysfunction). I just wanted to rid my mouth of a club sandwich stink (it worked). This is not a popping, snapping, long-time chewing gum but it will revive your breath.<br /><br />Taste: The peppermint is strong enough to mask what I ate for lunch without searing my taste buds. The ginseng itself is not perceptible beneath the ""peppy peppermint.""<br /><br />Texture: The light candy coating melts away to a soft chew with ginseng grit. As the crunching effect disappears the consistency becomes sinewy -- about 3-to-4 minutes -- and less enjoyable to chew. By this time, my breath is minty and I dispose of the gum.<br /><br />Packaging: If a gum company ever needed to submit itself to Amazon's Frustration-Free Packaging Trident would be the one. Most pellet packs slide into a cardboard sleeve. Trident instead chose to engineer an entire box to house nine pieces of gum. Overkill? Yes. User-friendly? No.<br /><br />Rating: Three stars.<br /><br />BTW: The American Dental Association finds that the physical action of chewing these gums for 20 minutes after eating stimulates saliva flow, which helps to prevent cavities by reducing plaque acids and strengthening teeth.",3
"I love the way this is packaged (other than, as others have noted, you need to keep the K-cups in a resealable bag, so they're not quite as convenient as traditional K-cups in terms of storage).  But the coffee is only so-so.  Had several others try it, and they were not impressed, either--they liked the packages but didn't like the coffee.",2
My husband and I love these... (in regards to the previous reviewer... you shouldn't be eatting chewy candy with braces on),5
"I foster dogs for an animal rescue, and because I don't have dogs of my own yet, I tend to take the dogs that don't get along with other animals.  They are wonderful when they're at home with me, but taking them to the adoption events to try and get them adopted is another story...  Some of the dogs HATE being at the adoption events, where there are anywhere form 30-50 other dogs looking for their forever home.  So, I've handled quite a few medium-large dogs that lunge, growl, bark at any dog that comes near us while where there.  It's not very fun!  This is where these calming chews come in handy!  I double (and sometimes triple) the doseage for the 3 hours that I'm at the adoption event.  It's helped a little....can't say that it solves the problem completely, but I do notice a difference in my foster dog's anxiety level!",4
i've been drinking this for about 3 weeks...and i'm sorry...i just don't like it. it's not bitter...but it's just...not good. ?,2
"After doing numerous googles looking for Chipsters, one of my favorite childhood snacks, some reported that this product was very close to them. I disagree. About the closest flavor to the Chipsters so far would be Munchos, but still not the same. If you are conscious of diet, these will probably due.",2
"Ordering from Amazon.com was easy, fast, and reliable. Fast delivery and a very good product, it was packaged perfect. The bottle size for serving was also perfect, good size for keeping it handy and a delicious product. Very pleased will be ordering again. Thank you. The Foodworks",5
"I don't have terribly picky eaters, especially when it comes to treats, but I wasn't sure they would like the Fruitables.  I got them the Pumpkin Banana & they love them...I will probably get them the other flavors to try.",5
"I'm a bubble tea addict and have been trying to perfect an at home recipe for a while now.<br /><br />These pearls aren't quite as good as the Bubble Tea Houses, but they are a good at home substitute.  Even though they're marked as a ""minute pearls"", I've found that it's best to let them soak for at least an extra 30-50 minutes.  The taste and consistency is better that way.<br /><br />Just don't let them soak for too long, they'll end up expanding too much and won't fit through a bubble tea straw.",4
This is a pretty good all around tea.  You can make this pretty strong very easily.  Nothing too special about.  I will probably go on to try other teas.,4
"This coffee was reviewed by real coffee critics as one of the three best tasting.  I agree that it is the smoothest coffee I ever drank.  However, I buy coffee to wake up and this did not wake me up.  I would recomend Boyd's coffee for those of you that really want a wake up coffee.",2
The product is exactly as described.  My son loves this oatmeal.  I usually order it because he eats breakfast everyday and the cups are so convenient.,4
"We had an Easters party and i purchase this product to fill my pinata , The kids was surprised and happy with the candy's .",5
"These are wonderful. I found them at my grocery then they disappeared from the shelf.<br />Thank goodness for Amazon, I found them again. Great if you are dieting or not.",5
"Mothers Circus cookies cannot be found in stores on the East coast.  I thought I would look on the internet and Amazon offered them at a great price.  Even better, I created a standing order which is now shipped on a monthly basis.  Mother's Circus cookies are addictive and the best tasting cookies on the market.  I might have to up my order quantity to keep them in the house all month.",5
"I bought a case of these because our city was threatened with high flooding last Summer, and I thought I'd make better preparations for my home just in case there may be a repeat situation next year. And, this was my first try at buying foods online as well.<br /><br />I wish I could leave a better review for this item since I really do like this brand of Vienna Sausage, but when my package arrived about an hour ago and I opened up the carton to inspect it for any dented cans, I came across the occasional can that had *DEAD DRIED MAGGOTS* laying on the top! I didn't see any obvious dented cans or compromised seals that could have attracted these critters and the cans didn't put out any ""off"" smell that could have indicated a bad can, so I'm baffled to how they got there.<br /><br />All I can say about ordering any food online is ""caveat emptor"". I'm certainly going to be a bit more paranoid about it in the future.",1
"This tea was different than I expected, but not due to any kind of misrepresentation. In the past I had purchased my Kukicha tea from Adagio Teas. Their Kukicha is not roasted, and the color of the tea is a mixture of green and blonde. Perhaps it's not a true Kukicha, but I really enjoyed it. The Davidson's tea has a dark brown roasted color and consists of fairly small twigs. I admit to being a bit disappointed initially since I have not enjoyed roasted teas in the past. Ugh, I thought, now I have a huge one pound bag to get through! Once I made the first cup, I was pleasantly surprised. The roasted flavor is (to me) more subdued than the dark color would suggest. Still prominent, but not overpowering. I've had at least 25 cups so far and I'm not at all tired of the flavor. I also appreciate that it is easy to clean up. Some teas cling to the brew basket as they dry, but these ""twigs"" drop right out. Given the price, I'm pretty satisfied.",4
This kimchi is tasty but is very expensive for what it is. ~15$ for packing and ~8$ for the kimchi itself makes this kimchi which is enough for 5 servings 23$ total.<br />However the packing is excellent(which consists of many boxes and icce packings) and the taste is excellent. But price is not compromised.,4
"Purchased locally, not on Amazon... but it is the same product.  Now that I see it on Amazon I will purchase here -- it is cheaper than at Target.<br /><br />I have been using this specific litter for about 16 months now and cannot rave enough about how great it is for odor absorbency. I grabbed this brand, really, just to try it... after a lifetime of being a cat owner I am compelled to try every cat litter I see on my quest for a fresh smelling home.  WOOHOO!  I hit the jackpot with this stuff!  My (wait, mine?) litter box is located in the basement laundry room of my Seattle home... plenty musty and damp.  So if any cat litter can handle cat urine AND that environment, it's got to be amazing.  Seriously, this stuff doesn't let any of that ammonia stench out into the air.  Ok, it does... but that's when the litter is overdue to be completely changed.  For reference, we empty the fecal solids as needed, and when we do, we mix together the non-urine saturated litter with the clean, blue litter.  And every 2 weeks we completely change the whole litter box.  I use a little more than half the bag at that time (MEANING... 2 BAGS SHOULD LAST A SINGLE CAT OWNER 4-6 WEEKS, depending on your specific cat and litter box location) Anyway, really - give this stuff a try and you will be hooked just  like I am.<br /><br />As for the other reviewer and the blue dust?  I really have no idea about that.  I don't have blue dust on my tables and washing machines (I just wiped mine down a few minutes after reading her review so I could see if I'd been breathing in blue dust).  I appear not to have that issue.",5
"These are actually for my dogs, easy way to get them to take daily meds and such. Great for training motivation too. And i guess good for emergency food as they hold for a few years.",4
"Followed directions to the letter. Quarter cup of milk was way too much for the amount of cheese powder. I used a measuring cup, stirred and stirred, waited thinking it might thicken with standing, poured it over the shells and got shells with cheese water. Not creamy. Couldn't see it or taste it on the shells. I opened a box of Kraft macaroni dinner, added some of the cheese sauce and ended up with Annie's Kraft Dinner.<br />  I'm hoping maybe my cheese pack wasn't full. I plan on NOT following directions next time. I'll measure a quarter cup of milk and add it to the cheese powder a bit at a time until I get what I need, instead of adding the cheese sauce to a quarter cup of milk in the measuring cup.",1
"Tried the first one and wish I didn't have the rest of the 36 bars to eat through. Grainy paste texture and a very bitter aftertaste. It was my first time to try halvah. Sorry, but I recommend that maybe Amazon think about food samplers for people to try new products without the large outlay of money.",1
"These bars are very crunchy so you won't feel cheated in the chewing department.  They do crumble a lot so you will make a big mess eating them, it's unavoidable.  the only complaint is they can't keep them together.  They begin crumbling before you even touch the package.  They taste good for Granola and if it not for the mess I would prefer them over other bars.",4
"Bought this at Ralphs, 1 for $4.49 to try and was unimpressed. The high protein is great, but you can find that in other grocery store products. The high fiber is great for diets, and you can't find this high in any other pasta, but it tastes and is the texture like macaroni for kids. It definitely tastes and feels better than some ""healthy"" pastas available, but I'm just not sold on this. If you want low net carbs and that's your main goal, definitely use this and add in meats, veggies, and cheese to your dish for a good meal.",3
"The containers were damaged and the powder was spilled out of the containers into the bags and the box. We managed to pour back the powder from the bag but threw away what was in the box. I am really disappointed with this product. I should have bought that from store.<br />Besides, I don't know why the containers are only full up to two/third of their capacity.<br />Anyway, go and buy from store unless you want deformed half full containers.",2
"If you like jasmine tea, This is a great tea! Its lite not, overly medicine tasting like jasmine tea can be. Its also fun to watch the tea leaves unfurl... I steep it so many times that until I lost count.. haha. Just Great .",5
I found these in a local grocery story and wanted to try them before buying a larger quantity here. They were extremely dry so I checked the 'best by' date which was 5 months out so I don't think they were stale. But I needed liquid just to wash this bar down.,1
Too sweet. And something slightly off about it. But it's good if you need to grab something quick (and you've exhausted your supply of Lara bars),3
"The better the coffee, the higher the price. So, even tho they say this coffee is grown in high areas of the world, dont bet it contains coffee beans from the hawaian volcanos, Jamaican mountains, or the Ethiopian highlands, even tho the coffee bag says the ""High Grown Beans"" are harvested from the ""Finest coffee producing regions around the world"" . Its 100% arabian coffee, like a lot of the coffee at the grocery store. It's got a great vanilla scent and aftertaste, but then again, its naturally and artificially flavored. So if you are a conneseseur of the finest coffees, and finest flavorings, you'll probibly pick up on this divergence between what the bag claims, and what the Amazon discription claims. However, if your palette is not so discerning, you'll not spot the difference. From my standpoint, MELITTA's PARISIAN VANILLA produced a good, solid cup of ""desert coffee"". It's smooth enough, but you'll probibly want to add sweetener and some cream or milk, to bring out the vanilla flavoring.  It did drink well, to the bottom of the cup, without becoming bitter. (Milk tends to keep Cafe au Lait from becoming too bitter, tho.) It smells wonderful, by the way.",4
"It's not the best tasting coffee I've ever had, but it's a good compromise if you suffer from GERD and refuse to give up coffee.",3
"Good products<br />Love Diet Energy 5/5 and Diet Root Beer 5/5<br /><br />a couple stinkers -<br />Diet Fountain Mist (Mountain Dew-like, tart fake flavor) 1/5<br />Diet Dr. Pete (Weak flavor, not bold like Dr. Pepper) 3/5<br /><br />Amazon - Do better on price! This is 5.99 to 6.99 in the stores (you are charging double)<br />Sodastream - Reformulate these two!",3
"I've been buying this brand of vinegar for probably 20 years now. Used to buy it at a local health food store, now I usually shop online. I use it on my salads. First I use olive oil then the vinegar. My family loves my salads. Wonderful product.. No complaints.",5
"These are absolutely terrible! I remember Lemon Coolers. These are a complete joke. They taste like fat. OK, grease. Whatever.  Absolutely no zing, no lemon flavor at all. Kroger has just come out with a lemon cookie - can find them in the same area as Vanilla Wafers, as that's pretty much what they look like.  They are a lot more lemony and flavorful in general, and my resourceful fiancee took a few and spritzed them with water, rolled them in confectioner's sugar, and they were a LOT closer to the original Lemon Coolers than these ridiculous discs of disappointment.",1
Great tasting coffee. I use this in a plunger and it makes nice strong tasting coffee similar to an espresso machine. I would def purchase this again.,5
I love this mix!  I will start buying it from Amazon because it's cheaper than at local stores.  I noticed that some reviewers found that this mix was no longer on shelves at their local stores.  Here it is always stocked.  I have been keeping track of how many Starbucks Tall size Chai Lattes with soy milk I get from one 9 0z. can.  I generally get twenty.  I'm wriggling with delight at how many I will get from a two pound bag.,5
"The jar was less than 1/3 full. For this price, one would expect an entire jar...full to the top.  The product coated the inside of the jar so it wasn't until i opened it to find it is mostly empty. It tastes fine, but what am i going to do with 1/4 cup of pistachio nut cream?",2
Tastes like the real thing but without any alcohol.  Very good candy and any Greeks on your Christmas list will really enjoy the authentic taste of Greece I am sure.,3
"I saw these at a local health food shop and decided to give it a try since I wanted a dairy free chocolate bar.  You certainly get the dark chocolate - very strong and bitter. I knew coconut was in there from the label, and from the shreds of it I could see in the bar but I really did not taste any coconut - the chocolate flavor overpowered it completely.  The label says it contains almonds, but you don't taste that either.  I was hoping for more of a harmonious blend of both chocolate and coconut.  It certainly isn't sweet either.",2
"While I cannot speak to all critters - the groundhogs are not at all impressed and ignore this entirely  and the squirrels at my house will walk through thick applications - even piles of this stuff with no discouraging effects at all.  A total waste of time, and effort",1
"This is a creamy textured soup with a little bite. It does contain chicken broth, for those who are vegans to be aware of.<br />It's a quick healthy snack, and I find I turn to it again and again.<br />I buy it on Amazon as its no longer available at the stores I shop in. Its been a favorite for the past two years.<br />It has a wonderful, interesting flavor, has a reasonable caloric content (1 C= 140 cal.) and needs nothing to make it more so, like many other soups which lack interest.<br />I'm about to purchase my second case.",5
"Let's see, peppercorns at a good price...yep, that's what it is. ;)<br /><br />Product is as described and a good value.",4
"I bought these minerals at Erewhon Natural Food Store in Los Angeles about 6 months ago and continue to buy them regularly.  Since I started taking these supplements I haven't gotten sick, they definetly strengthen your immune system.  I can feel the difference!",5
I am not a big fan of decaffeinated coffee--I figure what's the point?  Taste is so often compromised.  I have recently found that caffeine bothers me if I drink it after 7pm so it's decaff or nothing at that point.  Riviera Sunrise tastes like regular coffee.  I was so impressed I decided to try it as my morning coffee.  I expected to have a very negative response to not getting the morning caffeine of my usual coffee but that did not happen.  If you must give up caffeine this is a great solution.,4
"I'd never tried this rice before, despite seeing it around forever and hearing good things about it. Finally picked up a bag when we ran out of our Lundberg Akitakomachi rice (good stuff -- try it), and was pleasantly surprised. I did rinse it several times until the water ran clear, and brought the cooking water up to just about my first finger joint. Brought it to a boil, then covered and let simmer for 15 minutes, then shut the heat and let it steam for about 20 minutes more.<br /><br />It has a very pleasant gloss and stickiness, along with a subtle, clean flavor. It's perfect for sushi, but I'll also use it alongside other Asian meals, since it's very chopstick-friendly. Our staple is usually Golden Phoenix Thai Jasmine, which is exceptional -- if you're lucky enough to find it, don't miss it; but I'll definitely start adding this rice into the rotation. The texture is quite delightful and a nice change of pace. If you enjoy moist, stickier rices for general eating as well as sushi, you'll find a lot of ways to use Kokuho Rose. But shop around, as the listed price is quite high for the amount of rice.<br /><br />I also picked up a bag of the same producer's sweet/glutinous rice, specifically to use for homemade rice wine. I was surprised to find it too bland for eating, but it worked just fine for the wine.",5
"What a nice product to dispense medication for pets. Some pets don't take kindly to fingers jammed down their throats. The pill holder ,akes it easy!",5

"I recently gave up coffee and decided to try three different coffee substitutes: Roastaroma, Cafix, and Pero. Although Cafix tasted the most like real coffee (and it tastes *a lot* like real coffee), and all three products are pretty good, Roastaroma was my favorite.<br /><br />It is very similar to coffee, but it doesn't quite have the bitter bite of coffee. Those of you who are looking for that slight bitterness might prefer Cafix. Roastaroma actually reminds me a little bit of Mexican hot chocolate--the cinnamon and carob flavors come through pretty strongly in the drink, giving it a cinnamon-chocolatey flavor. I used to drink coffee to satisfy my sweet tooth on low calories. This drink totally fits the bill for this purpose.<br /><br />The Pero is pretty good, too. Like Roastaroma, it doesn't have the bitter coffee taste, but it still makes for a decent imitation of decaf. I like to drink it with cinnamon-flavored powdered creamer. Pero's a good value, too: it's strong enough that you don't need to use very much to flavor your whole drink. I drink the Pero when I'm trying to ration the Roastaroma out to myself so as not to run out.<br /><br />So Roastaroma has the best flavor, Cafix tastes the most like coffee, and Pero is a good back-up.<br /><br />A quick note on Postum: I do not care for it. I find that people who like Postum tend to be people who were never coffee drinkers. It tastes nothing like coffee. If you try Postum as a coffee substitute, you will be disappointed.",4
"This one seems to be flavored more to a cat's liking than the rest of the Florentine varieties.  They're expensive, so buy one of each to see what floats with your cat but here, one will eat this and the other one won't.  It is gobbled up quite quickly too, I might add, by one of them so there you go!  Anyway, the greens addition is great for cats, they seem to like it in their other varieties, and they're high on the nutrition scale. So, if you're looking for higher protein and better nutrition all around, be sure to give these a go.  In our house, the pates have fared the best over the shreds and particularly, these florentines.  The egg soufles seem to be the favorites here - they ""hoover"" them down so fast they barely come up for air!  Recommend!",4
I love chocolate cereal and I love Cap'N'Crunch so I was excited to try this. Gag me. It's awful. I don't know who taste tested this before it came out but they apparently arent familiar with the taste of chocolate. I dont know what this taste is?! I would like to give no stars.,1
"My husband creates delicious soups using this broth along with onions, carrots, celery, and cabbage and either shrimps or fish filets.  It's basic and easy to use frozen filets such as tilapia.  The stock has lots of flavor so not much more is needed.  However, he likes it spicy so we add sriracha and a bit of Thai fish sauce.  The stock is convenient, tasty, and easy to store. It's hard to find at the grocery stores, so we buy our supply from Amazon.",5
It really works. Better than caffeine for a late afternoon brain pick-up or even a morning wakeup call. Brings focus and clarity without the jitters. I've tried capsules but liquid form like tea is more easily assimilated. Yogi Tea brand always manages medicinal teas that taste good too.,5
I have been making this for a number of years. I love because it tastes like something and not wall paper paste  AND  it sticks with you. You are not hungry later in the morning after a nice bowl of steel cut oats.<br />  I learned how to make this in my Rice COOKER and I have great oats nearly every day. Love them,5
My dog has a sensitive stomach so this product helps to control the acid level in his stomach when he is eating his meals.,5

"These coffee pods ae from Fair Trade farms that are committed to sustainability.  The box is attractive and each of the pods is sealed in its own little packet.  I used them in a Senseo pod coffee maker as well as in the generic Mr. Coffee.  The coffee brewed up nicely and was a pretty dark color.  Unfortunately, the coffee itself was insipid.  It had weak flavor for a medium roast despite the deceptive darkness.  It was not the worst coffe I've ever had kbut not the best.  In fact it was not memorable at all, on a par with the complimentary packets you get in hotel rooms.  There is alot to like about this company but this brew left me cold.",3
Alvita  Nettle tea is lousy. It does not taste good. The tea bags have very little tea in them. Some of the tea bags were open and the contents spilled into the outer packaging. I will stick with another brand of Nettle tea. First they sent Parsley tea and I had to send that back. Don't waste your time or your money on this product.,1
"Has soy grits and flax in it, not what you expect in chips, and not adequately labeled as such when purchasing. Not the usual corn taste, although it has some health benefits. It's just not what I expected/wanted, and won't buy again.",1
"I ordered this product when it was on sale a while back, and got the 6 pack of boxes. After brewing a few tea bags, I thought the Red Goji/Raspberry flavor was indeed there, but the low amount of tea in each tea bag, didn't deliver almost any kind of caffeine lift. Each tea bag has very little tea in it. I called Lipton to complain, and the nice lady on the other end, pointed out that each tea bag has 1.2 grams of tea in it. (My box actually says 1.3g)  Hmm, I thought, how much tea by weight does an average tea bag of green tea have? My unflavored Meijer green tea bags have 2.2 grams of tea! The other two flavors of Lipton tea I bought also have a lot more tea in them when compared to the Red Goji/ Raspberry Lipton Tea. The Lipton Lemon Ginseng tea has 1.7 grams of tea, and the Orange passion fruit & Jasmine has 2.0 grams of tea! Why on earth has Lipton shortchanged the amount of tea in the Red Goji Tea? Just add some more green tea Please Lipton! This product is a disappointment!",2
We use this tea in our office and it's very popular.  Makes a nice cup of tea.  Of course it'd be cheaper to use tea bags but this is so easy and it makes the tea the perfect strength which is nice.  If you don't feel like steeping your earl grey this is a nice choice.,4
"hazelnut being the household favorite favorite, I thought I'd give these k-cups a try. The flavor is smooth and delightful. I suggest trying this brand for your k-cup machine!",4
"I had these Biscotti on vacation and really enjoyed them.  So when I saw them on Amazon, I jumped at the chance to buy them again at a good price.  While the Biscotti were very tasty, they were somewhat stale and not as crunchy as I remember from vacation.  Also, I noticed the expiration date was two months away from when I purchased them.  I don't know what the expiration dates are on those in the local grocery store but I wondered if these were excess Biscotti and that is why they were inexpensive.",3
"1st case was awesome.  2nd case was full of damaged, leaking and some empty boxes.  We, discarded this 2nd case in fear of contamination.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Rick",3
Edible but a bit firm and other products have better taste and are healthier for you. I doubt 1 or 2 bars will reduce your cholesterol.,2
"I have been a Senseo coffee lover since 2004.  This has been the best cup of coffee I have found.  On my last trip to Europe I brought a suitcase full of Senseo Coffee Pods back with me.  They are much cheaper in Europe.<br /><br />The coffee in the pods is not the same as in the past.  It's no better than the cheap coffee in the can you get at any grocery store.  I like a full bodied dark cup of coffee, and that's what I used to get in the Senseo Dark Roast.  Now it tastes like dishwater.  I like brewing one cup at a time so I ordered the aftermarket filter insert so I can use ground coffee.  If it doesn't work as advirtised, I'll get a different coffee brewing system.<br /><br />I am so disappointed.  Why can't companies leave well enough alone.  If Sara Lee needed to make a bigger profit margin, raise the price, don't change the quality.",1

My 9 1/2 month old would mush this around in her mouth and not swallow it.  There isnt much she doesnt like but she sure doesnt like this stuff.  It looks like a weird mushy green stuff.  I am sure it is super healthy but she didnt like it at all.,2
"I have 3 larger dogs - labs and golden retrievers, and I wanted to try this out with them, but it turned out to be basically useless.  None of them can understand that they're not supposed to eat the bottle, and only 1 of my dogs will continue to lick it after he realizes he can't have it.  Another of my dogs got so frustrated with it that she refuses to even lick it if I bring the bottle out.<br /><br />It was an interesting idea, and exactly what it said it was, but, unfortunately, it was a failure at my house.  I can see where it might be useful for smaller dogs or puppies, but definitely not for my dogs.",2
Used these for my outdoor wedding. I put them in a nice white tray and used small black bows on about a third of them. They looked perfect! People used them for when me and my husband walked down the isle together after the ceremony. Much easier to use than rice with less clean up. Not mention they kept all the kids very entertained.,5
"Apparently the other reviewers think that anything containing the word veggie is healthy. These snacks have 130 calories per serving, Frito-Lay Funyuns have only 120 calories in the same size package (28g). Funyuns also have less sodium. Veggie straws might have 2% of the RDA of vitamin C but thats about as healthy as it gets. To put that in perspective, a medium tomato (an actual vegetable) has over 60% of the RDA of Vitamin C.<br /><br />This is an empty calorie snack that is no more healthy than anything else in the snack isle. It's made almost exclusively from processed potatoes and corn, the same as any other salty junk food.",3
I ordered this for my diabetic daughter.  I found some not so great reviews from people  so I only ordered one bottle.  My whole family loves this stuff!!!  I even like it and I am not a sno-cone fan.  It has an excellent flavor!  The syrup is light and doesnt overtake the ice.  I will order all of my syrups from Back to Basics sugar free collection from now on.  I highly reccoment this product!!!!,5
These are very very small and taste really bad. The color of the cakes are really nasty. they look old and stale !!!<br />They also arrived very late,1
"Up front this drink seems like it's not a bad alternative to drinking soda. It's got a real strong fruit taste to it, definitely not subtle like other flavored sparkling water drinks. It's pretty sweet, too. I liked it better than soda.<br /><br />The only thing that I'm concerned with is the 140 calories for a can that's only 8.3 ounces. A can of soda is 12 ounces and has about 150 calories, so you're really no better off drinking this stuff. The label is slightly misleading since it reads ""100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't."" I think there's a lot of people out there looking for something else to drink besides soda, since soda is so sugary and is the source of a lot of empty calories. That being said, this stuff definitely does not deliver on that front. It's filled with empty calories. Sure, there's no artificial flavor or color, which is good, but the bottom line is you will still pack on the pounds if you drink this stuff often enough. Due to this, I gave it 3 stars. It's a nice treat to have on occasion, but you certainly won't want to make this an everyday thing.",3
"This is a great product, and costs 1/3 the price that I was paying at GNC!  I have used 2 T./day on cereal or with yogurt, recommended as a way of counteracting thyroid-related hair loss.  I have observed a significant difference.",5
Like the flavors of all except the Yumberry Blackcurrant. I agree with the other reviewer regarding the need for a flavor list on the product listing. Also like that these are single serve wrapped in foil.,4
My dog loves the Lamb Ultramix but hates this formula! :( I will never purchase it again. I may even switch brands because the only food he kinda likes is the lamb. My other pup loves the Grain Free Ultramix formula so she will stay on that. I just may have to take this at a loss and get rid of the food.,2
Only two of the seven herbs grew.  I was not satisfied with this product.,1
"We love this product at our house.  I had been buying it from Sam's Warehouse, but they quit selling it.....so I started buying from Amazon.  This container is a nice size and easy for the kiddos to handle for themselves.  It also can be stored for quite a while so we can stock up on it and save!",5
"I really like the idea of these bags, but for us, they didn't work...before these we used regular trash bags, which we always purchased the ones with the cinch ties. With these, we have to leave a lot extra bag out of the trash can so we can have enough to tie shut, which means we go through these twice as fast. The quality seems fine for what they are, but we won't be purchasing them again, as they just cause too much frustration for us.",3
"How can you go wrong with a 100% fruit snack that is both crunchy and delicious? The three flavors are all great. Granny Smiths are a little tart (in a good way), Fujis are sweet, and Cinnamon are absolutely delicious. I give the 15g bags to my kids. Equal to one apple. What a perfect snack! I feel great giving it to them. I eat the 48g with lunch. Filling and low calorie. Hope it helps.",5
I have two dogs...one who will eat anything and one that is extremely picky.  The picky one wouldn't eat them and the other did so not sure what to say.,4
"I've heard this is a good food, but was shocked to see after chicken meal so many grains. I did not feed this to my dog. I'd rather pay more money for better quality food. All those fillers are unneeded. I expect such a highly regarded company to have better ingredients. I always look for by products but didn't think to even bother to check the next 4 ingredients. Highly disappointed.",2
I puchase regular soda because I am allergic to artificial sweeteners. Why is there artificial sweetener in a regular soda syrup?,1
"The juice was deliciously sweet and exotic tasting. Sort of a cross between passionfruit and coconut. All of the containers were within the sale date marked on the cartons, with plenty of time for me to consume. Great stuff!",4
"I was impressed by the claims that this is an organic product and looked forward to using it in our organic vegetable and flower garden. We were disappointed when we read the fine print on the container that it could not be used on ""food or feed crops"" or ""ornamental, soft bodied plants.""  I think that point could have been made more clear in the advertisements.  Let the buyer beware!",2
"I LOVE Nestle Rich Hot Cocoa and I was so excited to find it on Amazon for a reasonable price, but I was really disappointed with the condition of the cans once I got the box they came in opened. Two of the six cans I ordered were crushed on top and one can had a massive gash in it which caused some product to spill out during shipping. This was really disappointing as chocolate isn't cheap. I was also incredibly nervous about using the product not knowing if the gash was man-made or if it was the result of improper handling from the warehouse? Consumers cannot be too careful these days with past cases of product tampering. Overall, I was satisfied with the length of time it took for me to receive the product. I just wish the presentation would have been better. Canned foods should NEVER have holes or gashes in them and crushed cans are usually caused from poor packaging.",3
"I was very disappointed when this ficus arrived.  Many leaves had dropped off but the worst part was that there were so many leaves which were blackened with some sort of insect infestation in the plant.  Rather than going through the trouble of repackaging it and delivering it to be sent back... I placed it in new soil, spread powered insecticide in it and put it in a larger pot and will hope for the best.  I was very surprised that this plant was delivered in this condition.  I ordered this because of the many positive reviews even though there were some also complaining about the problem I mentioned.",2
"We used to buy this product at Costco, but they discontinued it...with a little hunting we found it carried by Amazon.  YAHOO!  Love the cocoa.",5
"I tried this formula after switching from Similac.  My son was first started on Similac Advance at the hospital, and tolerated it well until week 2 when he became so constipated we had to give him a suppository per his pediatrician.  We tried Enfamil Gentlease, and he seemed to hate it right from the start, then after remembering my cousin rave about this formula with her daughter, we tried the Good start.  I wish I had started him off with this from the beginning.  He immediately drank it down, unlike the Gentlease which he wouldn't even take more then a few sucks of.  He tolerated it so well, and the constipation was gone.  He was still gassy a bit, as all babies seem to be, but nothing excessive like before.  For a few weeks he was still a bit fussy when having a bowel movement, but again, it was such a drastic improvement from where we had been prior.  As time went by his stools became easier to pass, and now there is no fussing at all.  The preparation is easy.  You simply add the powder to water and shake.  There had been different directions on some older cans with boiling water then adding the powder, but that has since been replaced with the simple, add powder to water and shke version.  THere are far fewer bubbles after shaking then the other formula's I have tried (Similac, Enfamil) and the clumping is minimal.  Simply take a spoon etc.. to break up clumps.  The smell is tolerable too, and is much better then the other formula's I have smelled.  The price is good as well.  Babies r us seems to have the cheapest price at around $20 a can, but other stores like Kmart, Target etc... seem to come in around $23 a can and drug stores (not recommended) come in highest at $25-26 a can.  I have actually found grocery stores to be cheaper then independent drug stores for the formula, but by the far babies r us has the cheapest price.",5
"I switched to this food in an effort to stop the daily vomiting with my six cats. They ate it for about a year with no problem. The vomiting decreased to almost nothing and most of the cats seemed healthy eating it, except one which started getting a bald spot on her back.<br /><br />Then, about a month ago, they stopped eating it. The same food sat for a week, so I dumped it and opened a new bag, thinking something had happened to that bag. Same results. I also realized that it had a smell I never noticed before, kind of musty or moldy, very unappetizing and it tainted some items I had in the pantry where the unopened bags were stored.<br /><br />I don't know if they changed the formula or if I got three contaminated bags, but I'm out $60+ because of it.",2
"We have four cats, and two of them could care less about these treats but the other two go nuts for them.  That's about par for the course, because as we know there are few things cats find unanimously palatable.  Our oldest is thin and unwell these days and these treats are the only thing he is enthusiastic about eating.  I have gotten him to  eat some wet food by placing these on top.  Worth a try if your cat feels the same way about them. Haven't tried the other flavors yet.",4
Excellent choice for those that enjoy a strong cup of coffee.  You can make a larger cup and still have rich flavor.,5
"I have been subscribing to this and other Kind products for over a year now, and have noticed that the bars are getting smaller and smaller, but the price keeps creeping up.<br /><br />It have become almost a game when the bars arrive: How much smaller are the bars going to be since the previous consignment of 3 months ago?  Maybe I should keep one from each shipment and compare its length when the next arrives.<br /><br />Of course the wrapper remains the same size, and that just adds to the fun.  I wonder if the bar will ever reduce to half the wrapper size.<br /><br />Apart from all this, the quality of the bars themselves has remained consistent, but the freshness varies from shipment to shipment.",2
"I love Twinings tea, so my brother surprised me the last time I visited him by buying a box. I had a hard time getting through it, as it just doesn't compare to Twinings tea in a tea bag. I like strong tea (with milk) and the K cups just don't have the same amount of flavor. I kept thinking, ""How hard is it to pour boiling water over a tea bag? Why do I need a K cup to make tea?"" I appreciated my brother's thoughtful gift, but can't recommend making ANY tea with a cup machine.",2
"This is the best strawberry milk, it's delicious and it's healthy, what more could you want?",5
"I once again read all the reviews about this coffee, the good, the bad, the ugly, and bought  the coffee any way. I keep in mind all of our taste buds are different, mine must be one of the good ones. I really liked this coffee, I liked everything about it.The coffee, was not too strong, bitter or acidic, it was smooth and mellow, with a good aftertaste.  Long after I finished drinking the coffee, I would affirm, I still tasted, french toast coffee, a good thing, the aftertaste was not bad.My thoughts are, this would make a nice iced coffee, or be served during a brunch, or as an after dinner coffee. If you want something stronger, then, this is not for you.I like it and I am sticking to my words on this one.",5
"This review isn't about the product, which is great.  It's about Amazon jacking up the price 33% in the last three weeks.  Here's a big F-U to the greed which is destroying this country. How can 3oz of freeze dried chicken cost $10?  From $6.50 to $10 is a joke.<br /><br />Thanks for a great product. Best way to keep loyal customers is to F*** them over.  Keep up the good work!",1
I started this seed kit in February. All three plants grew well but one of the Red Heirloom did not get any flowers. The other I was able to harvest around 6 tomatoes and the Golden variety around 10 tomatoes total. After that I didn't get any more flowers due to having to keep the plants trimmed so they weren't growing into the lights. I would probably not purchase this seed kit again. I love the herb kits and have had nothing but success with them. The tomatoes I found too pricey for the actual yield I got.,3
This is a fantastic idea and the ONLY solution for storage of K-cups without taking up valuable counter or drawer space. An excellent good quality product that works as advertised - thank you for creating it!! P.S. I used the 4 screws for added security and they installed without the use of a drill!,5
Loved this Seaweed!! Tasty! not like some seaweed that you get that is very bland.<br />Not too salty like some of the the seaweed you get from the Korean supermarkets.,5
"This review is ONLY IN REGARDS to the PHYSICAL CAN.  I will review the actual product once I have tried it.  But for now please be advised before you purchase------- I read the reviews - Lots of dented cans....  I figured there were so many complaints that it just couldn't still be happening, right?  WRONG!  6 of the 12 were badly dented all along the upper rim seams.  Amazon did, however, make good on my order with an exchange.  Still----- disappointing that the product quality control is so poor with this product after all the bad reviews.",2
These are excellent.  I love mixing it with cream cheese and putting it on wheat crackers.  This stuff is great.,5
"I have been making my own maple-flavored syrup for over 40 yrs and wanted to experience the ""real thing"" so I purchased this highly-rated syrup and gave it a try. Since my home-made syrup only costs a small fraction of the real thing, I was expecting a huge difference. Nope, the real maple syrup is good but I have to admit I like my home-made stuff just as much. Everyone has different tastes so there is no right or wrong. It's all subjective.",4
"I used to get these instore and found a cheaper deal on Amazon. I recently realize when you open the bag, there's a strong smell (like plastic or chemicals). I tried a little bit myself and the smell is just so strong that I can't bear it. I tossed everything everything away and would not buy this again.<br />It's made in China. You don't know what they put in the chicken strips to get them addicted or .... sick.<br />AVOID!",1
"I purchased these bones for my two bullmastiffs.  I thought they were like the other bones previously purchased, but these were brittle and splintered.  After paying the $880 vet bill for the bone fragments in my bullmastiff puppy's stomach, I threw them away.  I would not recommend them at all.  My male bullmastiff chewed threw 1 bone in about five minutes.  An expensive lesson.",1
These taste gross and I would not eat them. They are going in the trash!!! Dont waste your money. You are better off just eating something else. I was very disappointed that the reviews said they were tasty because they are anything but. My dog wont even eat them.,1
"I have been searching for some time for the honey mustard with this label.  Previously available at Grandy's restaurants, it is not the same.  This a lighter color almost dressing style honey mustard with a light taste of mustard.  Has not been stored in a hot place, but consistency has separated with several cups recently.",2
"...or the good reviewers' taste buds are weak.  This is some disappointingly<br />weak coffee.  I'm not some crazy ""gotta have my jet black sludge to get<br />through the day"" coffee drinker - I'd say my favorite (and my wife's) is<br />Caribou Blend.  This blend is WEAK, it can't hold half-and-half or even<br />just whole milk without being wiped out.  Now, I will say I brew it on<br />the ""large cup"" (9.25 oz, I believe) setting on our Keurig, so maybe it's<br />a bit better on the 8oz setting, or even the small setting.  But Caribou (we<br />also like Donut Shop, Green Mountain Kona Blend 10%, etc.) can be easily<br />brewed on 9.25 and hold a good bold taste.  This coffee doesn't<br />hold a CANDLE to any of those.  Now I'm stuck with 40+ of these. Blech...maybe<br />the guests won't mind it! :)",2
Looks like they didn't really taste test this product.  Nothing in the realm of dark chocolate springs to mind when drinking it.  We were disappointed.,2
"Beneful is an inexpensive dog food from Purina, one of the original and best- known names in pet food. This particular Purina product is a little different from most in that it contains different colors and shapes of kibbles along with vegetables for a supposedly better- balanced diet.<br /><br />Beneful is an easy to find dog food sold in most stores, including both pet foods and grocery stores/supermarkets. Its widely available status and low price make it an easily recognizable and popular  product and its re-sealable bag is very convenient. It keeps the food inside and undesirable things out, so that the dog food remains fresh and edible for a long time.<br /><br />Name recognition, popularity, low price, nice packaging- these are all good extras, but what about the dog food itself? Well, it seems to be hit and miss with this product. The level of protein isn't too bad and the level of fat is kept under control, but the ingredient list is cause for concern. The first four ingredients are ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and whole wheat flour. These are not the ingredients you want to see at the top of a list for your dog's primary source of nutrition. Dogs need meat- not meat by products but real, quality meat- and the best quality dog foods have meat listed first.<br /><br />Some of the other ingredients are equally questionable. The dried peas and carrots are fine, but look at all of those artificial colors. Yes, it does make the food look pretty when poured into a bowl, but this is more for human appeal- a dog really doesn't care about seeing varied hues in its food. A dog just wants something that tastes good while you, the owner, want something with quality and good nutrition.<br /><br />Speaking of the taste, Beneful does score points in this area and that might be a good part of the reason why so many dog owners buy this for their canine friends. Dogs really love this food, and my dog is no exception. He will finish off a large bowl without even pausing and he seems anxious for more.<br /><br />So, how do I rate Beneful dog food overall? Well, I find it has both good points and bad points. It worst quality is the ingredients, but then again, when I look at the ingredients of other dog foods in the same price range, what I see on the Beneful label isn't all that bad. Dogs love the taste, and the nutritional aspects are okay. Thus, when all factors are considered, Beneful rates average overall. It can't compare to the high- quality dog food brands sold in many pet stores, but it has enough good points to recommend it-- barely.",3
"Yes, dogs love these treats but educate yourself before you buy any dog treats made in china.<br /><br />Per ABC News;<br />Just six months after issuing its latest warning about chicken jerky dog treats made in China, the Food and Drug Administration confirms it has logged more than 900 complaints from pet owners who say their dogs either were sickened or died after eating the treats.<br /><br />The number of complaints has nearly doubled since the story was first reported by ABC News in March. The FDA says its investigation is ongoing and that it continues to test samples of the popular treats, which dog owners across the country say have caused kidney failure in their pets, resulting in severe illness or death.<br /><br />[...]",1

"If you can't eat wheat pasta, Tinkyada is the brand to buy.  The white rice pasta I bought at the store was mushy and didn't hold its shape.  It was a pale imitation of the ""real thing"" (i.e. wheat pasta)  But Tinkyada's pasta I can enjoy eating.  As long as you cook according to the directions, you can't tell it's not ""normal"" pasta. I usually add a bit of oil to the water with the pasta to discourage sticking, because I don't do a very good job remembering to stir it!  It's also brown rice-based, so it's healthier for you.  One warning, if you put plain pasta in the fridge, it will be hardened when you pull it out.  But, heat it with some sauce, or reheat it in a pan of water on the stove, and it's nice and soft again.  If you store it with sauce, then this problem is avoided.<br /><br />I've tried four shapes of Tinkyada pasta, and this is definitely my favorite.  The fusilli is like a hollow spaghetti, with a slight twist to it.  With the interesting shape of spiral/rotini pasta, but without the bulkiness.  It seems very fancy, but doesn't really cost a whole lot more.  This is the shape we use most often.  We use it with marinara sauce, meat sauce, chicken parmesan, chicken noodle soup, etc.  Very versatile.  Highly recommended to anyone who can't eat wheat/gluten.",5
This is a very good espresso blend at a bargain price.  It does well in a pump espresso machine and since it is a little on the mild side it will probably do well in a drip machine at higher temperature.  However it is a very popular brand so if you shop around you may find it in the small resealable metal cans for only pennies more at your local store.,4

Before this, we were having Jim's Together Decaf Organic Coffee and though Jim's is a little more expensive, if we have to use twice as much of this coffee to get enough flavor, couldn't save anything - even then, it still didn't have as much aroma.. Maybe because these are ground coffee and with Jim's, we buy the beans at a supermarket and grind them there - I don't know. But I don't think we will use other 2 bags of this coffee...",2
"I have purchased many nylabones and have had success with dogs that love to chew toys.<br /><br />I got a new dog who doesn't like chew toys but does like food, a lot. And at the same time, if he does chew something he could easily destroy it.  I thought that if I put peanut butter or something like that in this hollow part of the dura chew he'd enjoy working at getting the food and not destroy the nylabone in the process. In addition it has 'branches' for him to help hold the chew bone in place.<br /><br />It didn't work out the way I expected.  It's too heavy for him to want to carry around and he can't get his tongue very far in the hole so he gets frustrated. I'd almost say it's a little too indestructable. Once he gets the food that is accessable to him out he puts it aside.<br /><br />It's a good toy for dogs that like nylabones. The hollowed out part didn't work like I thought it would.",3
"Beetlejuice is a very Tim Burtonesque Tim Burton movie, establishing his fascination with the macabre and, especially in this case, the funny, campy side of death and horror.  It's the story of a newly dead couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) who are essentially stuck as ghosts in their house, and don't like its new owners (parents Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara and daughter Winona Ryder).  They enlist the help of a more experienced, half-crazy but very insistent ghost, Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), in an effort to scare the new owners away by haunting them.  Beetlejuice turns out to have his own agenda, and alliances shift as the story winds through learning to be dead, afterlife bureaucracy, wild chases through small spaces, Calypso dancing at dinner to Harry Belafonte's ""Banana Boat Song"" (""Day-O""), a very goth wedding ceremony, and supernatural comeuppance.<br /><br />The cast, for the most part, is perfectly suited to the wacky material, the sets and make-up and other effects very imaginative, the story engaging.  Great fun.<br /><br />This new release is being marketed as the 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition.  It will be newly remastered, but the extras announced so far are very limited: three episodes of the Saturday morning Beetlejuice cartoon series (""Skeletons in the Closet,"" ""Spooky Boo-tique,"" ""A-Ha!""), a music-only track, and the trailer.  The cartoons are about 11 minutes each.  Possibly more features will be announced later, but usually that doesn't happen.  I've subtracted one star for the poor features in a ""deluxe"" anniversary edition; if they announce more features I may up my rating.  The best thing is likely to be the remastering, which is needed, since the older DVD wasn't all the great.  Looking forward to that.",4
"If my dog were reviewing this, he'd give it 5 stars - but that's because he's not aware that nutritional imbalances are possible.  It's high quality - and he thinks it's delicious.<br /><br />I looked back at the page after ordering to see if I'd just missed a warning, but I don't think it's there. The page is not clear enough, in my opinion - that this is NOT a balanced diet. I didn't realize until it arrived and has a note on it that says ""Wellness 95% Canned Recipes are intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only.""<br /><br />I get that I should have been aware that something with so few ingredients is obviously not enough for long term feeding, but I do think the page should have a more clear note on it so that when people are ordering a few cases of food quickly it's clear that this one is really more a treat than a meal.<br /><br />It's good though, for what it aims to be: a canned chicken treat to serve in addition to your dog's normal diet.",3
"My dogs seem to find Likety Stik extremely tasty as demonstrated by their desire to keep licking it. On my part, however, there are some reservations.  I have the liver flavor and for one, it is one of the worst smelling doggie treats that I have.  Not too sure if people want to carry this around in their purse. The stick works like a rollerball, like some of the anitperspirants you see out on market.  When you first open, it does not roll very easily, but eventually it will get going after your dog licks it a few times.  The second major reservation that I have is that if it is being licked, then the part my dog just licked cleaned, saliva and all, goes back into the fluid reservoir which doesn't seem too clean to me. Some may argue that this shouldn't make any difference to my dog who loves licking his hooha and whose favorite appetizer is cat poop, but I cannot help to think that this may be a festering ground for bacteria.  This may be prevented by having certain chemicals present that inhibit this possibility, but then it loops back to my concern of feeding these to my dog.  Although novel, I don't really see a benefit of having this as a treat other than the caloric count.",2
"I don't normally drink strong coffee, so this variety was good for me. Good flavor, but not too strong or bitter. The only down side is that several k-cups (probably 6 or 7 out of the first 2/3 of the box) failed and left an excessive amount of grounds in the brewed coffee. If not for that, it would be 4 stars.<br /><br />At the price I paid ($27.75) it is a pretty good value as well.",3
"I've ordered this arrangement many times for a number of people including; mother, step-mother, Grandma, aunts, father, people recovering from operations.  They all say the same thing: it's beautiful and they brag about it to their friends!  Only issue is with the delivery time.",5
"I was so excited to see this product because, as another poster mentioned, I tend to eat way too much regular peanut butter! I spread some on half of a pita and some fruit preserves on the other half, and the taste was terrible. They did try to make it nutty, but it almost had a really salty taste to it. It probably wasn't the worst thing I've ever eaten, and I will try to make myself tolerate it, but it just isn't good.",2
"I didn't like the way they packed this: one huge plastic bag with almost 25 ponds of mocca. I had to place it in different containers, creating a mess. But, besides that, the flavor is yummy, great for my frapucinno-mocca caffe. I make sometimes with just milk and is another tasty drink.",4
"I chose this product because of the great reviews but is not as good as I tought, it's just OK.",3
"I was quite hopeful about this candy, as I love the flavour of violet and having an inexpensive bulk supply would be quite nice.<br /><br />Unfortunately, rather than using a natural violet flavour, this candy uses an artificial one.  This makes it take on a rather flat and overpowering floral note, without any of the more interesting characteristics of violet (real violet flavouring always had a spicy undertone that reminded me of celery seed.)<br /><br />Additionally, the artificial colouring gives it a bitter note on the back of the tongue.  The flavour of the violet candy put out by L'Anis de Flavigny is much superior (and also available from Amazon.)",2
"This wine kit made excellent tasting homemade wine, and without all the work. It is easy to throw the ingredients together, and the sticker labels that come with it are fun for your dad or whoever gets this kit to come up with names to label their fancy wines. My husband and i gave this as a christmas present to my dad and he loved it. he has been making homemade wine for many years and this was the easiest kit he's ever used and has experience in all difficulties. this came on time and we qualified for free shipping.",4
"For my sense of smell, this tea doesn't smell like peach and ginger.  It smells like something else that is very unappealing and distasteful.<br /><br />Besides this tea, I recently tried several other Bentley teas -- mango, blueberry, raspberry, etc. -- and I have to report that I also disliked them.  The Bentley teas seem to have very different smells compared to other teas, like Twinings, Tazo, Ahmad, etc.<br /><br />Although I've tried many teas that didn't impress me, the Bentley teas are the first that I have found that I completely dislike.  Given the mixture of very positive and very negative reviews for their teas, I'm guessing that it is a situation where people have strong reactions to the smell of their teas and either love them or hate them.<br /><br />For a comparison, I would recommend trying the Ahmad Peach & Passion Fruit tea, which I think is very tasty -- and very, very different compared to this Bentley tea.",1
"These almonds tasted awful.  I would have returned them or tried to get a replacement, but could not find that option.  They tasted like they were past the fresh date.  Maybe the squirrels will eat them.",1
Tried this coffee for the first time when I got it from a friend. Nope. Not going there again. I found it too bitter and it tastes like its namesake.,2
Cafe Molido Santo Domingo Coffee.  I bought 3 bags. 1 bag would have been enough. The coffee is too finely ground and very bland. I have been to Santo Domingo and purchased coffee there in the grocery store. That coffee was very rich and had a great flavor. What happened to this coffee in transition is anyone guess. I drink a lot of coffee. This coffee is no comparison to a good Columbian Blend.,2
"I don't think I've ever eaten anything drier than these cookie bars, ever in my life. They taste okay, but I just can't choke them down, even with coffee.",1
"After the box got here damaged with the pasta sticking out,the company offered to send it again at no charge...<br />Great customer service!!!",4
They should specify what kind of milk is being used- as goat and sheep milk cheeses tend to be much stronger in taste,3
"It is not terrible by any means, but it has basically no flavor. Definitely the worst boxed macaroni and cheese I've ever had. Do yourself a favor and make your own mac and cheese. It is not very time consuming and tastes so much better than anything you will ever buy in a box.",2
I was excited when I bought this because if it was anything like what the coffee tastes like from the keurig machines then it was going to be awesome.... I tried the peach/black tea and it was nasty to say the least.... there was almost no peach flavor and it was supposed to be sweetened... it isnt... I like to drink unsweetend tea but this was just nasty and extremely bitter with a chemical aftertaste.,2
My dog absolutely loves these bones. I prefer the large size as to the extra large. They keep my dog busy and do not make a mess on the carpet.,4
I chanced having these shipped because it was a great deal. They arrived in good enough shape for the price I purchased them for but would never have the product shipped at it's normal rate as some of the pop-tarts end up being crushed/crumbled from being bounced around in shipment. There is no way for Amazon to correct this either as the pop-tarts package just isn't packed tight enough to stop the product from banging against each other.,3
"The best pistachios, but be careful. You can easily eat too many of these since you don't have to crack the shells. I deffinately recommend these nuts to all you nut-lovers out there! I'm NUTS for them!!",5
These chips are so flavorful. They taste close to potato chips but they are 100 calories and about 3g fat. Much healthier. They have a great crunch and are nice and salty for when that's what you're looking for. My favorite is the BBQ a few of the others taste a little weird to me.,5
"My son is 6 and he has celiac.  He loves sweets, however when he took a bite of this wafers he was done with it.  He said that it just was not good.  I tasted it and had to agree with him.  The only thing I could taste was the extreme sweetness and the fat sticking to the roof of my mouth.",1
"Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time.  MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free.  Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.  Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label ""yeast extract"".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.<br /><br />The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.  Dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore.",1
"Six weeks ago I bought this for $19.99, now it is priced at $49.99. What is going on? This is just wrong.",1
"The main reason I wanted to get this tea set was for the box and not necessarily for the tea.  I have been looking for a nice tea box for my wife to match our cherry cabinets.  Surprisingly, it is a lot harder finding a nice quality box with a window.<br /><br />Again to reiterate, I have not tried the tea so I will not comment on that.  The box however is very poorly built.  The picture is a lot nicer than what we received.  There is no way I could give this to my wife as a gift.  The inside compartments were bent and it looks like someone from elementary school pasted the inside lining because the felt was crooked and did not even cover the entire inside of the box.  The stain outside was uneven, especially at the lip where you are suppose to open the box.<br /><br />I had originally bought this because I saw a 5 star rating for this product.  Even though ratings are subjective, this product is far from a 5 star rating.",2
"I tried this with great expectations only to almost gag when the first forkfull of angel hair spaghetti and this dried tomato sauce hit my mouth.  It was truly discusting!  I threw out all the remaining packages because I wasn't going to ruin any more noodles with this crap.  Goodness, just thinking about how it tasted makes me feel like heaving!  I can't even explain why it was so terrible but, to me, it was.  The other reviewer liked it but...it's up to you to try it and decide for yourself.  Good Luck!!",1

"I bought this Gerber 3rd Foods Lasagna with Meat Sauce in a 12 pack, so I was really hoping my son would like it.  He didn't.  He basically sucks the sauce off of the little pasta chunks and then spits them out.  He has had other jars of food with chunks in them, so I know it's not the pieces that bother him.  Overall, pretty disappointed in this jar, but maybe someone else's baby would like it more than mine did.",3
I sent this to my niece away at college and it was a big hit!<br />Who doesn't love Goldfish?,4
"Yes, they are good. However, they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff, which is initially satisfying then becomes ""too much"". And certainly isn't good for the waistline or general nutritional issues.<br /><br />AND the package can't be opened without a sharp implement. I couldn't pull it apart at the top as I am used to doing. I don't normally carry a knife or scissors and don't have rodent teeth. Well, I was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key. Even then, the bag was *wow* thick and tough.<br /><br />On the package it says these are ""Krinkle Cut"" chips. Turns out that means the corrugated kind, not what I wanted. I don't eat ripple/ridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth. So this information is important.<br /><br />These are good but so are other brands with which I don't have these problems.",3
"When one purchases a product that is called Newman's Organics, one would expect organic food.  Not just the vegetables, which are much less expensive to be organic than the meat or chicken.  I was very, very disappointed to find out that the chicken is not organic.  For a couple of dollars more, just buy real organic dog food. This dog food isn't exactly cheap, so you expect that they will provide what they are advertising.  This whole ""greenwashing"" thing needs to be regulated better.  If someone uses the word organic in their description, it better be organic.  Otherwise the consumer is being deceived which is unfortunate.  Newmans has a great reputation, I buy a lot of their products, but this was intentionally deceptive and it makes me reconsider buying anything from them in the future.<br /><br />On the positive side, my dog loved it, she would lick the bowl around the room for 20 minutes after the last morsel was consumed.  I have no idea what they put in it that tasted so good, it's like the crack cocaine of dog food.  She has never been a finicky eater, she'll pretty much eat anything voraciously, but this stuff really rocked her epicurean world.  Too bad she isn't getting any more of it.",2
"The problem I have is how slow the shipping was on this product.  Even though it states that it ships in 2 to 3 days, it's more like 2 to 3 WEEKS.<br />other than that, the prices are good, and so is the coffee!",4
Very Disappointed!!!! I order these candy bars twice a year for my adult children. This is the second time I have received expired or about to expire merchandise:(,1
"I've been drinking Amazing Grass' Chocolate version for months and just ADORE it.  I decided to try the Mango Amazing Meal and was very turned off by the texture and flavor.  I'm sure the texture issue has to do with the dried mango.  I tried it with both almond milk and coconut milk, adding 1/2 frozen banana.  It turned out way too sweet as I didn't realize it already has sweetener in it.  Without the banana, it wasn't any better.  I still have quite a bit left...I will try it with OJ as someone else commented on doing.  Hope that improves the taste!",1
Excellent snack that's healthy and nutricious.  My son loves it!  It is a tad pricier than other brands but it tastes better.,5
"My dogs love this food! No allergies, more energy and nicer coats. My big dogs skin doesn't seem nearly as irritated and I am assuming with a little more use his skin will be normal again. We like it m2 ofore than any other I have seen. My only problem is that I have 2 dogs one huge one and 12.5lbs hardly make it a month. We really could use bigger bags or a qty discount. Plus I cannot find this in any stores so when I ran out I had to by a substitute...<br />UPDATE: My second shipment did not arrive at all. i have been trying to contact buyer but I cannot figure it out... Had to go back to the old food at least I realize that this food did not help with the dry itchy skin that the dogs have.. :{",3
"Firstly, I do drink a fair amount of coffee during the winter months.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I tend not to drink flavored coffee.  This is ground, flavored coffee.  Starbucks has not previously offered flavored coffees themselves because they know it will contaminate unflavored coffee in a grinder.  They are getting around this by only selling the coffee pre-ground, therefore, no customer will ever request it to be ground.<br /><br />When first opened, the quality is decent despite being pre-ground.  However, I do find, the quality of the product slips away fairly quickly being a ground coffee.<br /><br />Furthermore, again, I am not a particular fan of flavored coffees.  If I need a sweetener or flavor, I'd prefer to add it myself.  Nevertheless, this  vanilla flavored product is not terribly unpleasant.  I was able to enjoy it on a quiet morning or two when I wasn't demanding the very best.<br /><br />If flavored coffees is your thing, you will likely have no problems at all!",3
"Some of the flavors we have tried:<br />Diet Cola<br />I do not like diet cola. I don't like diet Coke, diet Pepsi or diet other drinks. We bought this flavor so we could make diet drinks for someone who might like a diet cola when we were making our own soda. However, this is really one of the better diet drinks that I have tried. If you make your own soda, this is a good one to try.<br /><br />Orange<br />This is the best one by far of all of the flavors we have tried. This flavor tastes just like the fanta orange soda. We love this one.<br /><br />Cola<br />This cola flavoring is ok. It's not great. You can easily make simple syrups that will not be a cola flavor but will taste much better than this flavor. This is the equivalent of RC Cola. Ok but it's not near as good as other name brand colas.",4
have tried this coffee from a friend it was great will buy. also will spread buy word of mouth. keep up the good work and thanks for having the k-cups of different varieties,4

"Plus:<br />- Good deal on the price and love the convenience of free delivery.<br />- Subscribe and Save saves money.<br />- Son ate it.<br />- Not always in stock at stores so online good buy.<br />- Like the 8 ounce size containers.<br /><br />Minuses:<br />- Son gets constipated with the Rice cereal, the Oatmeal is much better.<br />- Uses to much breast milk when mixing together.<br />- If you mix by directions won't be the right consistency to feed baby.<br /><br />I would buy one package first and see how your child reacts to the Rice before you buy the pack of 6 like I did.",3
"What are these people writing reviews thinking?  I bought the Creamy Chocolate Fudge based on the great reviews it got. It tastes terrible!  It has some type of aftertaste that I can't even describe. Gasoline?  At $3 each, it's tough to pour them down the sink.  And it's probably against some evironmental law to pour it down the gutter in the street.  Maybe I'll try the gas tank of my car......",1

I really wanted to believe the 100% positive feedback on here, but you should never believe<br />what you read, right?<br />I guess the 1st thing I look for in a cocoa is that the liquid has some body to it. This seemed just<br />watery and weak....it looks like a no-fat soymilk.<br />I added MORE than the recommended amount for the serving size and it was still just so-so.<br /><br />I am just not impressed with the way the powder globbed together and clumped and stuck to the spoon~yuk.<br />$5 a can for 12 serving when you can get the packets of the standard cocoa for 99 cents on sale for<br />the same amount of servings?<br />Granted, Amazon's price is better than the manufactures website since there is NO shipping through<br />here and shipping is at a premium through Stephen's Gourmet.<br />I would say unless you have tried this somehow elsewhere first, do not bother wasting your money to buy<br />6lbs of cocoa mix at one time. You might end up doing what I will have to do when you don't like it.<br />sigh<br />give it away~",3

"IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST HAPPY BABY PURCHASE, TRY AGAIN, THE REST ARE AMAZING! I love Happy Baby. My daughter eats this companies products all the time.  Chick Chick is great, Beef Stew is wonderful, but Gobble Gobble is weird.  My daughter didn't mind the taste, but I could not get over the texture.  It looked like a giant blob of wet dog food.  It was more putty-like than any other flavor.  I actually had to cut bites off of it.  I am grossed out just thinking about it.  Good thing there are other flavors.",2
this is the best tea I have ever had.  myself and many family members have this product on auto shipment.  Yes it's that good.  My family uses 3 cases a month.,2
"I have used this product before and it is excellent.  Unfortunately, when this shipment arrived the seal on the item was broken and some of the product had already been squirted out of the container into the lid.  I can't use it and according to Amazon's policies (pressurized container) I can't return it.  I can't even request a replacement to be sent - very unimpressed with Amazon.",1
"My dog did not like this at all, so I had to mix it with a brand she does like, Acana, so that it would not go to waste. After a few months after I purchased it, I got a notice for a recall.  I had to throw away all the food, which included an expensive bag of Acana since I keep the food in a big container and throw away the original bags. Amazon informed me that I had to deal with the seller on this issue even though I bought both products from Amazon.  So I informed Taste of the Wild of this in a letter with the refund request due to the recall and the cost of the Acana food, but they chose to ignore that.  I will not buy from them again.  Customer Service is not good.",1
"I have been buying this coffee for a couple years and love it.  Recently I started buying from amazon for convenience.  One thing that I have noticed is one week I will get a package that was roasted January 30.  The next order will be January 30.  And then the next order (received March 30) was roasted on January 16th.  Since this is ground coffee some people would say we have crossed the line on freshness.<br /><br />The coffee is still great but shipping first-in, first-out is something to strive for on items that have shelf lives.<br /><br />Adding to my review:<br /><br />I just received my April 30th shipment of two bags of Black Cat.  One bag has a roast date of 2/23/12 and the other was roasted on 1/16/12.  Based on this new information it is clear that amazon has no system to ship based on first-in, first-out or they are buying spot market unsold coffee to sell at full retail price in a venue they call Grocery & Gourmet Food.<br /><br />I love amazon, so it concerns me that they cannot manage something as simple as Grocery & Gourmet Food.  My next stop is Intelligentsia to see what they think about ground coffee that is roasted in January and sold to become a cup of coffee in May.<br /><br />One more addition:<br /><br />I finally got the answer - the coffee is roasted for espresso - when it passes the acceptable date to be ground for a good espresso they grind it for drip and sell it via amazon.",2
"My Bichons love the food.  And, the price cannot be beat.  But, when I previously wrote about a can that came without a label, I never heard back.  I have also had a problem with dented cans.

Would have liked to have heard back from them.",3
"Let me start out by saying I am no tea expert, my only comparisons are the usual major tea brands and restaurant bought tea.  So, from my experience, this is one of the best teas you can buy.  The sweetness does not taste like it came from a sugar pack, rather, it tastes like it is straight from a fruit and is not overwhelming.  The tea has a strong presence, but not bitter and bland.  It is like drinking something with many layers.  Although this is much better than soda, here is a comparison; the fizz of the soda is much like the tea (giving it some strength), while the sugar in the soda is much like the natural sweetness.  The fact that it is all natural and has many beneficial ingredients is simply icing on the cake.  This is a drink you can brag about to your friends.",5
"It tastes great and I like the ingredients and the things it doesn't have, like sugar.",4
"Taco Bell's Chipotle sauce is the texture of a weak ranch dressing. Possibly due to this texture, the flavor vaguely reminds me of ranch dressing with some Mexican spices added. It isn't very spicy hot. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the hottest thing I've eaten, I'd put this sauce around 3. It is about as spicy as a typical packaged taco seasoning from a kit.<br /><br />I tried the sauce seperately, on a bit of taco meat, and buried in a taco. I can't say that it ever tasted good, but it wasn't too bad when it was only providing a hint of flavor to the taco. I'd much rather have salsa or any of the great liquid hot sauces available online or at the supermarket.<br /><br />According to the label, it has 110 calories and 11g of fat in a 2-Tbsp serving. The top ingredient is soybean oil. It says ""contain milk, egg"" in the allergen section of the label.",2
"Well, this is frustrating as I really love this product for making decent quality lattes on my home machine. However, this is the second time in a row where the product has arrived damaged with cartons opened/punctured with leaky milk. It is hard to know what caused the damaged cartons as the original box is packed in a larger box with paper around it. I am thinking that because I am an Amazon Preferred customer, the orders are shipped via 2-day air. Maybe the air pressure in flight is causing packaging to fail. Fortunately, Amazon has been very good about dealing with the situation, but as I said it is frustrating not having good soy to make decent foam.",2
"My family loves cotton candy, but it can be very hard to find it in stores, and sometimes the product just isn't that good. So when I bought my own machine, I wanted the best deal and the best tasting sugar I could get. By purchasing the 5-pack of sugar, I got just what I wanted! The sugar spins out very light and disappears on your tongue instantly leaving behind a delicious flavor! My family hasn't tried the grape or orange yet, but we love the cherry, blue raspberry and pink vanilla flavors. I'm sure we'll love the others too. And it was a great buy for 5 nice sized jars. I look forward to eating more cotton candy soon!",5
I love the Kind Almond coconut bars so I decided to try the peanut butter dark chocolate.  It arrived in a box of 12 and all appear fresh.  The bars are both gooey and crunchy.  It is tastey but not as good as the almond coconut.  Very peanutty with a little but of nice dark chocolate.  I like that it is higher protein and that I get to feel like a I had a candy bar but without the crash of eating way too much sugar.  This bar is good but not my favorite,4

I found this Sarsaparilla Syrup while looking for alternatives.<br />Recipe for Sarsaparilla in the Soda Stream: Fill water up to the fill line of the Soda Stream bottle and carbonate the water as you would for any soda.  Using a measuring cup, remove 4 ounces of the carbonated water and discard. Measure 5 ounces of the Fee Brothers Sarsaparilla syrup, and slowly pour into the Soda Stream bottle. I always tilt the bottle so the water does not fizz up when the syrup hits.  Screw on the Soda Stream bottle cap and gently mix up.  I think the Sarsaparilla tastes best when refrigerated and served over ice!",5

"I bought the Mauna Loa Dry Roasted Macs with sea salt in Hawaii. They were so darn good, I wanted more, but they were very expensive in the supermarket. So, I ordered the 6-pack through Amazon.<br /><br />Not sure why, but the estimated ship time was a few weeks off and I had a hankering for macs. So, I bought a cheaper brand at the supermarket. They were awful; absolutely no flavor. I tried again with a mid-priced brand -- same problem. These I returned to the market.<br /><br />Then, I test-tasted one at Whole Foods. Awful.<br /><br />I started to think that maybe I wasn't remembering it right. Maybe these Mauna Loa macs weren't all that good. Then, finally, they arrived. Oh, my goodness! This is what a mac is supposed to taste like! Fresh, flavorful, just the right amount of salt.<br /><br />These are absolutely the best and, to date, I have not found a substitute. Store brand peanuts...sure. Store-brand -- or any other brand -- macadamia nut? Heck no!",5
"I'm wondering the same thing as the other buyers. If these are supposed to come from England, why is all the writing in Arabic? I did receive them a couple weeks before the printed expiration date, and they tasted fine, but isn't this false advertising?",3
By far the best price you can find anywhere believe me I looked. To do with the product; it tastes good and seems to enhance performance.,5
At first sip this K-cup flavor was not that bad however after that and all I can taste is the sucralose in it and well I really dislike artificial sweeteners.  If you are sensitive to artificial sweeteners I would avoid this product.,2
"Yes, I know it is chemicals that create the grape flavoring but this smelled like cheap grape bathroom cleanser and had a lot of oiliness that doesn't work well in my lollipops.",2
My local store quit carrying this product.  I greatly appreciate having this product available,5
"You get what you pay for.  This coffee is good, doesn't cost much, works well with Keurig machine but is certainly not to die for.  It is far from fresh coffee and doesn't taste any better than instant coffee.  But the convenience of the Keurig machine is great and this product enables this at a good price.",3
"I tried the berry flavored 5 hour energy today.  I wasn't particularly exhausted, just needed a little boost to chore through some housework that needed doing.  While the flavor was fine (tastes like liquid B-12), I didn't get any kind of boost from the 5 hour energy at all.  In fact, about an hour after taking it I decided to take a nap and slept just fine.  Bummer.  I was really hoping this would work as well as all the commercials say.  :(<br /><br />I will add that I'm a heavy coffee drinker and have been for many years, so perhaps that's why this had no effect.  I'm also not B-12 or folic acid deficient as I get injections for that.  Maybe if I WAS still vitamin deficient and didn't drink coffee this would give the desired boost.",2
"I've read so many reviews on the many brands and varieties of K-cups... coffee preferences are so subjective.  I did like the flavor of this coffee -- bold but not bitter.  As to ""strength"" I wish that there was more coffee in each K-cup... I am accustomed to Starbuck's strength, and I have to set my Keurig to medium-cup size to get the strength I need.  This is not as cost-effective as -- say Jet Fuel (but I found Jet Fuel too bitter.)<br />If Wolfgang Puck would add more coffee to its K-cups, this would be a perfect coffee for me.",4
"More than 1 month in time and have never received this order despite having shipped supposedly on 12/28/2009. No update on tracking provided. For the second time in the last two months, I will have to follow up on an Amazon order. Not worth the trouble in the future.",1
"Wow, I am VERY impressed with these cute little gummy packages. I just purchased a pack of 4 based on reviews and recommendations. I am glad I did! Here's a situation for you...Imagine you are eating a gummy bear, you take a bite, you pull the gummy and ""snap!"" the gummy breaks like it's a piece of taffy. Sound familiar? With these little gummies, it is a completely different experience. They almost melt in your mouth. They are also USDA certified which is an even bigger plus. Thank you Annie's for another great product!",5
Teh coconut aminos are great however it leaked all over the inside of the box. I actually only received half of a bottle because of this. :(,3
I bought a Victor fly trap and hung it from a post.  Two weeks later both my dogs were very sick.  I then realized that the glue holding the bag of bait to the plastic lid had let loose and dumped a bag full of stinky bait ant dead flies onto the ground.  My dogs ate this concoction and became very sick.  Now I've got a $235 vet bill because of a defective fly trap.  Do not buy this brand.,1
"After reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try, but was very disappointed. The reviews said it was sweet, or over sweet. yet mine was very tart. Don't know if they forget to put sugar in my cherries.  :(",1
"I've eaten gummies for years and I got stationed in Italy a few years back. I miss America, but I discovered these Frubidu (and other Haribo products) and I will never buy American gummies again. The flavor is ten times better than anything else and it costs (on average) half of what the Life Savers Gummies cost for 50% more gummy. Don't quote me on this, but I think it's actually healthier too. Haribo is the best.",5
"As other people have pointed out, you have to fish the remaining cocoa out of the pod after the brew cycle.  Even after that effort, you are left with a vending machine quality brew that leaves a lot to be desired.  I dress up the cocoa with real whipped cream and it does taste better, but after all that work I'd rather make the whole darn thing from scratch.  They need to got back to the test kitchen and get this right!",2
"Somewhere between a rice cake and a potato chip in texture, PopChips are an excellent low calorie snacking choice. I've tried all of the available flavors and here is my assessment of each:<br />Barbeque - A little too sweet for my taste but not bad overall<br />Jalapeno - High on Spice, not too salty, not much other flavor. I guess I was hoping for a cheesy jalapeno.<br />Original - Not super flavorful but great for dipping<br />Cheddar - Yummy<br />Parmesan Garlic - So Garlicky. Good but make for stinky breath<br />Salt & Pepper - Good<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - If you like Vinegar you might like these but I wasn't as big of a fan of them as I expected<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Hands down the BEST flavor",5
"I initially purchased this because I wanted to try a gum that did not contain Phenylalanine.  The packaging of Glee Gum sorta reminds me of a box of chicle tab gum.  The price and flavor of the gum is pretty good, however I had a few issues:<br /><br />1. This gum WILL stick to your teeth!  It has stuck to my teeth each time I've chewed it. My friends have tried this gum and have complained about it sticking to their teeth, too.  It was difficult to remove from my back molars.  I eventually had to brush my teeth to remove all traces of gum from my mouth.<br />2. The flavor doesn't last as long as I hoped, so I wound up going through the entire package rather quickly.",3
Its a nice tea and I add honey to it.  It could be mintier though.,4
"This is an ok hot sauce. I read the ingredients and thought it would add a bit of sweet to help balance the hotness. First ingredient is peppers. Ok, great. It's what I expected. Second ingredient is sugar. Ahhhh, that's good, too. The problem? There is no sweetness at all. I was hoping for a really nice blend of the two but it just isn't here. Don't believe I'll be buying this again. But, as a 'disclaimer', it IS hot sauce so I really like that part. If you just like it hot, you'll love this. Product was shipped in a very timely manner and I would use this vendor again for other things.",3
"Why bother creating an alternative grain (that's naturally gluten-free) cereal that's NOT gluten free?!?!?  I bought this knowing millet is generally gluten-free... glad I did more research before I ate it!  Arrowhead Mills has other gluten-free products...  Why not this?  On the packaging, it also DOES NOT include an allergen warning as most food product do now that contain, tree nuts, soy, milk and wheat. Incomplete labeling. Oh well, what could be a great product is sadly not.",1
"I ordered smaller quantities of different teas and found out what I liked. I tried 1 lb bags, then 2 lb bags and it lasts me a long time is less expensive and I have enough to share with my staff",4
"Coffee has very smooth taste.  I had to do some research as to how to use the pods.  Best way I found to use pod was to cut open pod and place into coffee filter or just place unopened pod into coffee filter.  It worked quite well and the coffee was not weak, but had a strong smooth taste.",4
"When I adopted my rescue lab/chow mix, Sammie, the shelter said she was eating Purina One Lamb and Rice. So that is what I kept feeding her without knowing what I know now that I have read this site. But it seemed ok - she had really hard poops sometimes but otherwise seemed great and her coat was soft and shiny, enough so that people commented on it. THEN after the formula change this year, the itching started and the poops became worse (hard more often.) She developed red spots in her ears and a yeast infection in each one.  Then her fur got rough, dusty looking and then started shedding more than anything I'd seen in the 2 years I had her. It seemed like she lost 1/2 her fur! The vets told me this was not likely the new food formula of her same food...well after hundreds of dollars of vet bills and a miserable summer for her all itchy all of the time, I decided to change her food. I picked Halo after talking to a friend who is in to nutrition (people and dogs.) I changed her over slowly - about 9 days. The itching and fur remained a problem...until the day she was only on Halo. Poof! No more itching - that very day no more itching. After a month her fur was shiny and soft but sparce (I'd added Halo's Dreamcoat supplement too.) After 2 months her fur is shinier, softer and more full and lush than ever. Her poops are regular like clockwork and soft - like they never were on Purina One. And she *loves* the food! (I do a mix of canned and kibble.) She has a passion for that food she never had for Purina One - even before the formula change. I wish I'd listened to my instincts and switched the food after the first symptoms! Whatever Purina did to that food is a nightmare.  Read about in on line - you'll see many people have had very bad results since the formula change last summer.",1
"I used to love Hamburger Helper as a kid so I had to try this out, usually I try to eat healthy and as close to the ground as possible without ingesting too many refined products but once in a while it's okay to indulge in some cheesy goodness, and this was pretty nice.  A little salty but I do like salt and often have to hold back, it's a nice change from a regular protein free macaroni and cheese when I truly don't have time or energy to whip up a whole meal from scratch. This is best eaten from a bowl on a couch in front of the tv followed by a nap! Yum and cozy but definitely not for every day.",4
This is the second time I've purchased this peppercorn.  I love my pepper and this particular product is great.  Also worth the money.,5
"This is my favorite first thing in the morning coffee.  During the week I get up between 3:30 am and 4:00 am so I need something to get me going and this coffee does the trick.  I have tried other BOLD coffees, but this is by far my favorite.",5
"The coffee is just OK. It's very mild, almost bordering on weak. Would buy it again if the price was right.",3
"The ingredients go and work well<br /><br />However, the Onion, Onion Juice should well be cooked down for babies, etc<br /><br />Year 3 & 4 + will be different.  PLEASE Cook Down the Onion content PLUM before<br />packaging!<br /><br />Great formula combo; ingenious, really.<br /><br />Thanks again,<br /><br />p.s. comments welcome<br /><br />p.p.s Cook down the Onions and get a 5 without hesitation.",4
"My son is allergic to peanuts, so when I saw this I had to try it because I LOVE peanut butter.  The taste is a little different, but the texture is the same.

"this gingerbread house was so easy to put together and so cute!  built and decorated with my 2 year old in about 20 minutes.  the icing was pre-made so i didn't have to mix anything which is great.  just cut a hole in the corner of the bag and go.  just don't eat the icing...yuck! my son liked it but, well, he is 2.  i only gave it 4 stars bc 2 of the gingerbread pieces were broken when it arrived but since it was so close to christmas i didn't have time to return it so i used them.  just used some extra icing and covered the cracks with candy.",4
I had a hard time drinking this tea as it tastes like cardboard! There's no taste or flavor. I don't know if it actually works to strengthen the uterus as I wasn't able to make myself have it for the couple of months required. I'm not sure if all raspberry tea tastes like this or just this brand.,2
I love this drink and have been drinking it each day for years. It's how I begin my day! I thought it was discontinued a few months back and I was hugely disappointed. I looked on Amazon recently and saw that it was available. I was ecstatic to say the least!,5
"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>* this review was originally posted for the 3 oz size, a verified purchase by me on Amazon)<br /><br />I purchased three well reviewed brands of catnip for Tristan, my six month old Savannah cat. In the video, I have just placed down three plates of catnip from freshly opened packages. The brands from left to right are <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028HN5A"">Sojos Certified Organic Catnip</a>, in the middle is the product in this listing - Cosmic Catnip (this video review shows the 3oz jar), and on the far right we have <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VNEII0"">Frontier Catnip Leaf & Flower C/s Certified Organic, 16 Ounce Bag</a>.<br /><br />Like the little bear at Goldilock's table, Tristan tries a bit from each plate; at the end of this clip he seemed to have no *overwhelming* preference for any particular brand though. As far as his physical reactions to each (sampled separately), he did not act ""stoned"" nor hyper, he merely scratches on his scratch pad a bit more with catnip than without catnip and gives himself a good stretch. He also strongly prefers catnip infused mice to non-catnip mice and I'm happy to oblige.<br /><br />As far which *I* prefer, if it's all the same to the cat (and it seems that it is) here's my take on things -<br /><br />The Frontier brand is by far the least expensive at just under fifteen dollars for 16oz. It is slightly more coarse and seems to have a little bit of stems mixed in. VERY fragrant though and turned out to be a close second favorite of the cat reviewing the products. I would definitely buy the Frontier brand again and use it for stuffing toys generously or for ""marinating"" his little cloth mice. Organic and suitable even for human consumption if you like it as a tea.<br /><br />The Sojos brand (1oz can) is the most expensive - by my calculations comes to over a hundred dollars for 16oz!. The description says it produces a ""harmless, euphoric state"" but we saw no evidence of that. Smelled fresh but definitely a milder aroma than the other two brands; had the finest chopped leaves of the three. Hand harvested if that is important you or your cat.<br /><br />With the Cosmic Cat brand, we *may* have a winner.....<br /><br />When the camera was off, Tristan returned to the Cosmic Cat sample several times more so than the other brands. I repeated this little taste test for the next two days and Cosmic Cat had a small but definite edge over the competition. I'd have to say that I agree with his choice; the Cosmic Cat brand leaves are darker and more fragrant than the other two brands. The leaves are also cut just right - not too fine/not too large, and no stems or coarse pieces. I find the Cosmic Cat brand's price reasonable, the storage container is very convenient, and the 3oz* size is enough not to be too little and not so much to get stale and spoil.<br /><br />Hope you find this information useful in choosing for your own cat or kitten.",4
"This is a popular item in our office, we always need extra on hand.  The quantity is exactly what we need and the delivery is fast - so that we are never without!",5
"So after comparing this to Jay Robb, I can say that this protein is not as good. The taste isn't as good, and it doesn't mix that easy. I don't think it is horrible, just not that good.<br /><br />One thing I like about the Jay Robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs. I sent Healty N' Fit an email asking where they get their eggs from, but they didn't reply. It is a little cheaper, but I found the Jay Robb at Vitamin Shoppe for 20 per 12ozs, which isn't bad. I have to say that I don't like the dudes picture on the bottle, but that's my only complaint.",2
"The Blue monkey coconut water is absolutely natural product that tastes great when cold. Unfortunately, almost all of the cans were pretty bent or smashed. Other than that the quality of the product inside is top-notch. Oh, and Blue monkey is a cute name for coconut water.",4
"Tried this for the first time last night and really liked it , it had a great taste . Good for when you want something but do not want to ruin your diet . bought them in the grocer for 7.99 . I thought that was expensive ..Hopefully i can find them cheaper elsewhere",4
I like the flavor of coconut water. I love the flavor of mango.<br />This tastes nothing like the combination of the two.<br />Can somebody please explain what 100% natural from concentrate means?,1
We really love this product. We discovered it while on a hiking trip in the Smokie Mountains. It was in of those cute country Stores in Gatlinburg. It's sooo delicious! Just wonderful yummy goodness on waffles and pancakes. We have purchased more bottles and flavors since our first purchase. We also love the Raspberry.,4
This wonderful sea salt is both beautiful and healthy for you. It takes less to season. Anyone who is concerned abot salt and diet will love this product,5
"The whole idea of a Spongebob Ginger Bread Pineapple is really great, but the sticker that says ""Use By"" Has a 10 JN 16 date on it. If thats 2010- this is not good! I think it would be fun to make and a cute decoration, but my son is going to want to eat it.  The least the seller could do is to check the expiration date! Its right on the front of the box! Not happy at all!!!",2
"Earl Grey was one of my favorite flavors before I got into loose leaf tea and I still come back to it on a regular basis. The comforting aroma of bergamot the it's flavor mixed with black tea is hard to beat. Of the many brands of Earl Grey I've tried over the years, H&B's is without a doubt one of the better ones.<br /><br />It rises above an average tea bag in that it can produce a well balanced cup over at least two steepings. Just brew it for a shorter time than recommended on the packaging. For me it is under 2 minutes for the first cup and longer for the second. It mixes well with cream and sugar too, though I prefer mine black. Another plus is it's ability to taste good as a cold tea as well as a hot one. The citrusy bergamot flavor is prominent in this mix so perhaps that is its secret.<br /><br />In any event, quality tea leaves and flavorings are evident here and I would purchase it again. There are better loose leaf tea blends available, but as a bagged tea it is hard to beat.<br /><br />~ Kort",4
"Amazon is wrong, checked there site and my box i just received they ARE gluten free there is NO barley in it.Check it.<br /><br />[...]",5
Son likes it because it is sweet but not too sweet and he would definitely like to get it again.  He gave it a four star rating instead of five because it doesn't seem very healthy with the coating of frosted sugar on top of each bite.  He did like the cinnamon flavoring.,4
I really thought that I could make a sugar-free chocolate milk or have something to have in my cocoa since I'm trying to reduce my sugar intake. This product is horrible. It doesn't dissolve into solution (hot or cold) and tastes chalky and not at all sweet. Just breakdown and use the extra calories with the agave nectar. It has calories but is much better than wasting your money on this low-cal alternative.,1
"I'm a fan of Velveeta cheese and even enjoy their shells and cheese, so I had high hopes for this. Although my 6 year old daughter liked it, I am not a fan. It's okay at best. The flavor does not accurately represent the deliciousness of the original Velveeta cheese. I would suggest you at least give it a try. I will purchase it since my daughter enjoys it, but it will not be a staple in our household.",3
"What I received did not taste good at all. I saw this on the food network with high hopes as I love everything pork and bacon is at the top of the list. I was shocked that I did not like it. It had a very funny aftertaste that reminds me of bacon drippings that have been saved in a can and not refrigerated. One other reviewer said they received theirs in a cold pack. Mine did not come that way, it came in a regular box with paper around it but no cold packs. Maybe the 3 jars I received had gone bad but I have no way of knowing. What I received and tasted could not be what all these other 5 star reviewers receieved. I may order another batch later on after the sting of this purchase is gone and will update this review if it is different then what I received this time. All I can say is beware that it appears it might go bad very easily.",1
Green Mountain is one of my favorite coffee brands.  Breakfast blend is mellow and a great way to start your day.,4
"I received this product in return for writing a review.<br /><br />I appreciated the ingredients of this formulation, which are great for overall health as well as bone/joint health.  I am not a nutrition expert but I am somewhat knowledgeable and though the nutritional requirements might be different in some ways, dogs are mammals.<br /><br />One reviewer stated that it doesn't work well with dry food and I wholeheartedly agree.  It falls to the bottom rapidly.<br /><br />Now, I feed my dogs organic dog food (since they could eat solid food and they are 12 and 11.  My dogs love vegetables, so I conducted a test.  I dusted a vegetable with the powder.  Yorkie #1 didn't know what to think and spit the veggie out but immediately after ""contemplating"" the taste and she returned to broccoli and ate the entire piece. Yorkie #2 didn't pause once she got her broccoli with the powder.<br /><br />Next, I offered two identically sized broccoli pieces one dusted with the powder and one without powder.  Yorkie #1 ate the coated one first.  Yorkie #2 went for the uncoated piece first.  Considering that they are a bit picky but absolutely love fruits and vegetables, if they didn't want to eat this food, I believe both would leave the coated piece behind.<br /><br />I do believe that this is not ""candy"" but has some appeal.<br /><br />However, that said, it doesn't coat even wet vegetables well.<br /><br />I would consider buying the drops for regular use but I would definitely need to observe a noticeable improvement in their well being to justify the cost.",3
The outer layer of the cookie is good but the center is far from creamy. It's rock hard and inedible IMO. I bought these and after eating a couple they sat in our pantry until they went stale and were tossed. I won't buy these again. However MI-DEL makes other cookie varieties that are delicious--my whole family loves the GF arrowroot animal cookies and the GF ginger snaps.,1
"All of the Happy Baby Stage 2 Foods I have ordered have had an excellent flavor, but the puree is a very watery consistency that requires me to mix in cereal just so it holds onto the spoon long enough to make it to my daughters mouth. If your baby is past basic introductions where you water it down to a soupy consistency I would try another brand or the next stage or two up. Very disappointed because the flavor is great.",3
"This just taste awful and none of my family would drink it, so we poured it out. We will continue to purchase the regular and vanilla Oregon Chai, both concentrate and mix packets are both good, but just not this terrible ""slightly sweet"" and ""totally flavorless.""",1
"This flavor has a much more mild flavor than the Black Cherry flavor I reviewed earlier.  While the juices in this can are apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry, and strawberry in order of their respective strengths, the strawberry flavor stands out the most.  I enjoyed this flavor more because the sweetness was not overpowering and the carbonation remained light so I didn't feel like I wanted to drink a glass of water immediately after.  It's a little expensive for an 8.3oz can but I'd purchase this again.",3
"I love my Soda Stream, and most of the mixes I've used have been quite good (pretty much any of their fruit flavors, their Dr. Pepper substitute,  Root Beer and Energy Drink have all been quite tasty), however the one flavor that really stands out as a disappointment is the cola flavor. I can forgive the fact that it doesn't taste like Coke or Pepsi-- I have tried other ""b-list"" colas that tasted good in their own way-- however, this one is overall just plain bland. It's not sweet enough, and it lacks the ""kick"" that I expect from a cola. I tried making the most of it by adding additional ingredients-- once I used vanilla, and it made the soda even more bland. The other time i used some cheap whisky my room mate bought, and it was probably the nastiest mixed drink I've ever had (I'm not a heavy drinker though, keep in mind, and I blame the crappy alcohol more than the soda for that one).<br /><br />I have not explored other options for cola syrups yet, but this is one I don't expect I'll be buying again unless they change the formula. I'm pretty sure there's got to be a better option out there that does not involve spending $150 on a 5 gallon bag of Coca Cola syrup (which would have the high fructose corn syrup that I've been trying to avoid anyway).",2
"I love Popchips. However, I did not like this flavor at all. The garlic flavor was too intense.",2
"If you expect to receive 3 bottles like the description states...you will only receive one. Other than that, they sent it in a timely fashion and it tastes great.",3
"This brings back wonderful childhood memories. I had not eaten Mallomars in years and I have to say that they are as delicious as I remembered them. The base is a chocolate wafer with marshmallow on top, all covered with chocolate. I love the way the kind of explode in your mouth. The base on some of the cookies had broke apart from the upper half. I don't know if that happened during shipping or if the cookies might have been slightly old. They tasted fine and I would certainly recommend them. Wonderful with milk!",4
"I eat a lot of healthy food and am willing to try new ones.  So recently I tried this cereal.  The only plus I can report is that it had a lot of raisins in it.  Which is a good thing because, without the raisins it would have been completely tasteless.  But the worst thing about it is that it contains some very hard bits that almost broke a tooth.<br /><br />That was my experience the first time, eating it cold with milk.  I noticed that the box suggested it could also be eaten warm...I figured that heating it with milk might soften the hard bits, so I decided to try it (I was also trying desperately to avoid throwing away the $5.49 investment).  My theory was wrong.  The hard bits are un-softenable.  I dumped the rest of the box of cereal...and $5.49 + tax...in the compost bin.",1
"This dog food arrived quickly and was packed and wrapped well.  Food was fresh and smelled good which is why I gave it two stars.  However, I will not be buying again.  My dog has had the worst farts since starting this food.  I've had her on it for ten days hoping that she would adjust to it.  She rode with me in the car today and I couldn't get the windows down fast enough.  Whew!  Not recommended.",2
"Best almonds I've had in a while, fresh perfectly salted, Excellent. Wish they would be a little cheaper since as soon as the get to my house they're gone, would order weekly.",5
"I was very excited to tear into this box of cookies when it arrived today, and I am sorry to say I'm left a little let down. The cookies are soft, but they are also rather dry and crumbly. I'd place it in between a Grandma's brand cookie (nice and tender) and a pecan sandie/chips ahoy type cookie (deliberately, delightfully crispy). I really couldn't taste much almond or chocolate, either, which was sad.<br /><br />So while they're not gross, I could definitely make a similar cookie at home and it would be *much* more tasty and tender - not to mention with far fewer ingredients in.",3
"This isn't horrible.  I still drink it, but I am never going to buy it again.  For starters, its WAY bitter.  I normally like dark black/bold coffe, but this has a bitter finish that is not very appealing.<br /><br />I've tried most of the k-cup coffee, and I think Caribou's Blend coffee is probably my favorite.  On the lighter end of the scale, the Coffee People's Donut Shop coffee is also pretty good.",2
I know it's been said but I just want to echo this is Hydrogenated - DON'T BUY THIS!!!,1
"I was hesitant about ordering this the first time, but was surprised at how good it tastes. It has a true black tea flavor with just the right amount of lemon. I used it up quickly and have reordered it. Occasionally, I add a little sweetener but most people probably wouldn't feel the need to do so.",4
"Unfortunately, I found these largest to taste nothing like barbecue. For the money, the amount you recieve isn't worth it. However, i had a decent amount of fun showing these to my friends. All in all, I wouldn't reccommend it.",3
"I was shocked to see this.  Maybe I've misunderstood what they are selling here, but I don't think so.  Locally I can buy a box like this that has 36 1.5 oz bags for $7.80.  I gave this 3 stars because the product is great, but the price is extremely high ($22.97 at posting).",3
"I was skeptical going in- two tablespoons for 45 calories while regular peanut butter was 180? Yeah, right.<br /><br />So it may be a bit spendy and you DO have to mix it yourself. Small price to pay! Tastes even better than regular peanut butter and I can eat it daily, getting the nutrients of peanuts without the fat and extra calories!!<br /><br />A month later, and I'm almost done with the bag.

"I don't know if this particular one is recalled though. Just though I'd give a heads up though.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free. no dye or by product food.<br />I found that Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free food made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named ""Taste Of The Wild"" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for ""SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION""<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these ""better than store"" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the ""better"" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying",1
"I used this product in a Solofill cup on the ten oz setting on a Cuisinart SS700.  The first thing I noticed is that the packet doesn't tear open easily so I had to get the scissors.  A bit annoying.  Second, even though the coffee is sealed in the packet, there is no fresh coffee smell when I tear the packet open.  Third, the amount of coffee included just fits in the solofill cup.<br /><br />The next thing I noticed was that the brewed coffee did not flow as easily as it does with a K-cup so maybe the amount of coffee is actually too much.  It was a thin stream of coffee that threatened to stop flowing but did end up filling the cup,  although with no satisfying bit of foam at the top.<br /><br />Taste: typical restaurant coffee rather than coffeehouse coffee, that is, plain, uninteresting.  As one reviewer mentioned, muddy.  Sediment at the bottom of the cup.  The kind of coffee you swallow mindlessly with the breakfast special at the local greasy spoon.<br /><br />I only paid $7.50 and at this writing you can get Ekojava more cheaply than that, but I don't recommend it.  Splurge for a real k-cup or at least put freshly ground coffee into your Solofill.",2

This most recent shipment was my third - and I noticed that the can was different. But nothing on the can indicated that the product had changed, so I thought it was only a cosmetic makeover. WRONG.<br /><br />Many people have noted in their reviews that they like this product because it is not as sweet as the other flavored coffees; well, now it is, AND there's less coffee flavor.<br /><br />I looked up the company's website and e-mailed customer support. They confirmed that they have ""reformulated"" Cafe Francais, and said would take my comments into consideration.

"I'm a sucker for chai tea. I saw this drink at my grocery store and bought it just to try it out, I'd never heard of it before. I bought both the Vanilla and the Spice Chai. I went home, made myself a cup, and was absolutely blown away at the amazing flavor. I went back and bought more so I could have some at work, some at home, and some on my motorcycle. I even sent some to my boyfriend in California in a care package (he's in the military and going through training) and now he's hooked on it, too. I love arriving at home, making myself a cup, and relaxing after a day's work. Several months after discovering this treasure, I was out to lunch and realized I wanted some chai tea. I didn't have anymore drink mix with me, so I stopped at my local coffee shop and picked up an iced chai. I've been ruined! I didn't care for the taste of the chai from my coffee shop anymore! I even tried starbucks iced chai and found myself very disappointed in how fake it tasted. Bottom line: nothing compares to the flavor of this chai drink mix. On top of that, there's 13 servings of chai per 10 oz container, which costs about $3.50... I usually pay $3.50 for one small chai from my coffee shop. This drink mix costs about 25 cents per serving. It tastes better and is way more affordable. What more could you ask for?",5
"For years I have bought and used products from the Newman's Own line, and I have always loved them.

The ginger is pretty strong in these, which I love. They are a hard, small cookie - perfect for dipping in hot tea. A serving size is 5 cookies with a low calorie count of only 130. There are no trans fats, only 180 mg sodium, and 12 sugars per serving.<br /><br />These make me think of autumn, cool weather, and hot tea. Recently when I had a cold and didn't feel like eating much, these little ginger snaps and hot tea were just the thing to revive my spirits!",5
"While I don't use poppy seeds all that often, you really can't beat this price, especially when a little McCormick bottle of the stuff costs a whopping 8 bucks at the supermarket.

It was a lot more than I was expecting.",4
This cat food is terrible for cats.  The only reason it gets 2 stars is because of the nice handled pail it comes in.  I throw out the food and reuse the pail for for a paint bucket.  Seriously look at the ingredients.  If the food coloring and preservatives dont stop you in your tracks look at how much quality meat goes into this....none.  I fed this to my 2 cats over a year.  The female got extremely fat and fur came out in clumps.  The male which was only 2 years old got sent to the animal hospital with urinary tract blockage.  The hospital bill was $1500 to save the cat.  Moral of the story... spend a little more for quality food like EVO or CORE and save way more by having healthy cats.  There is no doubt that this food and others like it is inappropriate to feed cats and will cause all sorts of maladies over time.,2
"Essentia is purified water, with electrolytes added ""for a difference you can taste"".  For me, the water is basically tasteless, and I actually prefer the taste of natural spring water (for example, Crystal Geyser or Calistoga).  However, the water tastes very clean, and anyone who is very particular about what he/she ingests will probably love this water.<br /><br />Essentia's selling point is its 9.5 pH.  According to my online research, ordinary tap water is more acidic, with an average 7 pH.  The Mayo Clinic reports that proponents of alkaline water claim it can neutralize acid in the bloodstream, boost energy and metabolism, improve absorption of nutrients, slow the aging process, slow bone loss, and help with disease resistance.  However, the Mayo Clinic also states that these claims have not been verified by researchers.  Debunkers of alkaline water health claims point out that Kansas City tap water has 11 to 12 pH, and that KC residents are no healthier than people in the rest of the U.S.<br /><br />Essentia is purified by reverse osmosis.  Wikipedia explains that reverse osmosis is a filtration method that removes large molecules and ions from solutions by applying pressure to force a solution through a membrane.<br /><br />I rate Essentia water at 4 stars, because it tastes very pure.  However, it is up to the individual to decide whether the water is worth the price, especially as compared to bottled spring water, or to ordinary tap water that is filtered with an attachment (for example, the very good <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006WNMI"">Culligan Faucet Filter</a>) or a pitcher equipped with a charcoal filter (for example, the excellent <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041LF3HE"">3M Filtrete Water Pitcher</a>).",4
"I wanted to try this for the convenience factor. The flavor is very nice. It also doesn't add more liquid to a recipe, so it's great in sauces.

"Google ""propylene glycol"" to find out why.  I bought this product, along with several others, without running the ingredients by my wife first (a nurse of 30 years) she<br />was surprised when she noticed it.. we went a googling, and poured my $50 order down the drain afterwards.  There's ""pure"" and then there's ""not so much"".....<br /><br />from the website:  [...]<br /><br />Propylene Glycol<br /><br />A cosmetic form of mineral oil found in automatic brake and hydraulic fluid and industrial antifreeze. In the skin and hair, propylene glycol works as a humescent, which causes retention of moisture content of skin or cosmetic products by preventing the escape of moisture or water. The Material Safety Data Sheet warns users to avoid skin contact with propylene glycol as this strong skin irritant can cause liver abnormalities and kidney damage.<br />Also used in:<br /><br />  Tyre sealant<br />  Rubber cleaner<br />  De-icer<br />  Stain removers<br />  Fabric softener<br />  Degreaser<br />  Paint<br />  Adhesive<br />  Wallpaper stripper<br /><br />I wrote the company about this concern and they never responded....",1

"The pack of six bottles was delivered in a timely manner but when I opened up a bottle, the juice tasted sour.  I thought that it had spoiled in transit and considered returning the remaining bottles but then I noticed the very bottom line on the product label,""Enriched with Organic Lemon Juice"".  It was too much trouble to return and, while I do not totally enjoy the tartness that the lemon juice adds, it is at least still pure and organic and healthy.<br /><br />I would not have ordered the product had I known that it was not JUST carrot juice but carrot juice with ""organic lemon juice"" added to it.  Perhaps this is why the price is so very right but I feel misled.<br /><br />It takes some getting used to if you are seeking the taste of carrot juice.  Before you order this item, I would suggest you buy a small bottle of carrot juice and squeeze some lemon juice into it to preview the effect of having lemon juice flavored carrot juice.",3
"tried another healthy choice brand before this brand & all 5 cats hated it but then was weaning them off the fast food friskies & cat chow anyway, but this bag they've all taken to eating at once. Little round pellets are easy for them to eat, especially the eldest which is 11 now & she was vomitting twice a day every day before I decided they had to have a healthier diet & this cat food fits the bill perfectly. I'm so glad I found this!!! I love my babies & they'll prob outlive me lol. Haven't noticed any improvement in their coats etc but it's just now into Fall & growing thicker. Did notice one of my males had really dry skin when I'd scratch his back & now that's mostly gone so if it's changing weather or healthier diet, who knows. Just know he's better so that's all that matters.",4
"I am a fan of this brand, but was extremely disappointed when I tried the Bunny Graham Friends. I noticed immediately upon opening the brand new box that there was a strange odor. I proceeded to open the metallic bag, and almost instantly correlated the smell with that of a mylar balloon (those metallic helium balloons). Sadly, the graham snacks were impregnated with the smell and taste as well. I'm all for ""green"" packaging and such, and realize the hidden dangers of plastic packaging, but surely there is another way to package these without ruining the flavor or earth. I will, however, continue to buy the macaroni and other products from this line, but I will never waste my money on this item again.",1
I bought this because I love Torani's sugar-free Mango syrup and figured all their products would taste just as wonderful. Bad assumption. Now I'm stuck with 3 bottles that are not going to be used because they taste so horrible. Maybe I can give them to my sister.,1
"Alright so this is a pretty lame review, I'll admit, but I can't find a lot to say about Essentia Drinking Water. It doesn't taste bad so that's something. It doesn't really taste like anything that I could pick up. Water is water. I'm sure if you did a blind taste test between Essentia and a couple other brands of bottled water there might be some difference but as is it is pretty...watery? So don't buy it for its taste but at the same time don't NOT buy it for its taste.<br /><br />If you're purchasing Essentia is is probably for the ""health benefits."" So if that is something important to you (not a real concern to me) then you might want to consider purchasing this but do your research first. Apparently health claims are unverified.<br /><br />I can't really imagine a reason for spending $30 for bottled water but hey, different strokes for different folks.",3

"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:55 Mins<br /><br /></span>I have a 43 pound border collie mix. He needs to be mentally stimulated so I bought this toy for him. He gets his dinner through this jug sometimes.<br /><br />I was nervous about purchasing it because of the reviews stating how the rubber ""rope"" was easily chopped, but I figured I might be able to replace it with a real rope if it breaks. To my surprise, the purple rope hasn't broke and I had this toy for several months now. My dog has been chewing it with his molars, but not very often. Also he may not be as a strong chewer as the dogs from other reviews.<br /><br />When my dog first recieved this toy, he kept pawing at it and pushing it with his nose panting with exsaustion. It took about an hour until he almost got the one cup of kibble that was in it. Later he got used to it and now he has a strategy. He pushes the back of the bottle straight up. He can empty the bottle in about 10 minutes now.<br /><br />A major problem I have with this toy is that the rubber spikes and the rope gets pretty nasty. It picks up hair from the carpet and dry food crumbs from the kibble inside the bottle and builds up to a disgusting slimy gunk. It is extremely hard to get all the crap out between the spikes and the inner edges of the rope.<br /><br />Over all it is a good toy for my medium sized mutt. It just gets dirty and hard to clean.",4
"I'm a big fan of very bold, very dark coffee and have tried literally dozens of bold k cups.<br /><br />Timothy's Midnight Magic, Rainforest Espresso, Emeril's and Tully's French Roast are also dark coffees that I will buy as well but this one has the best flavor for me. It is not bitter and muddy looking, it's smooth. Most importantly, it gives a flavorful, not weak cup of java on the 9.5 ounce setting. Not many k cups do that. They become coffee flavored water at the 9.5 ounce size.",4
"Was very disappointed when unable to find this delicious Chicken Helper at local stores anymore ... and very happy to find it could be ordered through Amazon!

My hair felt over conditioned and their was some build up after just using it once. It was impossible to style after using this. My hair was flat, flat, flat and sort of oily looking. In all fairness, this might be a great product for dry and damaged hair that is frizzy or heavy but that isn't my issue.",2
"When they say a 16 oz bag, they aren't saying it by volume but by weight.  This bag is MASSIVE.  It comes vacumme sealed and the smell is awesome when you open it.

"I work from home and traditional 'home' products don't work for me.  They are also more expensive and wasteful.<br /><br />My coffee solution is a plumed-in Bunn commercial coffee-maker, air-pot and this creamer.  I've experienced eventual clogging of the pump before each bottle is empty and resorted to another container to pour it from.<br />Nestle should source a STAINLESS, commercial grade pump that can be disassembled for cleaning periodically and re-utilized.  This will decrease product cost and also cut down on plastic waste.<br />Here's something that works for the pump:  When installing a new pump: 1. Hold the top part of the shaft (just under the cap) in one hand while using the other to turn the pump so that it pops up.  2.DO NOT tighten the cap more than about 1 turn.  This will give the pump enough stability to use, but I've found that this process prevents the pump from plugging up.  It may be due to air flowing in from the cap vs. through the pump, gradually thickening & drying the product and plugging the pump up.",4
"I found Grovers Square at my supermarket this week and decided to try it strictly based on cost. It's not bad at all if all you have is a keurig machine and 8 bucks (for the 18 cup box)!

"I am used to KAL stevia, and having read some of the other reviews, perhaps the one I received was from a bad batch. But - I have had to use AT LEAST 4-5 times as much compared to KAL to sweeten most items, and for some items (i.e. my high protein breakfast drink) it just disappears. Never has quite the same ""sweet"" effect of the KAL either.",2
I am usually not a fan of flavored coffe or coconut for that matter and when I bought the sampler pack of Jamaica Me Crazy I honestly did not see that it was a flavored coffee.  The aroma that it gives off while brewing transports me to a tropical island somewhere.  The flavor of the coffee is very subtle and leaves no after taste at all.  A great new addition to my coffee line up.,4
"I got this for my husband, and he drank a few of these pods, and has yet to use anymore. I think this coffee is too weak, so less water is recommended. Thanks for the free sample, it's fun trying new things. This isn't the best of coffee's yet it's worth a try. Update: I cut up five packets, and put it in a five cup filter, with full amount of water, and the coffee brewed perfectly and tasted really good. I tried this instead of using the one shot packets, and it worked for me.",2

"Today is Lammas Day (a.k.a. Lughnasadh).  What better way to celebrate the ""first harvest"" that's with a nice farmhouse Saison ale?  HENNEPIN SAISON ALE is a quality summertime Belgian brew:  It has a nice golden color and lingering head, a good hoppy flavor, and a veritable 7.7% ABV.  Additionally, in terms of value, this is one of the more cost effective Belgian ales on the market today.<br />I consider myself to be a bit of a fanatic when it comes to Belgian ales; I can honestly say, with all sincerity, that this is a good Belgian ale at a reasonable price.  This one will be part of my regular rotation.",4
"I re-potted all my plants in the fall of 2010 and spent a fortune all winter trying to get rid of these bugs! I never even considered the soil.. I thought I brought them in from a new plant purchase but couldn't understand how they could multiply so rapidly. When I heard my husband clapping his hands as they were flying around his desk downstairs (where there are no plants) I went into my potting room and opened the bag. BUSTED! I couldn't get that bag outside fast enough!<br />I ended up throwing out many of my favorite plants (some very old ones) and now I'm starting from scratch. In this case I didn't get what I paid for but a whole lot more than I bargained for!<br />As for the reviewer who claims it's from over watering...I can't agree.  I've been an avid indoor and outdoor gardener for over 30 years and I NEVER experienced anything like this.  Yes, be sure you have good drainage and don't water all plants the same. Different plants have different requirements. Maybe all bags aren't infested but I'll not take that chance again!",1

Hopefully the contents, picture, listing will all be corrected so others are not misled.",1
I bought a can of these about a mounth ago and thay were great. I wanted more so I bought a case of them on Amazon and thay are not the same quality. The taste is the same but the Latte center is about 1/4 of what the ones in the can were. Must be cutting costs or somthing. Won't order again.,2
on the advice of friends i purchased this 2-pack.  everyone raves about how good it is and how it is a substitute for peanut butter.  i have to disagree.  it's like eating sweetened grease.<br />a side by side label comparison (using Skippy Natural PB) shows that the two are very similar except for protein and vitamin/mineral amounts but i much prefer peanut butter.  the flavor of this stuff is okay but just too greasy for me.  i think i could mix up brown sugar and butter and get the same effect.<br />so my vote is Yuck.,2
"The cats eat it.  After that, what I like best is the container, it is a plastic/metal tub with foil lid.  This means rather than a can opener or a loud opening tab lid on a can, this is quiet to open.  I can easily feed one or two cats without everyone running because they hear food.  This is important if you are giving medicine or special feedings.<br /><br />It is a nice pate texture with juice/gel around the outside. The texture and juice/gel is always consistent, not dry one time and liquid the next, always the same firm yet moist pate with the juice/gel around the outside. (juice/gel is just that, mostly juice but a bit of the gel like you see with meat).<br /><br />My cats like all the flavors.",5
"Wish I'd read the bad reviews before feeding this to my poor pup. She is a 4-year old, 25-lb. mutt and threw up a grand total of seven (7!) times after consuming one of these. Needless to say, we are not happy with the product. Will try to contact the company...I'm disappointed that I was able to buy these even after another reviewer said they'd be off the market a few months from OVER A YEAR AGO.",1
"I prepared this for my children for Christmas dinner. It was very popular. Please note that it can be sometimes a little dry, so you may want to add water or juice and sit for three minutes.",5
As you know finding a hot chocolate that taste great and is brewed on the keurig is a big challenge. Well this hot chocolate is quite good. The flavor is rich and the hot chocolate has some creaminess to it. I made it for my daughter and toped it off with whipped cream and she loved it.  Will be drinking lots of this on now that it is begining to get colder.,4
A the salt on the outside has broken off before packaging and the pretzels are hard enough to break a filling.  They do have a good taste though.,1
"Every can was dented, I was so disappointed. It looked like it was packed that way, not that they were damaged in the shipping.  I also feel that the pumpkin was a bit on the watery side, so not only will I not order this product through Amazon but I will not use this brand again.",2
"I have ordered Breakfast Blend over the last three years.  The last order I received through Amazon was just awful! Bitter, burnt, undrinkable.....what are they doing to my once favorite coffee??",1
"I wanted to like this item and had seen the generally favorable reviews.  I loaded it with some liver treats and opened our front door to offer it to my dog-- she grabbed the rope and released it...and it fell about two feet onto the step and cracked!  I was pretty surprised it took that little to break it.  The crack was on the screw-in bottom so it spread and basically the bottom broke and it was useless...back to Amazon, sorry!  Maybe a rubber guard for the bottom would make this a better product?",2
My dog loves these treats and they smell so good! I've tried three different stores and can't find them anywhere. Too bad no one from the Marketing Dept. reads these reviews; maybe they would start carrying them again. I'm very disappointed I can no longer buy these treats.,2
"I love the coffee, the price is great, but the product I received was not what was advertised.  In the 4 variety boxes there were NO Kona coffees.  The substitute was the Breakfast Blend.  This is not what I ordered.  I am very disappointed.",2
"I've tried the roasted orzo thing and all sorts of decaf coffees in my quest to eliminate caffiene from my life, and this chocolate mint herbal coffee is by far the most amazing thing I've tasted.  Its super smooth, no off tastes or aftertaste (except mild minty smoothness), and tastes so similar to coffee that I dont have to keep choking down the other subsititutes (I dont know what I'm going to do with the other 4lbs of roasted italian orzo I have).  After all the failures, I never thought I would actually find something that I could replace real coffee with, but by gosh I found it.  And just to make sure it tastes like coffee I gave my girlfriend a sip (she dislikes coffee) and she said that if it wasnt for that overwhelming coffee flavor, she loves the mint with a hint of chocolate... success!  I'm definately gonna try this out on some of my other hard core coffee drinking friends and family and see what they think.",5
Not very happy with these. They came from oriental trading I could have just ordered from them :( They break apart into pieces when trying to open and they just don't look all that appealing. Of course a child wouldn't care though but as a parent I didn't like them.,2
"All this is, is artificially sweetened hot cocoa mix that is placed in a Kcup delivery device.  What a waste of money.  Also, Grove Square products are notoriously inferior.",1
"This catnip comes on the twigs with the dried up buds attached. Most catnip, including Sojos, comes pretty finely ground.  This catnip they just clipped the stems and let them dry and then put the whole thing in the bag.<br /><br />My cat really likes it.",5
"I personally like pure teas, so that one I tried just few times. It was ok, nothing special. Did not taste like actual tea to me. However, my wife liked it.",4
This cookie is too hard to bite into and the center is like eating crispy sugar.  I did not care for these at all and now I have a whole case of them.  Guess they will end up as a pie crust or something.,2
"...I will drink this if all other coffee options are exhausted. The coffee has a vanilla/coconut smell but after a sip or two, I can't drink it. Would not purchase again and I'm having trouble even giving it away. I expected more from Wolfgang Puck.",1
"If you are wondering what size the contents are, it is like receiving a Theraflu packet. The foil cover that is in the description is again, like Theraflu where you cut the top of the `foil cover' off and pour the contents into a mug with water. I then warmed the mix and water; I used extra water and warmed it up in the microwave. On the back of the contents, it reads: For Hot Serving: Pour contents, add hot water (250ml) stir and serve immediately.<br /><br />Since it calls for 1 cup of water, I used almost twice as much since I do not like strong flavors. Even with two cups, ALL I could taste was the Ginger. Don't get me wrong, I love to eat ginger, but the flavor is so overpowering. It actually hurt my throat each time I sipped it. Not from the heat of the water, but the hotness of the spices. It states it has lemon to it; I could not taste lemon at all. I tried a few sips and it hurt my throat so much I had to stop. I know ginger is good for motion sickness, I have been suffering from extreme vertigo caused by a medical condition and did not feel the effect, however, I probably did not consume enough of it. I have drunk bad tasting stuff before but this is beyond bad, it actually hurts to drink. A drink should not be painful.<br /><br />After trying to get a few sips down I had a guest over and asked if they wanted to try my drink. They agreed and the word was ""awful!""<br /><br />I know drinks and flavors vary by person but I am surprised that anyone would drink this. I can also see why it aids in digestion by your body not wanting it to stay in your body and to get out.<br /><br />I liked that it was caffeine free but the taste was the worse ever. Even worse than medicines I HAVE to take and can't stand. To those who like and love it, more power to you. I will make sure not to buy again and hope there is plenty in stock for those who do praise it.<br /><br />Sadly, I cannot recommend this at all!",2
"I guess I should focus on the product more than the company, but I can't help it!  I started thinking it would be smart to buy bulk, whole spices online since it's cheaper and more efficient.  So, I noticed Whole Spice here on Amazon and decided to go with them!<br /><br />The nutmeg I purchased is great!  It arrived in less than one week, packaged very well, and the glass bottle the nutmeg is held in is clearly very thick and durable.  Not to mention, the label is even pretty - always a bonus!  :)<br /><br />The 1.1 oz bottle has about 8-10 nuts that were all a very good size.  I'm almost sure it could last me a lifetime.  So, the price of this product is obviously a good deal, and from experience, much cheaper than most grocery stores (including mega-stores, like Walmart.)",5
"Very pleasant tea but beware of the leftover foil on the top of the can. It's like a razor blade. Bad, bad design!",4
"First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats",2
"Purchased this same product from a different seller 3 months ago. The first product came in a box and was a bright green color, as matcha should be. This product that was shipped to me recently was listed as matcha, but was a dull olive green color, like fermented tea. It tasted terrible and did not mix well like the original matcha I purchased. Very disappointed. I used the same link to purchase the second batch, but a product from Taiwan was shipped and was completly different from the first.",1
"It's okay but it does not have a rich chocolatey taste. I actually find it to have a funky taste, can't quite figure it out.",3
"I'm sitting here, (Switch) drink in hand, trying to decide how to describe the Switch Kiwi Berry. It's lightly carbonated, which I like but too sweet for my taste (think strawberry candy). The mouth feel is quite round and it has some body too it. It's made from juice concentrates and carbonated water and there are 135 calories of sugar in the small 8 oz can. I wouldn't call it a healthy beverage and whether it's natural or not doesn't matter to me.",2
"Tastes good, attractive packaging. A little more pricey than the olive oil at Trader Joe's, but not a bad deal.",4
"After you add shipping, the cost for this product is over $7 a pound!  Even if you add in the gas needed to drive to your local store, you can find a better deal just about anywhere.",1
"I had read a few articles about Manuka honey, and it's supposed medicinal and therapeutic uses. I've had undiagnosed acid reflux for years now (perhaps it's something else?), and i've been battling it by drinking lots of water and trying to cut down on or eliminate the 'trigger foods' that bring it on. After about 2 days of use (3 teaspoons a day), I noticed my condition start to subside quite a bit! I would have never have believed it myself, but the Manuka honey was helping to quell my acid reflux events. This honey has a rather interesting taste, both sweet and a tiny bit 'medicinal' or bitter. The small hint of medicinal taste does not detract from the overall good taste though. The other great honey I discovered is Greek honey. To me, it is the best tasting honey in the world, and almost as effective for my acid reflux as the Manuka honey.",5
"I have ordered this jerky several times over the past few years, but never bothered to write a review because I was satisfied with the product.  Now that I have read the negative reviews, I am compelled to comment that I have been happy with all the orders.  I have sent them to my son, he loves this brand better than others, and has never complained it is dried out or tough.  It is beef jerky, it is supposed to be a little tough!  None of the packages have had quick expiration dates, it takes me a couple of months to go through 4 packages (whereas the son takes about a week, or less), first is as fresh as the last.  It is not too spicy, the flavor is meaty, the  pieces are not fatty, like some types I have purchased.  The amazon price beats anything in the grocery, and service is always prompt.",5
"I bought these expecting them to be like others I've had in the past. But what a sickening surprise! The chocolate coating is fine but the orange center is so tangy as to be almost lacking in sweetness entirely. My tongue could not take it! I contacted Jelly Belly only to be told I would have to send back the entire bag for a substitute product, as if, and at my own expense. Such a lack of customer service I've never encountered. I had to throw the whole bag out and vow to not deal with them again. Consider this a forewarning to be taken seriously.",1
"This one is a great basic food. Whatever is in it, cats really go for and mine is no exception.  My current cat really doesn't like the ground variety which is what this is.  He will eat it occasionally, so I only buy it about twice a year.  My previous cat had to have it more often and really enjoyed it.  It's hard to judge what a cat will eat so if your cat likes ground, give this one a go because it really seems to be a big favorite.",4
"I've subscribed to receive Pamela's GF cookie mix and after the second delivery of OLD mixes I am returning to buying them in the store.  All of the last mixes during the last several months (6 bags per order x 2 = 12) have been OLD -- not expired, but the chocolate is dried up, light brown and crumbles to a powder.  I discovered it's not possible to return a subscribe 'n save order (for some reason) so I have to throw out the chocolate chips and use Ghiradelli instead.  Whenever I have bought Pamela's from Whole Foods the chocolate in the mix has been dark brown, fresh and never has crumbled to powder.<br /><br />AVOID subscribe and save on this item.  Buy them in a store.",2
"I had to decrease my baby's feedings when I had to return to work 8 weeks postpartum. Eventually, my hectic schedule and numerous illnesses made me stop. My son is now 3 months and I have been feeling incredibly guilty about stopping, so I'm attempting to relactate. I only had about 2 drops of milk from each side, but after almost a week of Fenugreek (9 pills a day), I'm noticing more droplets and an occasional squirt. I find that incredibly impressive. Without this, and my pump, I would have given up and felt guilty for the rest of my life.",5
"I took the Via Taste Test at my local Starbucks. I was served a cup of Via and a cup of fresh brewed. I guessed correctly which was which, but I must say it was by no means obvious and I wasn't sure. This does not resemble any other instant coffee I have ever tasted in any way, shape or form whatsoever. This is the perfect substitute when you cannot brew your coffee, like when you are travelling and your hotel doesn't offer a coffee maker but has a microwave you can zap your water in. In fact, Starbucks Via instant tastes BETTER than the ""cheap"" fresh brewed brands, and if money isn't tight you may even want to use it when your room does have one of those coffee makers but with the cheap coffee. This is an excellent substitute when I don't have acess to my Keurig brewer and high quality coffee at home. And it takes only a minute to make.",5
Purchased these from starbucks on a whim as I was starving and figured I would give them a whirl. I am now on a subscription delivery from Amazon. This product is the best potato chip I have had. The only problem is you can finish the whole bag and then crack open the second and third and then that defeats the purpose of trying to eat a little healthier chip. Oh well. They are damn good.,4
"These nuts arrived promptly and packaged well.  Their taste isn't the same as the pine nuts I've purchased from Costco or from other stores.  I don't know if I would purchase them again because their taste was subdued in stuffing, cookies and salads even after toasting them in the oven for a little while.  They are also longer and thinner in shape than the pine nuts I am used to using.  Nonetheless, they worked in a pinch when I wasn't able to find them in my area.",3
"An entire bag of the 3-ounce Popchips are only 360 calories and are very low in fat. I can snack on this or even replace lunch with some of them. There is just the right amount of salt and, despite being produced very unlike traditional chips, the expected crunch is still present. The only complaint I have is that the material of the chip is actually fairly coarse and if you're eating them quickly, I find the roof of my mouth gets a little raw.",5
"These are good, but don't have as much of the ""gooey Jam"" center as some of the others I have tasted.  Brach's makes a very good strawberry candy, but I cannot always find that brand at my local stores, so this does pretty well.",3
"I have no complaint about the product itself. I likely would have rated it very good had it not been subjected excessive heat somewhere along, before it arrived. Although I ate them, each one was sticking to the wrapper and<br />difficult to eat without sticky deposits on my face and hands.",3
"I read about the taste of Skyline chili on a Tulsa, OK website [..], posted by someone trying to simulate the unique taste of cheese coneys made by the Tulsa, OK-based Coney Islander hot dog restaurant chain.<br /><br />A transplanted Tulsa native that's lived in New York City since 1977, I was suddenly overpowered by the urge to recreate the mythic hot dogs of my teenage youth, so I immediately ordered a case of six 15-ounce cans.<br /><br />Amazon promptly delivered the chili and I eagerly set about sampling it. Unfortunately the chili turned out to be (no disrespect intended to Skyline fans in Cincinnati and elsewhere) inedible--at least to my taste buds--and looking nothing like the product depicted on the can wrapper. The contents consisted of half watery soup, half highly spiced meat, and resembling nothing like the savory, meaty chili described by the website writer. Even after pouring off all the liquid, the remaining chili was so heavily spiced with I believe to be a heavy dose of cloves and perhaps some cinnamon and other ingredients that I stopped eating after a single bite.<br /><br />Still, wanting to believe that I could somehow employ this chili to help mimic the taste of my beloved Coney Islander cheese dogs, I asked my wife to sample the chili, who proclaimed it to be ""awful.""<br /><br />Much as I hate to step on a product that some people no doubt love, I have to say this is the absolute worst canned chili I've ever eaten. It was so bad I felt slightly nauseated a few minutes after having the single bite, and a faint worry about food poisoning briefly entered my mind.<br /><br />Needless to say, the five other cans were summarily tossed into the garbage. The quest to find the perfect chili for hot dogs continues...",1
"The fact that this has both HFCS and regular corn syrup, along with sugar is a bit disgusting. You can tell HFCS leaves a nasty film all over the inside of your mouth. Pretty much ruins it for me.",2
"The most delectable flavor I've ever experienced in a fruity green tea. I brew up large batches, keep in frig, and drink multiple cups each day. The green tea with matcha is very healthy. Needs no sugar. I choose to drink favorite teas and smell aromatic oils as ways to enjoy calorie-free pleasure.",5
"This is an easy review because the judgement was made by our two papillons.  They live for their treats and are NOT especially picky about treats.  These items are dried, uniform in size, and although they may be ""organic"" they smell bad and my dogs would have nothing to do with them.  I threw them out and wanted to share the expensive experience with others so they would not waste their money.",1
"well, here's what happens when you mix Handi-Snacks and Oreo - you get a snack that is actually pretty tasty and fun to eat!",4
"I've been a Zevia fan since it came on the market. The grape is the best flavor... it tastes like regular grape soda, not at all diet-like.",5
"I normally purchase the Lavazza Grand Crema pods for use with my Breville espresso machine, and have always been happy with them but wanted to try something different, so I ordered a box of Espressione Classic Espresso instead. Initially I was very disappointed with the results; a 30-second shot of espresso using these pods contained only about half as much liquid as one using my normal Lavazza pods (in other words, the water was passing through these pods at a much slower rate than through the Lavazza). Maybe my machine is lacking in pressure... but I could tell just by the feel of the pods that these are much more tightly packed than the Lavazza ones.<br /><br />My disappointment changed to delight when I tried these pods out on my Handpresso Wild, however. I had never really liked the taste of the Lavazza pods using this machine (seemed much more bitter compared to my ""real"" machine at home), but with Espressione it was perfect!<br /><br />Bottom line... if you are using a Handpresso, I recommend these pods 100%. If you are using a normal espresso machine, you may want to try out a smaller size package before committing to 150 pods.",4
"I read that the aero bar tasted similar to the choclite bar. Upon trying the aero bar I came to the conclusion that the chocolite bar is the better candy bar. Nothing comes close, I wish they would start making the chocolite bar again.I'm deeply saddend :(",2
"this coffee is smooth as silk, with a nice rich taste,great aroma, but not real bold or bitter,just a great cup of coffee!!!",4
"I grew up in New England.  We had Cake Mate sprinkles or jimmies.  They are made in Florida by Signature Foods. I still get them when I go back as they are in the grocery stores.  The CK ones are okay, and I thought they would be quite similar -- same bad hydrogenated oils and the reviews.  These are certainly fine for a cupcake.  But for ice cream or the occasional spoonful of sprinkles, you need the Cake Mate.  These are available in 32 oz. from spiceworld online.  They are listed on Amazon but not as currently available.  I plan to get some soon.",3
Have exclusively used this coffee for over 40 years. Since tha company was sold a few years ago the quality has progressively gotten worse. The cans are no longer filled firmly to the top. Now you can hardly taste the chicory. What a shame ! Now looking for another brand to replace French Market with.,2
"I did a fair amount of research before purchasing the Holy Jolokia sauce.  I selected this because it was pure Bhut Jolokia, not cut with Habaneros or other.  Given that the bhut jolokia is rated at 1,000,000 SHU, I was expecting some FIRE.  Tabasco sauce is up to 5,000 SHU.  Tabasco Habanero sauce is 7,000+.  This should be BLAZING.  Instead it is somewhere between original tabasco and tabasco habanero sauce.  Maybe 6,000 SHU.<br /><br />It has a mildly sweet flavor and a hint of orange and the heat hits differently, more on the tip of the tongue and the back of the throat.  The burn dissipates quickly and there's no real ""morning after"" problems.<br /><br />To be rather honest, I was expecting more.",3
"First of all, I am subscribed to receive two boxes of the variety pack every month. My cats LOVE the food and refuse to eat other canned food. I have tried to give them more expensive, better quality food but they only want Petite Cuisine.<br /><br />That said, I am quite disappointed at P.C.'s customer service. After researching on menadione, I emailed P.C. and asked if they plan to not use menadione in near future. I never heard back from them. Before this, I received an email from them with a coupon code. I tried to copy and paste the code on their web site and it didn't work. I emailed their CS and they told me that the coupon was working. Come to find out, they misspelled the coupon on the email. The code contained the word ""cuisine"" and they misspelled it. I emailed them back about it and they didn't responded nor sent out another email with the correction. Very disappointing indeed...<br /><br />In the future, if I find another brand that did not contain menadione and had better customer service, and I would instantly switch over to the new brand. Well, my cats have to like the new food too, which is why I haven't able to give them something else yet.",4
"I have to say I was disappointed in these cookies. For some reason the shape and packaging made me think they would be like homemade, soft and chewy. But they are crisp and dry, much more like a Famous-Amos style. The flavor is decent, but when you bite into one you are covered in crumbs because of how crisp they are.<br /><br />If you are looking for a soft, chewy gluten free cookie, I recommend the refrigerated dough from Immaculate Baking Company. I found them at Whole Foods and they're pretty darn close to the texture you would get with a gluten cookie.<br /><br />Again, there's really nothing wrong with these cookies, per se, they just weren't at all what I was looking for.",3
"My kids love this cereal, but I won't be buying it again. Or any other Kashi product.<br />Why? Kashi led us to believe that their ingredients were healthy. Then it was found out they were using GMO's. This was the exact thing that I thought I was avoiding by buying Kashi.",1
"I drink tea every day, and this is by far my favorite green. My favorite Japanese restaurant uses it, and I am going to buy a bag as soon as I can! The leaf pieces are relatively small, but they make such a sweet, irresistably grassy tea with the Matcha mixed in, I would rank this alongside whole-leaf teas in taste. Definitely give it a try if you like Japanese green tea. It also requires very little leaf at a time, so it will last.",5
"I too purchased this product thinking it might not be a flavored product, and before it arrived I looked it up to see that there was some rumor as to a coconut flavor.<br /><br />So, lets get this out of the way. *********Do Not Purchase this is you do not like flavored coffee. It is flavored.<br /><br />The first thing you notice is a deep coconut aroma, almost akin to Hazelnut in its presentation. The initial mouthfeel is good, a light roast but a snappiness to the roast which settles in nicely with the flavor, which<br />has a definite dark chocolate taste without the bitterness.<br /><br />The finish is semisweet chocolate, Jamaican coffee and faint toasted coconut.<br /><br />Bottom Line: if you like flavored coffee with coconut/hazelnut/cocoa profiles, you will like this coffee.",4
These things are So 'F'ing good!<br />And they were not even all mashed up.<br />Shipped quick. Fantastical product. you will not be disappointed,5
"I need to increase my nutritional intake due to a health condition.  It was suggested I put this on my popcorn to help boost my health. I toss it with some olive oil on my popcorn and treat myself to some Hawaiian sea salt too.  It isn't ""much"" but it makes me feel proactive in managing my health.  It is certainly an acquired taste.  It is helping me with my vitamin levels so I am pleased. It is a lot cheaper on so many levels than a visit to the clinic.",3
"It is nice tea for a low price. It has a slight sweet, light, and fruity taste but the quality isn't as high as I would expect from a green tea of this grade. In my opinion it's more akin to a Japanese Sencha than gyokuro. Although to be fair you can get this tea for bargain price. If you want a good gyokuro tea I recommend Teavana's Gyokuro (which i'm basing my opinion on)albeit it is about double the price for the same amount.",3
I keep buying this because my indoor kitty demands it when she feels like gravy and tender bits. All I can tell you is she eats it gravy first and is a HEALTHY HAPPY cat.I would buy anything for her but I am lucky when fancy feast makes her lick the bowl clean and is affordable :-),5
"I bought this as a cheaper alternative to New Tca Interactive Plastic Dog Toy Tornado Helps Prevent Boredom With Different Puzzles ... sometimes the off-brand toys are great, not in this case. The problem with this toy's setup is that all of the compartments are available at the same time. Two quick turns and the toy is completely empty. The ""game"" lasts for under 5 seconds for my ""special"" dog. To add further insult, its poorly made.<br /><br />I threw it away.",1
Got it for MUCH cheaper at my local independent pet shop. Make sure you call every pet shop in your county before you make your purchase online as the sellers here clearly are charging way to much for this product and trying to rip you off.,5
I changed jobs at work and my days of 90 minute lunches are over. Some days I am lucky to get 5 minutes. I now stock my drawers at work anytime I see decent food on sale at Amazon. These have come in handy more than once.,4
"I am a moderate drinker of both sodas and juices, so I was intrigued by the promise of The Switch.  I would receive the vitamin benefits of my juices with the fizzy fun of a soda.  The can is slim, so it fits nicely in my lunch bag but would rattle around in my car cup holder if I decided to take it as a to-go breakfast drink.  Once I had it all nice and chilled, I popped the top and listed to the fizz.  It was not quite the satisfying pop and fizz of a Coca-Cola, but that is because this drink has less carbonation.  When I took a sip, I was immediately transported back to grade school field trips where we were given bag lunches with juice boxes.  While it was a nice moment of nostalgia, the novelty quickly wore off.  The juice was nice, but I am not sure the carbonation really added anything to it.<br /><br />My biggest concern really deals more with the people who may not do their due diligence before deciding to purchase this product.  If you have a soda addiction, but you drink diet soda, this would be a calorie explosion.  While it is natural juice, you must remember that natural juice is high in sugar.  If you are accustomed to guzzling three or four sodas per day (or more) then you would not want to replace them with this beverage.  It must be approached with the same dietary caution as you would use with regular juice.  But if you have difficulty drinking juice or getting your recommended fruit servings each day, this might be a fun alternative.<br /><br />The price is high compared to soda, but it is low compared to some other individually bottled/canned juices.  I really liked the light kiwi/berry taste more than the black cherry.  I think that it makes a nice treat, but it is not going to be complete substitute for me.",4
These work perfect for quick lunches or a mid morning or afternoon snack. I usually use two packets at once for a lunch.,4
"Ditto. I am not impressed. This is an OK coffee, but no more than that, while, say, Davidoff Coffee that Amazon sells also, being much superior, excells in taste in quality... I am a Davidoff fan now. Never again, Mount Hagen! Get lost!",2
"I really enjoy Ahmad English tea #1, so I tried thier Earl Grey. It has an astringent aftertaste, is too strong, and this particular box has no individual packaging to seal the flavor in. I prefer not to use foil wrapped products for environmental reasons but these packets need to be in an airtight container so as not to loose thier flavor. I really cannot taste much bergamot which is what I enjoy about an Earl Grey. Also, it smells too perfumey for me. I'll stick to Twinings Earl Grey.",3
"This is not a typical K-Cup, this is a powder. If you are hunting for a new coffee, this is not it. Imagine those cheap bags of hot chocolate in a more expensive K-Cup, and that's essentially what this is. Got it for $9 and I still feel disappointed. Doesn't taste bad, but nothing impressive. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.",2
"I bought a case of this as part of my canned survival food storage. Needless to say it tastes awful and won't order anymore. I love molasses but for some reason I just can't stomach this. I was hoping it'd be a ""canned comfort food"" for a survival situation, but the only comfort would be not opening it in the first place.<br /><br />There's so many more options ouch there, canned bread is just not a good idea.",2
This is a real good product.I love these chips and so does my customers can't go wrong wit these the best,5
"My daughter loooooves pasta so when we started a gluten free casein free diet for her she was NOT happy about giving it up. She was picky even with wheat pasta, she would ask for some brands over others. She often likes it plain, so there's no hiding under sauce, either. We tried two other gluten free pastas and she wouldn't eat them (schar's and tinkyada). When she tasted this one she was absolutely thrilled. She said ""It's exactly like regular except it's on the diet!"" My husband said he would never have known that it was gluten free if he hadn't seen the package. It really tastes great, for any pasta, not just among the gluten free ones.",5
"I ordered mine a couple weeks ago when the price was $30 lower.  These aren't very well processed.  There are a lot of black seeds in them.  But the worst thing is the bitter seeds, which I discovered when I bit into one the very first serving.  I can't enjoy these as a nutty, crunchy additive to foods.  The only way I can use these is to mix some in a drink and swallow without chewing.  It's going to take a long, long time to use up 5 pounds when I use 1.5 Tbs each morning.  So far no rocks, but crossing my fingers.<br /><br />I need better glasses I think...I wrote the above copy this morning.  Tonight I poured a Tbs of the chia seeds into the lid and inspected it under bright light.  What I thought were black chia seeds are in fact rocks...lots and lots of rocks.  There is further contamination with a much smaller, perfectly round black seed (pigweed?)  I have written to the seller to request a refund.  I shudder to think what other contaminants I have consumed in the two weeks since I bought this product.",1

"First of, I didn't really know what to expect when I ordered this coffee.  Come to find out the ""single serve pods"" are flat, round cushions that require a special coffee maker.  I own a Keurig and Eco-Brew refillable cups that I really like, so I decided to open the pod and dump the grounds into the Eco-Brew cup instead.  It worked like a charm, and on the 6cc setting I got to enjoy a very bold brew with no aidic aftertaste.",4
"Good value to buy in bulk like this when the price is right. I buy black tea for making sweet iced tea. I'm not sure if it's just my batch or what, but I've made two batches now (16 tea bags) and the tea bags ""leak"" tea leaf bits. As soon as I opened the first package there were bits of black tea leaves all over. After I brewed the first batch there were bits of tea leaves in the pitcher. Quite a bit actually. Guess I have to buy one of those metal diffusers?",3

"They don't fill you up.<br /><br />My plan was, for lunch, to slowly eat one of these with a large glass of water. It's what my friend does with his nutrition bars.<br /><br />However, not only are these incredibly light, small, and I mean small, we're talking 3-4 bites, maybe 5-6 half-bites. Even if you chew 1-2 minutes(nearly impossible)<br /><br />They have a kind of sandy texture. Like you've just eaten caramel dipped in sand.<br /><br />The taste is alright, but I am disappointed. Triple Chocolate and I could not taste the chocolate. It barely tasted like anything...just had a kind of bland taste to it.<br /><br />At this price...I am disappointed massively. These were top rated by so many...<br /><br />But I think I will try the bar my friend has - his are 32g's of protein, 2.5x this ones, and only 30-40 more calories. Those are filling from what I've seen, have way more to them as well. Bigger, about 30% bigger size as well. To top it off? They are the same price and often on sale...they also have Vitamins and anti-oxidants.<br /><br />These, I don't know. If you down them with a Glass of Carnation instant breakfast, it goes well, kinda a good combo, not to heavy, just right. But this + water...not filling in the least.<br /><br />These are treats for after a meal, I suppose. I was looking for meal replacers. Ect, replace a breakfast here, or a lunch there. So I don't lose any muscle, just fat.<br /><br />I would recommend them if you want something very light to have as an after-snack to a small meal<br /><br />But these are not meal replacers. These do not go by themselves, you eat these + a meal. Just make sure you know that.<br /><br />It's my fault, I suppose for not researching.",3

"There are several things a coffee lover looks for in their brew.. the aroma, the color and the taste are what I look for. When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent.  The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine.  When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug's worth of water, and made a cup.  When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk.  Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee.  For the second cup, I used a smaller mug, and in return got a darker, more flavorful cup, so that is my recommendation with this brand.  Some other things I love about this brand:  it's organic, sustainably grown and Fair Trade certified. That's a lot of benefits for only about 75 cents a cup.  The even have their own foundation to support youth soccer programs.  This is a good deal.  The only thing that I would change is the individual wrap, which seems like an excess of packaging for a company dedicated to the environment.",4

"A friend of the family gave us some Bob's Red Mill whole flaxseed, and so I went looking for it on Amazon. Found this instead for a cheaper price--plus it's already ground for you! The product is fine, but the packaging is not; it's definitely not resealable. I must have tried thirty different times to seal that bag, and it wouldn't take. Thankfully we had some containers around to store it in, but it's rather inconvenient, especially with such a large quantity.",4
"I've tried both the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U49QU2"">Megafudge</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U43ZO0"">Chocofudge</a> versions of these cookies, and I'm writing a similar review for both.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the taste of these cookies.  The center chocolate fudge (which is soft enough to bite through easily, but not actually gooey) is quite tasty and the highlight of the cookie to me.  Chips Ahoy did a good job on that part.  The cakey portion of the cookies taste pretty good to me, too, but the texture isn't great.  They are kind of dry and just crumble apart.  So, not hard and crunchy, nor moist and soft.  More like dry and soft.  If you're like me, you're definitely going to want something to drink afterwards.<br /><br />I've tried the cookies at room temperature, warmed up in the microwave, and chilled in the refrigerator.  I like them chilled the best because the cookies didn't crumble apart in my mouth like they did otherwise.  Warmed up in the microwave, it wasn't much softer than room temperature...just harder to eat with some parts being uncomfortably hot.  Perhaps warmed in the oven would be better, but I haven't been inspired enough to heat up Chips Ahoy cookies in the oven, yet.  :)<br /><br />These things are bite sized and have 75 calories and 3.5g of fat each.  Not horrible for a cookie, for sure, but the taste isn't good enough to get me to pick these over something else.<br /><br />Given that the chocolate ""fudge"" is the main attraction to me, I liked the Megafudge version with the chocolate exterior better than the Chocofudge version because the chocolate flavor was much stronger.  Both are around 3.5 stars to me, but with the edge to Megafudge, I gave them a 4 and the Chocofudge a 3 here on Amazon.<br /><br />I'd definitely suggest getting a single bag at the local store to try these out before buying in bulk.  You might love these, but four bags is a whole lot of cookies if you don't.  ;)",4
"it was if god himself were in my mouth sitting on a lawn chair while drinking something really tasty and cool...it was as if a brinks truck had driven a billion dollars in unmarked bills from a bank heist that went sour into my mouth...it was like a thousand supermodels were bouncing naked on trampolines on my epiglottis...sort of like the beatles jimi hendrix and led zeppelin were singing the star spangled banner to my taste buds...like a unicorn making sweet love to my tongue{a girl unicorn of course}...it is the cure for disease, war, poverty, and pestilence not to mention hotdog finger...long live the lara bar",5

I have been looking for a ground organic espresso coffee in a dark roast that comes in bulk.  The problem is that this coffee is not ground fine enough to produce a strong coffee in an espresso maker.  It is fine for a french press or regular coffee pot.  So I am still looking.,1
Crumbly texture and they taste like they've been sweetened with stevia or some other artificial sweetener. I would definitely not buy these again.,2

"I thought this might would be a good, economical way to zazz up tap water or fizzy water. I like that it has vitamins & electrolytes, and that it has a lot of servings in a wee little package, making it very conveinient on fridge space. It was easy to dispense, includes a serving indicator on the side, and mixed in easily. But I found the flavor to be flat and synthetic tasting. I love diet coke, but that's about the limit to artifical sweeteners in my diet, so this might be a good choice if you drink a lot of artificially sweetened fruit drinks. However, if you only dabble in artifical sweeteners, you may find this bland, flat, and really fake tasting, like me.",2
Through email my vet advised me about a product recall on this food. Before I got the email I fed my dog this food and she became sick.

Here is the website to check the for the specific bags that were recalled. [...],1
"I prefer a full body roast of coffee similar to Starbucks HOUSE BLEND or Dark Varietals - NOT PIke Place which I despise. I find Dunkin Donuts way to lightly roased for me. When I was in NOLa, I had coffee at Community and it was a darker roast and full bodied. So I ordered this blend because it said ""Medium to dark"". When Opened the first bag there was no burst of coffee flavor. I've been making it and drinking it but it tastes like the satandard Dunkin' Donuts we use when it goes on sale for $4.99/bag.<br /><br />So it's not bad, but not special either and unless I catch a darker roast on sale, I'll probably not order it again.

"We have a 8 year old yellow lab. She has been eating this food fora  few years now. She eats the Chicken Meal & Brown rice variety.  The food is a good quality. We often have people comment that she is much younger than her actual age. She is trim (about 65 lbs) and is able to maintain a healthy weight.  We love having this food delivered from Amazon. It is much easier then lugging it home from the store. Even with pet store 'discount' member cards, the food is a better value at Amazon.",5

"My dogs refuse to eat the light green hard side of these treats. They do enjoy the soft dark green side, but they easily eat off that part and leave over the other side completely. The two sides aren't as 'together' as they look on the package, and it is super easy for my little dogs to pull off the soft side. I have never successfully been able to get either of my dogs to eat the whole thing, and I the other half is just completely wasted. These treats do smell really good, and might be good for a bigger dog that will just eat the whole thing instead of separating it. However, I would not recommend these treats as my dogs are NOT picky eaters and if they reject the light green hard side, I have a feeling most dogs won't like it. Considering the price, it just isn't worth it if the dogs will only eat half.",2
"I usually drink my coffee black, no cream, no sugar.  I tried this coffee that way and it was drinkable but too bitter for my taste to repeat the brew.  I'm sure it would be pretty good with a ton of sugar and whipped cream, which is how I will finish off the bag.  That makes it only useful as a desert coffee to me, not a daily drink.",3
"I love k-cups. They're pretty cool, and I like the idea of them, but I don't like sacrificing the flavor just for the sake of a cup. The tea tastes very watered down for some reason. And I am a tea drinker who doesn't add sugar/honey because I enjoy the natural sweetening properties in the actual herbs. But this herbal tea is missing something, especially with a name like 'Authentic Green Tea'. It's pretty disappointing for the price of these things, but I'll continue to drink it until I run out.",2
"The packets are extremely convenient and takes the guessing out of how much seasoning to use.  However, after eating the jerky, I developed a few sores in my mouth.  I emailed NESCO to get a list of the ingredients and there is MSG and sodium nitrate in the packets.

Like one of the other reviewers pointed out ""If you like hard and crunchy these are not for you"".",5
"When I coulnd't find Island Coconut K cups anywhere, I found this and decided to try it.  Although it is not exact, it is so close it puts a smile on face.  The coconut is not over powering, but you can taste the HINT of it certainly.  I love this and would order again and again...because THIS is available and Island coconut is not!!",4
It's not delicious but tastes better and healthier than other meal replacement bars. The cleansing effect is amazing probably because of fiber. I did replace my lunch with 2 bars and it worked great. I combine usually ReBar with Choco Raspberry bars from Garden Of Life :-),4

"Both of my finicky yorkies love this treat, but I don't!  It smells awful and I have to hold it for them to enjoy it, unlike other treats that I toss to them and let them enjoy while I enjoy a little peace and quiet.  Also, the liquid gets in their ""beard"" so the odor of the treat lingers even after I tuck the bottle back in the treat cupboard.  It is rare for both of my dogs to agree on a treat and it is fun to watch them enjoy it, but it is inconvenient.  I will not likely repurchase this.",3
"I've had quite a few sencha powders in my time.  The Stash product is one of the best-priced products out there.<br /><br />That said, what you get per packet is a bit on the light side for mixing with 16 oz of water.  I can barely taste the tea, and I'm pretty sensitive to tea flavors.  If you get this product, keep your mixes at 8 oz of water - otherwise, it's like you're drinking a flavorless algae.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a good product at a good price.  At proper concentrations, the flavor is good, and you can't beat the health benefits of a good sencha/green tea.",3
I thought I would try this stuff for my finicky dog who needs moist food along with his kibble.  He was not a big fan of it and it was the most expensive moist food at Petsmart.  The other problem is this stuff hardens up like concrete in his bowl. If he wouldn't eat the food in about two hours the stuff turned as hard as a sidewalk and I had to literally scrape it out of his bowl.,2

"I think illy coffee is really bold and smooth, and I've always liked these little pick-me-up cans. Rather than a similarly-sized Red Bull, this has just enough sugar and caffeine for just a little boost; in fact, less than what would probably be in a large iced coffee that I'd get for myself at a coffee place. I think the quality of coffee is also better than the comparable Starbucks cans.",4

So quality control is not being monitored and I'm going to call the company and<br />let them know that the last 4 boxes I've purchased are not up to par. They taste really<br />good as long as you don't bite into something hard. It's like biting into a nutshell<br />and they need to know this asap.,2

The reps at Lundberg act all shocked about anyone complaining about gluten reactions in their products---but trust me---there is plenty of evidence all over the web of people reacting to their products.  They need to step up to the plate and come clean about where the gluten is coming from.  GF is NO fad diet----it is life or death for some of us.,1

I'm almost always happy with my purchases from Amazon-- this is a rare exception.",1
"I am a confirmed tea addict, and I keep a wide selection of regular, flavored, and herbal teas on hand, so the chance to test a new flavor of herbal tea was a no-brainer.  I was more than pleasantly surprised to find that, though this is an entirely herbal concoction, it has the nice flavor of black tea.  I don't know how they did that.  There's a definite blackberry taste and the vanilla keeps all the other flavors calm and happy, but whereas some herbals have an overpowering single-flower note (usually some sort of citrus stomping heavily on the lighter flavors), there is no such thing going on in this cup.  Honestly, I would not have expected such a nice touch from Lipton.  I tend to be a little tea-snob, and I would have expected this from one of the exotic producers of primarily herbal blends.  My hat is off to Lipton for out-herbaling the best of the rest.<br /><br />Highly recommend this lovely, caffeine-free herbal for any time of the day or night when only tea will do.",5
"Yeah, the pkg says the Cocoa is Fair Trade Certified and it's made in Belgium and it has no trans fat and nothing artificial but it's first ingredient on its list is sugar and it has palm and/or canola oil.

"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1

"I am new to gluten-free and tried this mix out of convenience.  I've only made biscuits with it and I wasn't that impressed.  I had been using another one of Bob's gluten-free biscuit mixes and after a few months became disenchanted with the taste (and after-taste).  I was hoping this baking mix would taste different, but it was the same.  Still, a hot biscuit out of the oven with enough butter and honey to cover the garbanzo bean taste was sure nice after being off all gluten products!  It's worth a try as everyone's pallet is different, but this mix definitely has a distinct flavor.  I'm still searching for a good mix or might attempt to come up with my own.  It's definitely a process.",3
"Cats love this stuff. One pouch doesn't go far so it is more of a treat than a meal (unless you feed according to recommendations on box).<br /><br />Pouches are easy to open and a little messy, always seems to get on my fingers.<br /><br />My cats come running if they see me reach for the pouch or they hear the sound of flicking it back and forth before opening.<br /><br />All the yucky stuff (think fast food for cats) must be addicting because they seem to listen for the very quiet sound of the rustling pouch.  We give pouches as a treat.",5
"I wish Amazon would require any coffee with sweet artificial flavorings to be plainly identified as such.  Then folks who really dislike coffee adulterated this way could avoid getting another disappointing flavored cup of coffee.  This stuff tastes the way I imagine Newman's Own Extra Bold coffee would taste with curdled, spoiled Bailey's Irish Cream dumped in it - nasty.  Shudder!!!",1
Perhaps I should have known when I read caramel but I found this item too sweet for my tastes. Nor do I remember reading that it is an instant not a brew product. A lot like International Coffee without the ability to adjust the flavor.<br />Taking it off my S&S list.,3
"Wow, this stuff is nasty. I'm glad I only ordered one box. This coffee is so bitter and acidic. Everlasting, horrible aftertaste. Will not be buying this again. I'm a big fan of the extra bold k-cups my current favorite being Timothy's Midnight Magic.",1
"I read all of the reviews thinking these were EXCELLENT, bought a whole case...,I'm giving them all away except one.",3
"I have used this products for 6-7 years and always loved it, until today....I ordered this from Amazon and received it a few days ago. First I noticed a new label on the tub. OK, but then as I scooped out my first scoop I noticed a color change..instead of being the color of something like Nestle Quik powder my protein was a very light shade of tan...bad sign. Still, I gave it a chance..after mixing and tasting I felt duped! Different texture and WEAK flavor - where did my rich Cocoa flavor go? I could have picked this product out of a blind test after having it every day for that many years.... the new version is awful....did I just get a bad batch? HELP.",2
"I was hoping these would be a bit more exciting than they were. My son eats everything, but was fairly disinterested in these. I don't really blame him, I tried them myself and was underwhelmed with the flavor. Couldn't detect mango at all in the mango risotto! Organic ingredients are a huge plus though, so I'm glad they exist.",3
"These are the worst tasting BBQ Vienna sausages, no wonder the price was cheaper..<br />Recommend Armour only..sorry LIBBYs, this is not that great",1
"These crackers are so delicious! They have the texture of Ritz crackers, but even better flavor. The entire family loves them, even those not gluten-free!",5
"All the Pamela's Products are great. They taste good, have good texture, and most importantly they are easy to use. There are great directions on the package. There are wonderful recipes right on the package. And they are pretty easy to adapt to other recipes. There are tons of recipes created for Pamela's Products on the web on places [...].",5
"I'm always looking for a good source of fiber, Almond meal, coconut flour, any thing that gives me 3 g or more fiber, and this work horse is it, 6 big grams of it. I add it to pancake and or waffles, soups, breads, you just name it and it will fit right in.",4
"Having purchased Stonewall Kitchen Waffle mix and thoroughly enjoying the wonderful Belgian waffles, I decided to try Carbone's Golden mix.  When traveling, we have fixed ourselves waffles at the breakfast bar of Hampton Inn and learning that this is the mix used by that chain, I thought it was worth trying at home.  The price differential was a big factor in so doing, I must admit. Though a very satisfactory product, the flavor does not rise to the level of Stonewall Kitchen and my next purchase will be reverting to that product.",3
"(This review is for the white can with the gold star)<br /><br />I imagine if I were to break open a battery and empty the contents into my mouth, this is exactly how it would taste and feel. It's brutal. I can't really describe it. It tastes sort of... pineapple-y? With a hint of dirty socks and metal...?<br /><br />But it has a lot of good stuff in it and really wakes me up. But the blueberry flavor (blue and white can) is 100x better.<br /><br />If you want a sugar free energy drink, get the diet Red Bulls. I can hardly taste the difference with those. But these are okay sometimes and WAY cheaper.",3
"My main problem with this line of products is how thick both shampoos and conditioners are, to the extent that it's hard to squeeze them out of the bottle. As for other qualities, it's just ok for my hair. This conditioner just doesn't detangle my hair, which is supposed to be one of the primary purposes of a conditioner.",3
"Since visiting Costa Rica a couple years ago and touring Britt coffee farm, I have been hooked on Cafe Britt Poas coffee.  Volcanic soil is what makes this coffee so rich.  Excellent coffee and a great price from Amazon too.",5
"My local store frequently runs out of these. They are very tasty, and, wheat-gluten free. My ""Pack of 12"" shipping/handling is about $7.80 (30.8% of the item cost) to a major US Metro area. As I ordered two boxes which Amazon decided needed to come from two different distribution centers, I'm paying this rather high shipping/handling fee twice! Amazon does do groceries - but at what shipping and handling cost?",4
"I've had a Keuring brewer in one form or another for a few years now, and besides the sample packs, I must say these are the most disappointing K-kups yet.  Mabye I just like my coffee to taste like coffee, but this particular flavor has a very chemical taste to it, and leaves a pretty bad after taste. 1 star for working in my keurig, and one star for being cheap on Amazon.com!",2
"I've been a fan of Nong Shim spicy noodles for years, so when this instant version came along I had to try it. I love Korean style fat noodles and the fact that it's instant is a big plus. Unfortunately, it didn't taste as flavorful as their other lines and by comparison I find this version a little plain. No comments on the health factor since instant noodles by nature is junk food. But there's a time and place for them.",3
"I love this oil for salads and for light saute'. Has a distinct, slightly fruity flavor. Doesn't stand up to high heat though, so don't try to fry with it...",4
"I tasted these for the first time today...  I am not a picky person, but this bar caused me to gag and I needed to rub the excess of this bar off with a nearby napkin. It really reminded my of acidy vomit.",1
"I ususally buy Genisoy tortilla chips, but can't seem to locate them in-stock anywhere. So I decided to try the Kay's chips, because they are high protein also. They are good, but very pricey. I don't think I'll buy them again-  just didn't think they were worth the cost. I hope I can find the Genisoy chips soon.",3
"Seriously, it is so good!  Tea snobs that insist on using a decanter make me laugh.  ""Who uses tea bags?"", they say.  If you're feeling hip, you could go down to your local shopping mall, go inside a Teavana store, and spend over $100 bucks on a fancy teapot.  Or, you could just buy a stainless-steel electric water heater for $10 and this tea for under $20.  I drink at least 2 cups of the stuff at work.  While it's super easy to screw up a good cup of coffee, it's impossible to screw up a good cup of Stash Early Grey Black and Green!",5
"This tea is not ""minty"" enough. I have Stash Peppermint tea bags and they are so much stronger.",3
"My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term ""all about tuna fish"".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.  My conclusion is that it may be ok to give the cats fish as an occasional treat but not as a steady diet.",3
"They don't fill you up.<br /><br />My plan was, for lunch, to slowly eat one of these with a large glass of water. It's what my friend does with his nutrition bars.<br /><br />However, not only are these incredibly light, small, and I mean small, we're talking 3-4 bites, maybe 5-6 half-bites. Even if you chew 1-2 minutes(nearly impossible)<br /><br />They have a kind of sandy texture. Like you've just eaten caramel dipped in sand.<br /><br />The taste is alright, but I am disappointed. Triple Chocolate and I could not taste the chocolate. It barely tasted like anything...just had a kind of bland taste to it.<br /><br />At this price...I am disappointed massively. These were top rated by so many...<br /><br />But I think I will try the bar my friend has - his are 32g's of protein, 2.5x this ones, and only 30-40 more calories. Those are filling from what I've seen, have way more to them as well. Bigger, about 30% bigger size as well. To top it off? They are the same price and often on sale...they also have Vitamins and anti-oxidants.<br /><br />These, I don't know. If you down them with a Glass of Carnation instant breakfast, it goes well, kinda a good combo, not to heavy, just right. But this + water...not filling in the least.<br /><br />These are treats for after a meal, I suppose. I was looking for meal replacers. Ect, replace a breakfast here, or a lunch there. So I don't lose any muscle, just fat.<br /><br />I would recommend them if you want something very light to have as an after-snack to a small meal<br /><br />But these are not meal replacers. These do not go by themselves, you eat these + a meal. Just make sure you know that.<br /><br />It's my fault, I suppose for not researching.",3
"I wish I had a bit more to say about this product.  I used both this and the conditioner of the same line.  As a result, and with apology, my reviews for these products will be very similar.<br /><br />The scent of the shampoo is fine.  It's neither particularly outstanding nor is it bad.  The scent, such as it is, is not very long lasting.  The shampoo seemed to do a good job of cleaning my hair.<br /><br />After using it, I didn't notice any particular change in my hair.  It didn't seem stronger or shinier.  It's possible that I could see improvements with repeated use, but I've used other shampoos that give a fantastic result with the first wash.<br /><br />It simply seems to be a fine, basic shampoo and seems mild enough for everyday use.",3
I received all containers previously opened - all seals were opened. On the top of containers was decent pieces of liver and below that were grisley pieces and a lot of powder on the bottom. I will never buy liver treats from Amazon again. BIG RIP-OFF!,1
Cotton candy sugar packs were better than described and a great value.<br />They make perfect cotton candy and the containers hold much more product than I thought they would.<br />You only need a small amount to make the cotton candy and it is delicious!!!!!!!!<br />My daughter really wanted a cotton candy maker and I was a little hesitant but am extremely happy to have purchased these sugar flavor packs that work so well.<br />Would definitely recommend.,5
"I generally make all of LO's food organic from scratch (yes, I work full-time, but this is important to me, so I make the time).  However, I've tried a few pre-packaged foods...and while LO loves the taste of Chick Chick, and I like that it is more well-rounded than most others, I absolutely hate this packaging.  If my little one decides he doesn't want to finish the package after three bites, the rest is total waste...or I have to scoop it into a different container to store until he's ready to finish.<br />Absolutely love the item, but hate the packaging.",3
This granola is addictive! It is so refreshing and it is also organic.  I used it for cereal when the granola got to small and it tastes great!,5
"I have ordered this cake three times in the past 15 months. We love marzipan and this cake epitomizes great preparation, presentation and proportion of marzipan. We do not care for traditional fruitcake, but this cake is very different. It's abundance of delicious high-end fruits and moist cake make it taste out-of-the-ordinary. Try it, you will not be disappointed.<br />Amazon offers the most competitive pricing, when you order it directly from them, not a MarketPlace vendor. We found out that we have to watch our carbs (sugar, etc.) intake. so we don't order it as often as we would like.",5
"My dogs love these treats but with the Made in China label, I don't buy them anymore.  The AVMA and FDA has issued warnings related to chicken jerky treats made in China and my wonderful vet made me aware of this.  I'm very unhappy about this as my dogs really do love them.  But I love my dogs enough that I won't purchase these or other Made in China treats.  And let me tell you - that's a challenge.<br />Let me note that I did a search on Amazon for ""Dog treats made in USA"" and this product came up.  If it doesn't actually say in the description that product is ""Made in the USA"", it's not.",2
"My review is for the Triple Berry Crunch granola in the 12 oz bag.  I had not tried this particular flavor before but had tried the Fruit and Nut variety in a free sample.  I was looking online to purchase the Fruit and Nut and found the Triple Berry which had less fat and calories and so I bought that instead.  At Amazon's subscribe savings plus the current discount, the cost is less than $3 a bag which is great!  This product tastes great, has a great texture, and is great to take along in little zip loc bags for a snack.  My children ask for it and eat it by the handfull.  I've since gone back and ordered more of the other flavors of this granola.  The company has a website with all their nutrition information listed so you can check all that out and compare flavors in detail before you decide.  My only somewhat negative comment about this product is that I wish it had a few more berries in it (what couldn't use more berries??) and that it came in more of a cluster form so my toddlers could eat it a little easier.  We've not experienced any of the tasteless choke and gagging that others have mentioned, nor did I find the product to be overly priced as someone else had said.  In fact, we've found quite the opposite and will be stocking this product and other flavors of it on a regular basis.",5
"If you want a cereal that has lots of fiber and protein, and will keep you full for hours.... this is not that cereal.<br /><br />If you want a cereal that is just plain delicious, to be eaten for the pure joy of eating it.... this is not that cereal.<br /><br />If you want a cereal that tastes like stale kix rolled in the crumbs of some honey roasted peanuts, and is  satisfying in neither taste nor quality.... then this is the breakfast cereal for you.<br /><br />I think i've made myself clear.",1
"I read about the fat content on the Larabar site, which said: ""What about the fat in L&Auml;RABAR? Plant-based fats are healthier than animal fats. The fat in L&Auml;RABAR comes primarily from nuts-all plant-based fats containing Omega 3 & 6 essential fatty acids, which have been proven to reduce LDL cholesterol and help protect the heart.""  I read all the reviews before making this purchase and I was amazed at how misleading PEN PAL's, review was (they said: ""LARABARS HAVE 45 - 55 % FAT! 200 + CALORIES!"").  It sounded scary.<br /><br />Olive oil is good for you, but no matter what, the calories from fat (9 calories per gram) are going to be the same whether it is from bad sources of fat or good sources.  The calories from this product are from good sources and that is what counts.  Everybody who has gotten to the point of good intelligence regarding managing their intake of food should be aware how to use good fats vs bad fats, good carbs vs bad carbs but this IS, in my estimation, a very healthy product and just as you would not put too much olive oil on your food, or overeat nuts, you won't binge on Larabars or anything else you know will have unwanted consequences.  I'd give these delicious bars a try and fit them into your food management routine any way you see fit!  It definitely goes in the good food category for sure.  Don't hate the fat, hate the lack of discipline and they are a tempting yummy. :)",5
"I hate calling out an entire brand, but sadly, I must. I accidentally ordered this thinking it was a different, very similarly named brand, and didn't realize it I brewed a K-cup. It was so bitter, typical of this brand (this is my third attempt with this brand). And of course, I just had to accidentally buy the jumbo 24-count pack. Even with a 1/4 c of cream or a whole packet of hot cocoa, it still has a big bite to it. Anyway, it's just not for me. Good price, though, and arrived on time.",2
"Since this type of yeast is no longer available at any of our local grocery stores, we decided to load up on this find by purchasing (3) packs worth which ends up being (45) individual yeast packets.  Problem is they arrived on 4/13/11 and the yeast expiration date is July 2011!  When we were able to get this product in our local stores, the expiration was minimally a year or more.  Since these packs cost double what the stores charge, this is ridiculous.  I guess we'll be eating pizza for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the next 3 months before the yeast is useless!",1
This definitely satisfies you when you need a little something sweet. I find I don't even have to eat too much of me to be satisfied. The taste is great and best of all it doesn't cause upset stomach like many other sugar-free products do.,5
"Great ingredients. I am disappointed that one of my cats will not eat it.  My other cat, however, loves the Thanksgiving Day Dinner",3
Taste is very weak and didn't improve with coffee creamer. Sorry but this box is a dud. Wish I could return.,1
"I teach German and make funnel cakes with all my 6th grade students (about 175 each year.)  I used to do it the ""old fashioned"" way by covering the spout of a funnel with a finger and then pouring it. This was a MESS!  This pitcher makes it so much quicker, cleaner and easier!  I don't use the ring because it is pretty unnecessary in my opinion (plus it scratches non-stick Teflon off of pan.)  I also haven't yet used the mix because we make our own from scratch.  So I guess I'm just reviewing the pitcher, but it works GREAT!  Because the kids have more control over movement, they really can get creative with their cakes.<br /><br />The one con is that it is made of plastic, so I'm worried that one day I'll have a meltdown with either the bottom being set too close to the burner or the funnel tip going in the hot oil, but so far, so good.  This is great fun for everyone and my students LOVE it!<br /><br />A few tips:<br /><br />Add some cinnamon and almond extract--yum!<br />Flip using metal tongs--not a spatula--for less splatter and mess.<br />Plan to make several at a time--they are cheap to make, but the oil can be pricey.",4

"These Taffy cookies are similar in flavor to the Tea cookies.The Tea cookies have a nice sandwich cookie crumble and great flavor.These Taffy cookies were hard,dry,and unpleasant to eat.The expiration dates were fine-so is this just the way these cookies are,or did I get a bad batch?I will not be ordering again.",2
"These are great little cups of soup to throw in your bag for work and have for lunch.  However, everytime I have ordered from Amazon, one has become damaged during transit and spilled all over the rest during shipment.  I contacted Customer Service and they sent me another set, but the same thing happened!  Should probably just wait for them to go on sale at the grocery store!",2
"We love this Knudsen organic juice for the 2 year old. My only problem is that the box is too small. Even though she is so small 6 ounces would be a better portion size for her. Again, love the juice box and adore the 32 oz bottle size for when we are at home.",4
"I prefer dark chocolate, but this has a good taste. I'm happy with it, even though it is milk chocolate.",5
"This Taco Bell Chipotle sauce is quite tasty. I tried it in homemade burritos, and it was a great-tasting addition. It's a creamy sauce with just the right amount of spicy kick. It also works well just as a dip for tortilla chips.<br /><br />The downside - as with most creamy dressing-type condiments - is the amount of fat content. Two tablespoons of this sauce contain 110 calories, 100 of which are from fat. There are eleven grams of fat in each serving. A shot or two of this sauce once in awhile is fine. But the way some folks like to liberally douse their salads with dressing, this isn't the best choice for that kind of thing.<br /><br />But in moderation, this sauce is a great way to dress up your Mexican-style cooking. The flavor is distinct without being overpowering.",4
"I have enjoyed Moroccan food for many years and have recently received a tagine pot for Christmas.  As I started to build a Moroccan pantry I knew that there were a few item that were essential.  This included preserved lemons, Ras el Hanout spice blend and a Harissa paste.  I found this one on Amazon and even though it seemed a little pricey I ordered a couple of jars.  Here is my take on it:<br /><br />Zamouri's Harissa Chili Paste has an obvious red pepper flavor and is medium low to medium heat (depending on your taste).  Although the peppers are not identified on the label I am guessing New Mexican red and cayenne (this product is made in the US, by the way).  Still, the chilies are not overwhelming and several exotic flavors come through.  The first thing that I tasted was cumin although it is not specifically mentioned on the label.  Here are the listed ingredients:<br /><br />Fresh Chili Peppers, Crushed Red Peppers, Salt, Preserved Lemons, Garlic, Paprika, Olive Oil, Vinegar, Water, and other spices.<br /><br />I have to be honest and say that I am certain that when I visit a African grocery store I will be able to find a similar blend at a fraction of the price.  However, if that is not an option for you this blend is authentic and very, very flavorful.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CBT7TC"">Emile Henry Flame Top 2.6-Quart Tagine Red</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OUX2QA"">Ras El Hanout 4.0 Oz By Zamouri Spices</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1845979486"">Tagines & Couscous: Delicious Recipes for Moroccan One-pot Cooking</a>",4

I will no longer make purchases on items that I can try buying at the store first before investing in buying by bulk and saving online. Do not purchase these chips unless you already tried them before.",1
"Organic freeze-dried corn is a wonderful snack. I eat it instead of tortilla chips. Organic freeze dried corn tastes great and I usually eat it right out of the bag.<br /><br />Organic freeze dried corn has a light, airy texture that practically melts in your mouth. It has a fresh taste that reminds me of sweet corn right from the garden.<br /><br />Freeze-dried corn can also be added to your favorite recipes. And it will remain fresh when stored for long periods of time.<br /><br />But Sensible Foods Organic Sweet Corn, at several dollars for 0.75-Ounce, is way overpriced.<br /><br />Check out ""Organic Just Corn"" by a company called Just Tomatoes. Amazon sells it now. The product is just as good as this one and you get about 5 times as much for the price. The quality is as good or better IMO.<br /><br />Another option is Now Food Non-GMO Freeze Dried Corn -- but that is not organic. It tastes great, but I prefer organic.",2

"just to be SURE these were REALLY REALLY CLEAN, i washed a couple of hundred grams very carefully for about ten minutes and then let them dry, and compared them to the same seeds out of the same package without my personal treatment.  they are exactly the same color and consistency, so i would judge that the frontier seeds straight out of the bag do not have any RESIDUE on the exterior of the seed.  lovely, nice, sweet, nutty taste, chock full of serious nutrition (good-for-ya oils and such, pretty sure these are an omega source among other things).  not great for drinks but with baking, i'd go for it.  i snacked on a few after i washed them, as well as drinking the water to be sure it was clean and flavorless, as i expected.  wonderful crunchy stuff.<br /><br />since i'm a little obsessive about getting for the best and freshest quality i can get, i did buy some special somiverum seeds strictly to start my own garden.

I love tea and herbal tea. I have ordered Davidson's 1-pound organic chamomile tea from Amazon numerous times now. This is the first time I have order from Tao of Tea and only did so because Davidson's did not have it available on here at this time. I will not order Tao of Tea again. I received my product and it seemed stale and was nothing but shake. When you get Chamomile tea it should be flowers not shake. Every time I have ordered Davidson's chamomile it has been wonderful. I would suggest you pass on this brand and get Davidson's if it is available. I believe it is even a little bit cheaper too from Davidson's which is an added bonus. I am not impressed with Tao of Tea.,2
"These raisins are good quality and the price is excellent.  I bake a LOT of raisin bread - several loaves per week - and was pleased to find an organic bulk product at this price-point.  I am torn about the addition of sunflower oil to prevent clumping.  I would find this a little gross if the raisins were going to be eaten out of hand, but have to admit that for my purpose, the oil is a benefit - I don't have to spend 5 minutes breaking up clumps of raisins before adding them to the dough.  The raisins will seem a little small if you are used to conventional raisins, but if you're familiar with natural, organic fruit, you'll be pleased with the quality.",4
I was a little disapointed in this one.  It really lacked in flavor and was a very weak coffee.  I could barely taste the pumpkin spice flavor.  I would not recommend this perticular brand of pumpkin spice if you are a fan of the flavor as I am.,2

Maybe I need a new technique to use, but I didn't want to use it like a conditioner like many do because it is suppose to clean your hair.  So we will see.",3
"Background:  I am a big fan of Trader Joe's coffee.  We have a Bunn Coffee Maker with the slow sprayhead and a Capresso Burr Grinder.  So, I guess you could say that my husband and I really like our coffee.  I usually use a combo of The Joe's coffee at TJ's and the decaf Columbian.  I do make it strong--I just realized how strong when I googled it a moment ago.<br /><br />This Coffee:  I used 1 Tbsp per 5-7 oz. cup.  I couldn't find the directions on the package as some people did--it must have been in small print.  It was like mud.  Way too strong.  Even so, I didn't like the flavor of the coffee.

I thought it would take the family a while to go through them but we have already gone through 4 bags.  When my parents babysit it is the first item they take out of the cabinets to snack on while reading.  Great product at an amazing price.",5
"I used this product with chicken, Bell peppers, broccoli, mushrooms and zucchini squash. Saut&eacute; the mixture and to this add the sauce and coconut milk which comes in two separate pouches. First mix them together and heat it to gentle boil and then add to the cooked chicken and veggies. Serve with rice or pita bread. You could also use this with just vegetables, if you are vegetarian. I found this stuff to be too sweet for a curry. Generally I prefer Indian curries but I recommend this product if you like mild curries.<br /><br />1. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V17MLS"">Kitchens of India Paste for Butter Chicken Curry, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br />2. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SKT5Z0"">Sukhi's Gourmet Indian Foods Gluten-Free Classic Indian Curry Sauce, 3-Ounce Packets  (Pack of 6)</a><br />3. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J4GKZG"">Patak's Rogan Josh Curry Sauce 283g</a>",2
These are too hard and brittle (almost hurt my teeth trying to bite into them). We got them for our office and everyone had the same opinion. We have a stack of these boxes lying around now since nobody wants to eat them.,2
"My wife and I found these to taste very much like a Margarita however, when mixed as directed, the flavor is a bit watery.<br /><br />We were excited to try this ""mocktail"" mix thanks to the very low calorie count.  After her first sip, my wife described the taste as ""spot on"".  We're hoping that by adjusting the mixture (using a little less water), we can get the flavor to be a bit more potent.  I'll update this review after we've done that experiment (and possibly adjust my rating).<br /><br />Another thing we plan on trying is figuring out if there is a way to mix this with tequila.  We've used Baja Bob's sugar free drink mixes in the past (they are great) but the ability to have a powdered mix makes us feel they will store better.  We're not frequent drinkers so that would be nice for us.",3
I tried this on the advice of a friend.  Found this to be way too salty.  I added more water and it improved a little.  Will not buy this product again.,1
"Just in case, if anyone doesn't know what WHITE tea is, as opposed to green or black, let's quote Wikipedia: ""white tea is fast-dried, while green tea is roasted in an oven or pan (while kept moving for even curing). Oolong and black teas are fermented before curing."" What does it mean? For me, it translates into my favorite beverage to start the day with and to keep me going through the day. Objectively and scientifically speaking, white tea is said to have more anti-oxidants and less caffeine so, in my view, it's overall better than coffee or the black or green varieties.<br /><br />This particular product, while it comes in tea bags, it's not exactly your 'supermarket' variety. Unlike the cheap teas, black, green, herbal or white that are delivered crushed inside paper bags, the 'Choice' brand is delivered in pyramid shaped, biodegradable, nylon-like bags that ensure that what you get is actual leaves, not some indistinct crushed powder.<br /><br />This being a white tea, 'delicate' and 'subtle' and the required adjectives to use but they may not apply in this case. I found the added flowers to be a little too strong, bordering to overpowering for my taste. The Lychee and Osmanthus aromas can be an acquired taste - think of sweet, green apples for an equivalent more familiar aroma. If it's not 'love at the first sip', give it some time and you may not only tolerate it but prefer it to other flavors. Or not.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />- organic, fair trade certified White Tea<br />- natural Lychee flavor<br />- organic Osmanthus flavor<br />- contains caffeine<br /><br />The somewhat off-balance added flavors and the premium price are not likely to turn me into a repeat customer. Time will tell but at this time 3 stars (meaning 'it's Okay') seem to be the fair rating.",3
"This stuff is incredible. I had been using almond oil, jojoba oil, all different kinds of body lotions, and castor/olive oil. NONE came close to being as brilliant as coconut oil!<br /><br />About me:<br /><br />*I am 20 yrs old, white/half-russian. My skin is acne-prone and a BIT on the dry-side. My skin doesn't tan or burn easily, and I am obsessed with anti-aging (I want to write a book on what worked and what didn't when I am older :D). I live in California, so the weather is rather neutral year-round.<br /><br />*What coconut oil has done for me:<br /><br />Coconut oil smells sooo nice and has a great texture -- depending on the weather it is either creamy and solid or silky and liquid. Being as affordable as it is, I can smear this all-over my body after showers and it will absorb within 30 minutes to an hour. My skin feels sooo soft and hydrated afterwards and it even helps my sunless tanners last longer! This stuff made my skin so soft that one day I wore cotton shorts from Hollister (so you can imagine, slightly baggy). It was a hot day, and after walking around outside for only around 45 minutes my upper thighs/bikini line were KILLING ME. When I went home I noticed the first layer of skin had rubbed off because it was SO soft!!! This was a bit annoying, so I cut-down on the amount of coconut oil I use...but that was like *Wow*<br />Also, my boyfriend constantly tells me how soft my skin is when I am using it *waiting for three more to arrive tomorrow!*<br /><br />Coconut oil is the best moisturizer EVER! I absolutely love this stuff and will continue using it forever! I still use castor oil every few weeks just for the healing properties (I think) and for my eyes/teeth/gums, but this stuff is sooo nice for my skin (and hair in small portions)!<br /><br />If you want a moisturizer that FINALLY gives the results you want, THIS IS IT!!! Five stars! :D",5
Wow! I've been buying dog treats for over 40 years and this one takes the cake! Pay no attention to the photo in the advertisement for this product. What you get is two (2) small chews in each of three (3) shrink wrapped over cardboard packages. That's a total of six (6) small chews for $30.00 not including shipping! I couldn't return my order quick enough.,1
Not the best rice ever but pretty good.  Have not seen it in any stores around my area so I would probably order this again.,4
"I read some glowing reviews on blogs of these bars and decided to try this one as it was considered the ""best tasting"" by many.<br /><br />The outer chocolatre itself is good, but the ""caramel truffle"" had a quite unpleasant taste that I did not like at all. After two bites it ended in the garbage. Oh well...<br /><br />For now I'll stick to Lindt 85% Cacao bars which are cheap and meet my needs of a very low sugar chocolate treat.",2
"My Bichons love the food.  And, the price cannot be beat.  But, when I previously wrote about a can that came without a label, I never heard back.  I have also had a problem with dented cans.  Of course, if air gets into the cans, the food will not be safe to eat.  Makes me wonder if they are selling ""seconds.""  Would account for the great price.  Would have liked to have heard back from them.",3
"I got the 1 pound french vanilla flavor. I haven't tried a lot of protein powders but the few that I have had either a very grainy texture, were chalky or just plain unpleasant. Not this powder though. I mixed mine with cold milk and threw it in the bottle shaker. It dissolved easily, no clumps or grainy texture. It tasted like a vanilla milkshake and along the same lines for consistency. There were no hardships trying to choke it down with big gulps.<br /><br />The reason why I gave it four stars instead of 5 is because after I finished it up, it eventually made my stomach hurt a little from the sweetness. But I have a sensitive stomach so it will take a few more shakes before I'm used to it. I might try the unflavored next time but I'll wait and see what my reaction is after I've finished the whole pound. This will definitely be a second time purchase though.",4
"Great price and tasting coffee. Not as burned as all the Starbucks choices, and easily enjoyable. Using it in a DeLonghi espresso machine.",4
"the food itself is very good, but when I got the package, there were 2 cans broken on the bottom, sauce is out everywhere, the smell is very bad. even there is label - ready to ship.<br /><br />not sure if this is damaged during the shipping or before the shipping...",1
"Not bad, lacking in spice and flavor. Would suggest adding some of your own asian spices. Also the noodles take a long time to soften.",3
One of my co-workers that prepares meals for my shift said good greens don't come in a can. At my request she heated up a can of these seasoned greens and was very surprised. Good greens do come in a can! Now there's no reason not to have some around. Fresh in the can makes them a lot less work than the old fashioned way.,4
"This is a nice-tasting ""granola"" product, and it's on the crunchier end of granola products that I've tried. Though it has a strange finish in the taste, that's more obvious in this flavor than the other. I think that must be the flax seeds, which I'm not used to. But that's part of what makes this snack so healthy. It is hard to believe they packed 750mg of omega-3's into 1/3 cup serving. That's pretty impressive. I thought I would prefer this flavor, but I actually preferred the vanilla blueberry, it seemed to work better with the flax seeds.<br /><br />The product is great as a standalone snack, but it didn't do so hot in my soy milk. Think the cinnamon clashed or something. Probably do fine in regular dairy milk. The crunchy texture holds up well to liquids. The other flavor was fine in the soy milk. Both flavors went well in my coconut-milk-based yogurt.",4
I ORDERED THIS CHEESECAKE FOR MY BROTHER FOR HIS BIRTHDAY...IT ARRIVED ON HIS BIRTHDAY AND HE REALLY ENJOYED ALL OF THE DIFFERENT FLAVORS...HE SAID IT WAS A GOOD BIRTHDAY...CHEESECAKE AND PUPPIES...HIS DOG HAD PUPS...LOL...IM GONNA SEND THIS TO HIM AGAIN AND ALSO TO MY OTHER SIBLINGS AND MYSELF AS WELL...YUM...,5
Really inedible. So salty and just tastes awful. Disappointed to find it was ineligible for return...now they're very expensive dog treats.,1
"Pros:<br />- Blown away from the intensive taste compared to Lipton brands<br />- Great smell<br />- Leafs are relatively large so they do not fall through and end up in your tea.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- STAINS anything and everything<br /><br />I never tried this type of tea, but WOW.  When you brew this tea my fiance and I actually said ""WHOA!"" out loud.  The leafs are perfect size and makes brewing it very easy.<br /><br />IMO I would classify this tea as a winter tea as when I drink it I just wish snow was falling and I am drinking my tea to warm up. :)<br /><br />I cant give it 5 star mainly because of how fast and dark this tea stains our cups.  You have to make sure you clean your cups right away or else this tea will stain, A LOT.  I accidentally spilled some tea on our floor, and it actually stained the floor :(  Of course this would be considered User Error and the draw back of using an actual organic good tea, but now I have to make sure I can find the cups that have already been stained so I dont stain any more.<br /><br />Overall: Get it. I will make sure I always have one in the house.",4
"These chips are really tasty for being healthy.  The whole brand of chips is good, I have my family hooked on them, but being a gluten free vegan this is the only kind I can eat now, but its so good I don't feel like I am missing out",5
This sea salt has a great taste however the salt comes moist because its that natural from the sea ... This moistness threw me off and im disappointed that its difficult to use in a salt grinder.,3
"This was a weird drink - I had high expectations, but the flavor was just odd - it really did taste like fizzy Tang drink mix.  However, my kids really liked it, and I think it is a great alternative to junky soda, so I will most likely buy more - but not for ME to drink.  ;)",3
"All of the Happy Baby Stage 2 Foods I have ordered have had an excellent flavor, but the puree is a very watery consistency that requires me to mix in cereal just so it holds onto the spoon long enough to make it to my daughters mouth. If your baby is past basic introductions where you water it down to a soupy consistency I would try another brand or the next stage or two up. Very disappointed because the flavor is great.",3
"I specifically ordered these chips because the nutrition information states they have 4 grams of fiber per serving. They taste good, so I ordered the case from Amazon. (In fact, I even signed up for subscribe and save) When my package arrived today, the bag says they only have 1 gram of fiber per serving! I called Garden of Eatin' and was told that there was new analysis and testing done which shows they only actually have one gram of fiber per serving. That's a huge difference! The customer service rep said the testing was done in September, yet the nutrition information on their own website still shows 4 grams of fiber. To me, that is false advertising. How hard is it to go in change that information on your own website!<br /><br />So, bottom line, if you don't care about the amount of fiber...these are really tasty chips. But if the amount of fiber is what attracted you to them, don't buy!",1
"I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. THE CHEESE PRODUCT DOESN'T TASTE LIKE CHEESE AT ALL(SOME PROCESSED CHEESE DOES HAVE A CHEESY TASTE)AND THE BROCOLLI BITS TASTE WEIRD.  I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN VERY SURPRISED BECAUSE WHAT BROCCOLI AND CHEESE COMES IN A BOX? BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE THE SEASONING AND PASTA WOULD BE TASTY ENOUGH TO PULL IT OFF.  IT WAS A QUICK MEAL TO PREPARE SO FOR THOSE IN A TIME CRUNCH IT MAY FIT THE BILL SINCE IT ALL COMES IN ONE BOX.<br />I DON'T THINK IT OFFERS A GREAT ALTERNATIVE TO JUST BUYING SOME BROCCOLI IN A STEAMER BAG, PASTA AND A BAG OF SHREDDED CHEESE TO ADD TO YOUR  CHICKEN WITH A LITTLE SEASONING.<br />IF YOU'RE IN A PINCH IT MAY DO BUT OVERALL I WOULD HAVE TO PASS.",2
I tried Licorice spice at a B and B in Maine and absolutely loved it.  I can't always find it at a kitchen or grocery store so Amazon came to my rescue.  I now purchase a case at a time.  The clove and licorice flavors are wonderful and very soothing.  Very nice to have at Christmas time!,5
"My son loves these things (he's two) and they're always out of stock at the supermarket.  So, for Christmas we got him the big pack.  I'm pretty sure we'll by buying this pack again, because he loves them so much he's eaten a bunch already.  They arrived in great shape in a big cardboard box.<br />Personally, I don't like the taste too much - I would rather have cheetos - but these are much better nutritionally and my son loves them.  Home run.",5
"These cookies are always my favorite. They taste just like Famous Amos cookies! However, when I ordered them from amazon every other bag was stale even within the expiration date the taste was not the same. I was super dissapointed and it even prevented me from ever buying these again.",3
Thought this sounded like a great idea for my two little dogs....In fact such a good idea I purchased two packages--one for each dog. No way would my dogs touch them.  I even tried soaking in beef broth.  All attempts in vain. They would not try. A bad idea for this household.,1
"Last night I tried this product according to the instructions.  My oven was at the right temperature, and I baked for just over 12 minutes (around 157 degrees according to my tests).  And I tried it with some center-cut pork chops with the bone in, which should have made the resulting dish better than if I'd chosen plain old no-bone pork chops, but 100% of the three people who consumed these chops agreed they would have preferred them with no coating at all.<br /><br />One person said that the one part of her chop that I missed coating with the product on one side was the single best bite she took.  Another tester said she wished I had merely seared the two surfaces of the chops and left off the coating altogether.<br /><br />I myself appreciated the crunch of this coating, but every bite had an off flavor that I would prefer had not been there.  I too would have preferred no coating at all to the coating this product added to the pork chops.<br /><br />In case you're interested, here's the ingredients list.  ENRICHED WHEAT FLOUR (WHEAT FLOUR, NIACIN, IRON, THIAMIN MONONITRATE (VITAMIN B1), RIBOFLAVIN (VITAMIN B2), FOLIC ACID), SALT, CANOLA OIL, SUGAR, SPICE, CONTAINS LESS THAN 2% OF CARAMEL COLOR, DRIED ONIONS, DEXTROSE, YEAST, EXTRACTIVES OF PAPRIKA, ASCORBIC ACID.  I think you can whip up a reasonable substitute -- except for the caramel color -- by mixing flour and ground corn meal with salt and paprika, and I'd add some pepper if I were you unless you don't want me to.<br /><br />Why shake?<br /><br />Also, I'm not sure why you should bother to put the coating and the chops into a zip-top bag and shake them, especially since you must supply the bag, and especially especially since you must discard it immediately since it's coated in raw pork ick and which also adds maybe 15 cents to the price of the product.  Why can't you just dump the 2.25 ounces of coating onto a plate and dredge?  I get the bake part of Shake 'N Bake, but I don't get the shake part.<br /><br />The package says to buy four to six half-inch-thick pork chops, and I bought one for each of us three diners plus one extra for a total of -- just a moment while I whip out my spreadsheet here -- four.  As you can see from the photograph I've thoughtfully added, they were pretty big chops, and there was not nearly enough coating to have done the last one, not to mention a fifth and sixth.<br /><br />This morning for breakfast I fried the emergency backup pork chop in a little butter but obviously with no coating, and it was much more agreeable than the coated one last night.<br /><br />As a result, I conclude that this product needs improvement, and I rate it two stars.  I'd rate it one star, but that means that I literally hate it, which is a bit strong.  I just have no immediate or even long-term plans to use it again.<br /><br />In case you were wondering, as I can attest from having run the experiments for you, this product does not improve the flavor or texture of tapioca, a mocha latte, or vanilla ice cream (or probably any other flavor, but vanilla was all we had).<br /><br />-- Update: I don't see where we reviewers can add photos to the product page, so I take back what I said above about ""the photograph I've thoughtfully added.""  Maybe later.<br /><br />-- Update of August 8, 2011: I've now been able to add the photo, so please stop emailing me asking when the heck I'm going to get it posted.",2
"While this is a good way to add some flavor to water, it is definitely a fake/chemical lemonade taste.  I'll finish the container, but I'm going back to Crystal Light once it's out.",3

"The rice flour in it is a crude gritty grade (cheap?). If you've ever used Thai rice flour <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EYC096"">Thai Rice Flour - 16 oz</a>, you know that rice flour does not need to be this unpleasantly gritty.<br /><br />I tried compensating for the grit by using Bisquick Gluten Free to make Johnny cakes since the cornmeal is sort of gritty. But sadly, after you chew you are still left with this unpleasant grit like fine sand in your mouth.",2
"For out-of-the-boxed, processed-food quick skillet dinners, this one was pretty good! I don't know how they artificially simulated things like the taste of pickles, mustard, and onions, but this definitely tastes like cheeseburger. Sure, it's not healthy, but it's not terrible either (use lean beef). These boxed one-skillet dinners are designed for convenience, but often they're either overly salty or just bland. This strikes a good flavor balance.<br /><br />I fed this to my kids, and they both ate their servings and asked for seconds. And considering that one of them is a picky eater, and the other is 3 1/2 and so rarely finishes a serving of ANYTHING, that's a glowing endorsement.",4
"I was very disappointed with this item. Although it arrived before the 'best by' date on carton, the fortune cookies were very stale. This was the first time I had bought food from this site and it will be the last.",1
"This comes with the water it was boiled on.  I drained the water immediately after opening it.  The peanuts are soaked and saturated in brown water, the same natural color when you boil your own peanuts.  It is not a re-closeable pouch so you would need to transfer the content if you cannot finish it in one sitting.<br /><br />Too salty.  I don't know if it is as a preservative, but it is a bit much.<br /><br />The big W store sells this for three bucks a pouch.",3
"I might be a bit partial in my judgment of the taste of this soup, because I have made it homemade before. I didn't care for the flavor of the soup. Even after adding a little sea salt it still did not have the right flavor. It had what seemed to be an almost tomato soup flavor. I particularly did not care for it, but everyone has different taste buds. This is just my opinion.",2
"I drank Numi Gunpowder Green about 4 years ago and fell in love with it. Because of the high cost I decided to cut back and try other high quality, less expensive teas. I recently was in the grocery and saw Numi gunpowder green and decided to check it out again. I ordered three boxes of it and upon making my first cup I instantly thought ""this stuff has drastically changed"" It is so light in flavor that it seriously is like green water. I don't know what happened to the original Numi gunpowder green, but it needs to come back!",1
"I purchased this for my three cats, as a way to deal with hairballs and add some vitamins to their diet.  All of them are generally healthy, but this was recommended.  I'm really sorry that I spent the money.<br /><br />I followed the instructions, adding a small amount to their food for two days.  They did eat it; something that surprised me.  Usually they don't like anything different with their food.<br /><br />By the middle of the second day all three of the kitties were spending the majority of their time sleeping and trying to find dark places to hide.  They only do this when they are not feeling well.<br /><br />I stopped using the supplement and within another two days they were back to normal.  My cats are not overly sensitive, but this product really affected them badly.  I strongly suggest you use caution before adding this to your cat's diet.",1
"I admit that I am not a big dark chocolate fan. I first noticed that the chocolate does not have that sharp bitter taste that most dark chocolate has. Then again, it doesn't really have any taste. By the time I was done eating the chocolate bar, I kind of felt like I ate some wax. From there it did not agree with my system. It might be organic and dark chocolate, but give me a Hershey's bar any day.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence book and DVD series.",1
"After trying Big Train, Mystic and Enchanted Chai, I have found that Pacific is my least favorite. It has a different flavor in it that I do not care for.",2

"I bought these for my 3 month-old lab. I also bought some other treats (dehydrated liver, Kong biscuits, bully sticks). 1-2 days after feeding these to my lab she got violently ill -- vomiting and diarrhea. Took her to the vet and after an overnight stay and IV fluids, the vet had no idea what it was. They decided to x-ray her to see if something was blocking her intestines. Nothing. After antibiotics and rest she was back to her normal high energetic self. I gave her more of these sweet potato fries about a week after her first sickness episode.... and 24 hrs later she was vomiting again.  I was worried, but figured that it must be something I was feeding her. I then examined the package and saw these are made in China.  I threw them out and my puppy has been fine since. Logic points to these treats.... I will no longer buy food items for my dog from China. Nobody else has posted anything about ill reactions to these treats, but search around, lots of dog treats from China are making our dogs sick.",1
tastes pretty close to the real thing..unfortunately the ones i ordered came in a little stale. ive ordered them from gluten-free website before and they tasted fresher.,4
"These packets are really convenient and easy for kids to make themselves.  I didn't realize before I ordered it, though, that they contain a sugar substitute - which I always try to avoid in products my kids ingest.  That's why only 4 stars.  Other than that, they're great!",4
I find the crisps dissolve in your mouth and aren't especially filling.  It's pretty tasty and an unbelievable 40 calories per pack.  But I think I'll stick to regular apples as more filling and tastier.,2
"First of all the seller is great. Prompt shipping and quality packaging. I bought two different brands on Amazon trying to find stroopwafels that were as close to the ones a friend brought me from the Netherlands. These weren't as good as ODelish Dutch Delight. These weren't as buttery, and something about the texture was off.",3

"The sticks, although rather expensive, and some, not all, stink when chewed by the dogs in small quarters like our travel trailer, are such a great treat and energy dissipater, we like to have plenty on hand. The 7"" size is good for our 5-8 pound Papillons. They look kind of cute carrying their stick around like Groucho Marks with his cigar! When the dogs have a Red Barn Bully Stick handy, there is no mischief chewing of chair legs, carpets, blankets, and other stuff they like to nibble at. We buy them by the box of 35 if we can find them, and this recent purchase through Amazon was painless, except for the hefty price tag.",4
"I bought this whole box of 30 individual packs from Amazon.com.<br />I had no idea, and I did not have to know that it came from some third-party trading company, Nishimoto Trading/SE, Kent, WA98032, then, shipped to Lewisberry, PA, via UPS, then redirected to my home. This was all put on the box.<br /><br />Inside the usual Amazon brown cardboard box, There was the snack's original white packaging box from Samyang, quite beaten, then, inside, the 2 layers of individual packs of 15 each. While the individual package should be air-sealed for freshness of this fried snack, the bottom half lost its air, and , the sweet smell of the snack, was everywhere.<br /><br />It looks like the Korean manufacturer overstacked the packaging boxes in their storage location or from shipping to burst the snack's tight air seal. I wish the packaging material is thicker not to collapse and the box size bigger to keep the snacks all air-tight, and not crushed from tight space all the way to US customers.<br /><br />The snack, itself is still fresh, hah!, from the broken packs,  as it is only 5 weeks old from original manufacturing date.""w""<br /><br />______________<br /><br />The Chang-Gu snack is very well-known steady seller from decades of old days when there weren't many choices of snacks way before a supermaket type of shops were introduced in Korea. With clear coating, with some honey, on the fried loop-shape flour, with sprinkles of toasted black sesame seeds, it is savory and sweet snack that anyone can enjoy. This is my second best snack from Korea. The first is Mat-dongsan, of course!",3
"I was making vegetable curry for my sister who had never tried curry before, and just before I add the sauce I tasted it.  Ugg!<br />Thankfully I had a jar of fresh and easy curry in the cupboard to save the meal.

"I bought this thinking it was going to be a lot of gummy bears, just to have at work. But turns out that 5 pounds isn't as much as I thought it would be, a co-worker and I finished these in about a week. I thought $15 was a great price for the amount but it really is not. I have gone to other stores such as Target and bought some of the generic gummy bears which taste almost exactly the same for about half the price. But then if you really do like the Haribo gummy bears it is a good purchase, but if you are not picky I would suggest you buy some generic ones.",3
"This body wash has a nice masculine scent.  The tiny abrasive beads are nice, and not nearly as ""rough"" as a lot of other microbeads I have felt.  Unfortunately, they are still too rough (and the scent probably too strong) to be used on the face.<br /><br />To get the full effect, I even purchased the oddly-shaped <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TSA90C"">Dove Men + Care Active Clean Shower Tool, 1-Unit Packages (Pack of 4)</a> that Dove markets alongside the body wash.<br /><br />I don't think we'll stick with this body wash, as it doesn't seem to provide anything special in comparison to the existing favorite.",3
"I thought this was pretty decent. I found the scent pleasing without being over-powering and the scent did not linger in an obnoxious way. The body wash lathered nicely and when rinsed off, did not leave my skin as dry, flaky and scratchy as some other products I've used in the past.<br /><br />What is disappointing is that this product contains Petrolatum which is a by-product of petroleum (also known as petroleum jelly.) Petrolatum has been linked to causing or inflaming acne, it can actually clog your pores and of most concern is that it has been recognized as being a possible cancer risk. A bit of Googling will reveal all of this and more.<br /><br />Bottom line for me is that there are plenty of other skin care products that do not contain Petrolatum. I would not buy this again.",2
"This was disappointing. Didn't like the taste...too chemical. Too much caffeine for most. Little to no raspberry or acai in the product. And, we stopped using it because the oral mucosa of both of our mouths was irritated by the ingredients. Just brew some green tea. So much better. Add a little honey and chill it if you like. Peace to you and yours.",1
"Do not order these online.  They are shipped in the flimsy box that the grocery stores use.  No additional packaging is used to protect the inside.  My box was crushed on three corners, adding to the already crushed chips.  I wound up feeding them to the birds.",2
It is sweet and zero calories and good for you and your coffee. What more could you ask for? The delivery was fast and the price was reasonable. I'm a happy camper :),5
"I bought a jar of this stuff at my local grocery store based on the reviews I read here. It was under $10 and I like the idea of quickly brewing up a cup before I head out of the house. Well, this is a decent cup of instant coffee, and nothing else. These five star reviews must be done by NESCAF&Eacute; employees because anyone that has had a decent cup of coffee wouldn't give this so generous a rating. Compare it to Starbuck's VIA instant coffees and you'll see what I mean. If you are simply an instant coffee drinker then it will suit you fine, but don't expect any of the ""French Roast"" character you'll find in a regular ground coffee. I really wanted to like this coffee, but it just comes up short. Sorry.",2
"Most people know that cats can be finicky eaters.  They devour some food and simply walk away from others.  I guess that is one trait that I find most interesting about our three Bengal cats.  They can eat like horses and yet are rather picky about what foods they will eat.  They all like tuna, ham, and even beg for a potato chip from time to time, yet they don't seem to care for turkey and even some types of cheese.  My family and I love our cats very much, and we are concerned about their health and want to feed them nutritious food.  Since all of our Bengals love chicken, I was delighted to recently have the opportunity to try the new Petite Cuisine Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie Variety Pack.<br /><br />We received a 24 pack, which includes 6 individual boxes, each containing two 3 oz. cans of Sesame Chicken and two 3 oz. cans of Chicken Pot Pie cat food.  The ingredients for each flavor are as follows:<br /><br />Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e:  Chicken, Chicken broth, Carrots, Sesame oil, Soy bean oil, Rice, Tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, Tapioca starch, Calcium sulfate, Salt, Vitamins & Minerals (Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin D3, Zinc sulfate, Thaimine mononitrate, Manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfite complex &lt;source of vitamin K>, Riboflavin, Folic acid, Pyridoxine hydrochloride, Copper amino acid complex, Iron amino acid complex), Carrageenan, Choline chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e:  Chicken, Chicken broth, Sweet Potato, Carrots, Soy bean oil, Tapioca starch, Tricalcium phosphate, Guar gum, Calcium sulfate, Olive oil, Vitamins & Minerals (Vitamin E, Vitamin A, Vitamin D3, Zinc sulfate, Thaimine mononitrate, Manganese sulfate, Menadione sodium bisulfite complex &lt;source of vitamin K>, Riboflavin, Folic acid, Pyridoxine hydrochloride, Copper amino acid complex, Iron amino acid complex), Carrageenan, Choline chloride, Taurine.<br /><br />As you can see, the ingredients in the two flavors are nearly identical.  One controversial ingredient contained in both flavors is Menadione Sodium Bisulfite, which is a synthetic version of vitamin K.  MSB has been called ""potentially harmful"" by many researchers, and is not allowed in human food.  However, the FDA does not restrict the use of MSB in pet foods, and these pet foods are even able to proudly claim ""Natural"" on the label, even if it contains this un-natural ingredient.  Studies indicate that Menadione Sodium Bisulfite can be toxic in high doses, and the tests indicate that this synthetic vitamin supplement can prove toxic to kidneys, lungs, liver, and mucous membranes.  Since I only use the Petite Cuisine food as a supplement to my cat's regular food, I don't consider the levels of MSB to be high enough to put my animals in any danger.  However, it is up to the owner to determine if they find this risk acceptable or not.  You can find more information about Menadione (Vitamin K3) here:<br /> http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?page=menadione<br /><br />The manufacturer website (http://www.petitecuisine.com) says that ""Petite Cuisine is People Food for Cats.""  There is no wheat gluten, no grain fillers, and no meat byproducts.  The label on the cans says ""Product of Thailand"", and the website boasts that nothing about this food is sourced from China.  All of the meat and vegetables are steam cooked, and each variety is hand packed into each and every can (according to the manufacturer).<br /><br />We have been feeding the Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken Petite Cuisine entr&eacute;es to our three Bengal cats for the past several days now.  We dispense one can onto a saucer for all three cats to share, once each day.  One thing my wife and I really like about this food is that it doesn't have an unpleasant odor, like most canned pet foods.  It smells like chicken and gravy, and although neither of us are daring enough to try a taste ourselves, our noses tend to support the claim that this is ""people food for cats.""  The chicken pot pie entr&eacute;e contains several chunks of white meat chicken, along with small bits of sweet potato and carrots, all swimming in an ocean of gravy (or broth, sauce, or whatever you wish to call it).  The food looks good, but I feel that there is just too much gravy, and it could prove to be messy when serving or during feeding.  The sesame chicken entr&eacute;e contains shredded chicken (not chunks), along with bits of carrots and rice in a far more reasonable amount of gravy.  Both entr&eacute;es look good and smell good, but how do the cats like it?  Well as we observed our cats when we served up the food, here is what we found:<br /><br />Chicken Pot Pie Entr&eacute;e:  Asia, our 3 year old female Bengal, greedily devours the hearty chunks of chicken and veggie bits, but leaves most of the gravy behind.  Neo, our 10 month old male Bengal, also enjoys the chicken and licks up quite a bit of the gravy, but doesn't seem at all interested in the bits of sweet potato and carrots.  Matrix, our 2 year old male Bengal always approaches the food, sniffs at it for several seconds, and ultimately walks away without eating any.  Matrix will take a little taste, every now and then, but isn't interested in eating any quantity of it.<br /><br />Sesame Chicken Entr&eacute;e:  Asia again scarfs down the chicken and veggies, but leaves behind the rice and gravy.  Neo seems to eat a little bit of everything.  Matrix again sniffs at the food but will not eat any of it.<br /><br />So overall we have encountered very mixed results with our three cats.  Of course they are cats, so being somewhat finicky is only natural.  Two of the three seem to really enjoy the Petite Cuisine chicken entr&eacute;es, while the third doesn't care for it at all.  So would we buy this variety of Petite Cuisine in the future?  Well I think we will likely try some of the other varieties first, to see if we can get all three cats to enjoy the food.  Petite Cuisine also makes Yellow Fin Tuna, Red Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp, and New England Crab Cake varieties, which all sound like something our cats would like.  We are going to order the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2"">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and see how our cats like these varieties. My wife and I both feel that Petite Cuisine produces great quality food, with high quality ingredients, and we will certainly buy more of their products in the future.  I do admit that I wish they didn't use the synthetic Vitamin K supplement (Menadione), simply because so many others have expressed real concern about the potential risks of this ingredient.  Many other manufacturers have removed this ingredient from their products, so maybe PetPlay, Inc. (makers of Petite Cuisine) will omit this synthetic ingredient in the future if enough consumer concern is expressed.  I do recommend the Petite Cuisine chicken varieties of cat food to other cat owners, but do so with a bit of caution due to the inclusion of the controversial Menadione Sodium Bisulfite ingredient.  If Petite Cuisine tastes as good as it looks and smells, then I am sure all but the most finicky cats will enjoy it a great deal.",4
"This was a steal on sale, under $1/oz. Not quite what I expected, it was on the mushy side. Not the best for presentation. There is a sticker on the back of the box with a picture that depicts a dry-smoked-looking fillet. This has a texture closer to canned. But that's the only reason it gets 4 stars. It's very tasty, and would probably make a great ingredient (and use the fluid in the pouch), although we ate it straight. In fact, I bought another box while it was still on sale.<br /><br />If you do want decent presentation, slide it out of the pouch carefully onto a platter, drain and blot dry, and preslice with a very sharp knife to minimize serving debacles. Still looks pretty impressive.",4
"When I first tried Stevia, it was in one of those little packets, and it was in powdered form.  Yuck!  I was not a fan.<br /><br />Since I want to avoid both real sugar AND artificial sweeteners, I was disappointed....UNTIL I found out about this liquid stevia.<br /><br />It doesn't have the bitterness and strange flavor that the powdered form has.  And the slight vanilla flavor makes my coffee delicious.  In fact, when I go to my favorite coffee house, the coffee doesn't taste ""right"" to me until I add a dropper full of this Vanilla Creme stevia.<br /><br />I keep one bottle at home, one bottle at work, and one bottle in my purse...so anytime I want coffee, I am ready.  The price here on Amazon can't be beat, so I will be buying it here from now on.",5
"If I wanted unprocessed unsweetened cherries, dates, and almonds, I would eat them all individually, not mashed up and packaged up in a bar.  These taste terrible.  2 stars for being healthy, but tasting awful.",2

"My sister told me about this popcorn, saying it is the best she ever had.  Wow, I must have gotten a bad batch.  Mine is very dry, crumbly and hully.  The kernals fall to pieces and have so many pieces in hull in them, they are impossible to eat.  Will Not purchase again!",2
"Couldn't give these more than three stars. The smell turned me off. Smelt like old ketchup. Hard to explain. The texture was good, and the expiration date is well into 2012. Not something I really look forward to eating, but the flavor is ok. Just expected something different. If you have issues with smells, then you might not like these. Wished I had bought the Buffalo flavor. Won't repeat buy on the ketchup flavor.",3
"This espresso was a disappointment from the start: unpleasant aroma, coffee beans not oily at all. Smelled like the beans were old.<br />Anyhow, I made espresso with it and tasted it. Like how it looked, the taste wasn't good either. This coffee is more on the acidic side. It sort of smelled and tasted like instant coffee. I use Rancilio Silvia espresso machine and Rocky grinder so I cannot blame the machine for a bad espresso coffee. Do not buy this espresso beans if you are espresso drinker because you will know right away that you wasted money on a crappy coffee. If you have not found good espresso coffee beans, I suggest going to local Peet's Coffee shop(if available), and ask for Espresso Forte. Because the company roasts coffee beans every day, they have very nice aroma and taste awesome too.",1
"For the price, its just barely ok...<br /><br />for some reason, these crackers are *REALLY SALTY*. And I don't mean ""RITZ"" crackers, I mean *THESE* crackers. I have purchased Ritz crackers for years from many places but for some reason the ones in these shipments seem to contain 3-5x more salt.<br /><br />It is so salty that my gf can not eat them at all and was about to throw them away; but I like salty so I don't mind them..<br /><br />Also, due to packaging, many of the ones especially in the boxes packed on the outside came quite crumbly/broken.<br /><br />All around, just barely okay in my book....straight to the trash in my girlfriend's book....so I gave it a 2star.",2
"This is the fourth time I've ordered this coffee from amazon and I will be ordering more later when I need it. The coffee is at a good price and delivered in a decent amount of tim. It is always fresh and in good condition when it arrives. If you like this kind of coffee, my suggestion is DO IT!",5
They taste great. I like them.<br />It would be good to know more about the ingredients. Do they contain soy? Are they gluten-free? I would like to know.,4
Great for a change in tortilla chips. Tasty and not bland like some blue chips. Not too salty. A bit healthier than most similar snacks.,5
"My dog ate nothing but this food for 3 months. I gave him the recommended amount and everything. Not only didn't he lose weight, he gained 6 pounds!!! Not worth the money or the trouble although he loved the way it tasted. Smells very strong because it has salmon in it.",2

"I have an older cat and she has never been fussy about foods at all.  She will eat almost anything.  That said she wouldn't eat this at all.  Even when mixed with her old food gradually, she left it on the floor or in her dish. I have fed her other grain free foods and had good luck with them.  But she definitely didn't want anything to do with this one.  Now I wouldn't downgrade this much just because my cat didn't like it.  I down graded it because this is one of the worst smelling cat foods ever.  It is so strong smelling my kitchen, where her dish is, reeked.<br />Sorry I tried this and wasted my money.",2
Not gourmet.  Just typical store bought raisins.  Nothing special.  Not worth getting on their own.  I was purchasing other products from this supplier.,3
"I bought these as a healthy treat for my new boxer puppy. To begin with, I recieved canidae dog treats .. for senior and over weight. The description of the product does not mention this. My puppy ate the treats fine and seemed to enjoy them, but I found them to be a bit messy. After a treat there would be crumbs all over the floor. Nonetheless, my puppy found them tasty.",2
"I've picked up the smaller size at convenience stores and have always liked them.  I read some of the reviews and one person mentioned how very salty they were, but I bought this pack of 12 anyway.  I thought maybe he was just a little sensitive, but, wow, he was right!  I like the flavor, but cannot eat much of it at once. I eat only a small amount each time and close the package back up.  The small ones I get in the convenience stores don't seem this salty.",2
"Polar jarred fruits used to come from Mexico.  They are now coming from China.  I can attest that these strawberries do taste very delicious, but I am concerned that Chinese regulation is still weak, and that pesticides and hormones are being overused on a large scale (see the story on exploding watermelons from 2011).  I have also noticed that when they started coming from China, the price dropped; something wrong with a product being shipped all the way across the Pacific, and being cheaper than coming across a land border from Mexico.",2
"This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one. We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt, but I want to say that this has a ""rounded"" flavor meaning it isn't harsh or distinctive on food, rather it seems to become part of the food, going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way. Sounds silly, but I am learning good quality ingredients really make a difference.",5
"In general, I love Popchips.  (BBQ are my absolute favs.)  These are the chips I go for automatically at the store because of their crisp texture and great taste.<br /><br />This review is for the Chili Lime Popchips.<br /><br />They have a little heat for the Chili and a bit of acid for the Lime, however, I must admit that these are not my favorite.  The taste took some getting used to and, while not awful, this is not a flavor I'll be going back to.  The chips have the same great Popchip texture however, they left a bit of an unpleasant after taste coating the back of my throat.  An after taste that lasted quite a while.<br /><br />Since everyone loves different flavors, I'm sure there will be folks that will love these, but for me, the Chili Lime flavor rated a 3.  Not awful.  Not great.  Not on my shopping list.",3
"Ordered this for stocking stuffers. Thought I was ordering enough for everyone to have a package, not one peep each. Rediculous price to pay for chocolate marshmallows.",2
"I really like this product. It has good flavor and is not too salty, although I do find that you actually only need to use half the cheese sauce to get plenty of flavor. The seasoning packet was a really good too. We use this with ground turkey, but we found its really excellent with mushrooms too. The elbow macaroni is larger than the usual variety, making it a friendly size for kids to pick up. Its very similar to hamburger helper, and I think its really good.",4
"When I made baby food I liked to make massive quantities, freeze them in ice cube trays, and store them in Gallon storage bags.  After using the Baby Brezza for a few months it stopped working.  The company quickly sent me a replacement part, however during that time I realized it was much easier to just steam fruits and/ or veggies on the stove and process in a food processor.  It was a much more efficient method.<br /><br />The 'set it and forget it' motto is nice, however it cannot be used with every food.  Most fruits (apples and pears for example) have to be drained after steaming and before processing.  This means you can't just set it and foroget it.  Certain vegetables (broccoli) require adding water prior to processing.<br /><br />This product would probably be best for making smaller quantities and if you don't already have a food processor.<br /><br />It also comes with great recipes which are all from (...)",3
"LOVED this muesli, not anymore.<br /><br />It cost more now and not a good value.<br /><br />Secondly the new smaller sized box I just opened this morning consisted of raisins, oat-flakes and wheat-flakes. Where's the berries, cherries, black currants, cranberries and raspberries that this product claims to contain?",1
"I love Chai. But, I know that green tea is healthy, right? Well, green tea, let's face it, often tastes a lot like grass. Stash's Green Chai is green tea at its best. It's a nice blend of spices that really does taste very much like my favorite Chai. So, go ahead, enjoy Chai and feel good about drinking healthy green tea too. Just let it steep a bit longer than you normally would for black tea, add some honey and some milk (or creamer if you're lactose intolerant like I am). MMMM.",5
"My 7 month old LOVES real food and the new organic foods on the market have been a god's send.  I bought a box of the Sweet Ginger Chicken w/ Bananas & Coconut based on the reviews and the overall appeal of the name.  We are now feeding them to our dog, which is appropriate because it looks, smells and tastes like dog's dinner.  Looks: Dark and mealy- so dark that it seems like it must be organ meats (which I have no problem with if it didnt taste awful).  Smells: the smell is so strong the second you open the pouch and VERY much like a can of cat or dog food. Tastes: I taste all of the baby food I give my daughter.  It was pungent and metallic, where the banana and coconut were, lord only knows.  If you must try it, I get it I would too, just buy a packet or two and see how it goes.  Do not buy a case.  On a side note, my dog loves it! So no a total loss.<br /><br />In general the sprout meals are delicious and the texture on the level 3's are chunkier than Plum or Happy Tot.  You can see bit of veg and grains.  Holiday Veg w/ Turkey is a big hit as is the Pumpkin Peach Graham (I serve together but not mixed).  Roasted Banana Mango is really yummy and she LOVES the Yukon Golds with Squash and Parmesan.<br /><br />Beyond Sprout, we prefer:<br /><br />Fruits and Veg: Ellas for a richer consistency and better flavor than Plum or Happy Tot.  Parsnip, Carrot, Apple is a surprise hit. Plum fruits are watery and water is even listed as first ingredient on some. However, the Plum Mish Mash line is much better and my daughter eats all of it.<br /><br />Breakfast: Happy Squeeze (tot) Organic Super Smoothies are awesome, in fact, I'm going to start having them for breakfast myself.  ALL of them taste excellent! Have 100% adult dv of vitamin C, 1/2 vitamin A. 6 grams or so of protein and under 100 cals.  They are thick, and creamy.<br /><br />Dinner: Plum Training Meals seem to be her favs along with the Sprout brand (other than the curry chicken) We have yet to try the salmon but have a case of it ready to go.  She likes the potato and turkey with rosemary (tastes like an herby mash potato) and the chicken pasta (not something an adult would like but I think she likes the texture of the visible chunks of pasta).  My girl has never been able tohave abottle more than 100ml but can eat a whole 4oz training meal.  GO figure!<br /><br />We have landed on plain cherrios vs the canisters which she lost interest in.  Straeberry mum mums NOT caramel or plain and teething bisuits above those.<br /><br />I cant beleieve how much baby food has evolved in a year.  I heat up breakfast and dinner and serve lunch icy cold.  She seems to like the changes.  I got the plum spoon that screws on for when we ar on the go but as a rule, the playtex spoons with silicone are THE BEST!!!! and I have a drawer full. I hope this helps, we really have tried all the snacks and foods we could get our hands on in store and online.",1
"Wonderful! I have a busy job that keeps me occupied with little time to take meal breaks. I take a couple pieces of this and some fruit and veggies, and I get to have healthful snacks instead of relying on fast food or candy bars. Helped me lose 20 (and counting) pounds!",5
"My dog eats Merrick food, and I thought it would be more convenient to start ordering it from Amazon in cases instead of hauling it home from the pet store every few days. Plus, it's a couple of dollars cheaper to buy it here versus at my neighborhood store. Unfortunately, though, the case of cans didn't survive shipping well at all--of the 12 cans, 4 were so severely dented that I don't think it's safe to feed their contents to my dog. I'm not talking about a little indentation at the rim, either--they were totally crunched and bent, completely trashed. I have no idea whether this was because the cans were too delicate, whether the Amazon box wasn't properly cushioned, or whether the package was abused in shipping, but I have noticed that even when I buy this brand at the pet store, I have to check really carefully to make sure that the cans are in good condition. Whatever the reason, this shouldn't happen, especially for a pricey brand like this--when cans get dented, it can let in air and bacteria that can spoil the food and make your dog sick. Given that 1/3 of what I bought was unusable, I ended up paying roughly $28 for 8 cans of dog food. That's way, way more expensive than supporting my local pet store. If these cans don't survive transport very well, it makes a lot more sense to me to buy them locally, when I can avoid the bad cans.<br /><br />Shipping headaches aside, however, I do recommend the food itself. My dog is a picky eater, but she seems to enjoy Merrick products well enough. They are made of high quality ingredients, and even though she has a sensitive stomach, they don't give her any trouble. I just wish that they'd pack the stuff in a container that could survive the transport to my house!",2
Coffee blend is fairly good. However three empty K cups out of 36 is pathetic. K cups are too pricey for this kind of nonsense.,2

"I LOVE Kind bars, but these are terrible.  Upon taking one bite they tasted stale and not like any other Kind bar product I purchase on a regular basis. I litterally had to spit it out after taking a bite...and that's extreme..sorry!!  Steer clear of these new bars, I really think something was wrong with them, again I couldn't return due to Amazon's policy.  Very disappointing.",1
"I personally did not like these, but I gave the rest of the box to my mother and she had me order two more cases.  These are probably a good item for dieting because you think you are getting a lot for the calorie amount, but the flavor to me (and my husband) was sort of gummy and styrofoamy.  I could not finish a whole bag.  That didnt mean I was full, that meant I had gotten tired of them and wanted something more satisfying.  It is like eating a pound of celery when you really wanted a grilled cheese.<br /><br />By the way, I love the Pop Chips.  Much more flavor.<br />And my review was up for no less than a minute when I got a ""not helpful"" so I am not sure how this is not helpful, but the company requested that I write a review. If they are not happy that I didnt like the product, that is too bad.",3
Like the chips; however this last time the bags only contain 8.1 ounces not the 9 ounces that<br />the ad says.  That equates to a whole bag (10.8 ounces) is missing.  What gives?!?,4
"This product does not have an overpowering smell of salmon and taste-wise it was ok. It sort of taste like a piece of onion with salt and a bit of pepper.<br /><br />I bought this today for the first time thinking it would be great because it was Salmon. I was wrong, very wrong.<br /><br />Where Snack Masters losses all it's credibility as being, ""Snack Masters"" is in the texture of this jerky.<br />How can they expect people to eat this stuff? It is very dry, rough, and sharp. If you've ever held wood bark in your hands then you know what it is like to hold this jerky.<br />If you try to snap a piece in half it makes the same noise as if you were breaking a chicken bone. I have a headache from trying to eat this stuff and I'm expecting puncture wounds in my stomach any minute now.<br /><br />If your teeth are made out of knives give this a go, if not stay clear.<br /><br />Taste: 6.5/10<br />Texture: 1/10",1
My dogs' vet recommended the CET HEXtra for the tartar build up on my older dog who has had dental cleanings. It works! It has also helped my other dog who has never had a dental cleaning. It does have a medicinal smell. The dogs of course LOVE these things.,5
"I love Morrocan chicken and a good Ras El Hanout spice is essential for this dish.  I was suprised at this blend, it differs significantly in the balance of flavors from the one I was originally introduced to.  This is a much more savory - curry-like spice than the more sweetly cinammon-heavy original I started with.  I'll have to try others to understand better if there is a 'standard' for Ras El Hanout!",3

"This was nothing special. It reminded me a lot of other commercial chocolates I've tried.  I was disappointed that it was relatively waxy, and it didn't have enough of a dark chocolate flavor. It was a lot sweeter than what I expected. I would choose this over Hershey's or Ghiradelli, but there are a lot of other organic brands that provide a better chocolate experience (Dove Dark is even better than this).<br /><br />I did appreciate that it came wrapped in foiled paper.  It might make for a nice alternative to other commercial bars if you're looking for something wrapped up more like the old Hershey bar design. I can see someone removing the outside wrapper and putting a custom paper wrapper around the foil as a favor for a baby or wedding shower or maybe a special anniversary party.",3
"This cereal has a crispy whole wheat outer shell filled with a sweet chocolate flavored filling. The outer shell tastes fine and surprisingly crispy for holding a semi-solid filling. However, the filling is too sweet and feels a bit sticky. When you bite the cereal, the filling comes out and sticks to your tongue and teeth making it a not so good experience esp when you eat your cereal with milk.",3
"I ordered a package, and have used up all 10 cans. I am ready to order another package. But the price tag shocked me. $25 for 10? Give me a break. I forgot what I paid last time. If I indeed paid $25, I might be out of my mind that day.<br /><br />Yes. The product tastes good, and the can is very easy to open. I can get a lot of protein and omega-3 without a lot of sodium and calories. But a regular can of sardine is only 50 cents or even 33 cents in the grocery store. Why do I want to pay so many times more? I didn't get a raise. I need to save my $ to pay my gas bill.<br /><br />I decided to go for local brand. If I take in a bit more calorie or sodium, I'm try to eat less of other stuff. Higher fat may not be bad, because it may mean higher omega-3. And I love the bones, because they contain calcium. I do not need boneless sardine.",3
"Great taste and go well with coffee.  They are wrapped into two packs inside the box, which is useful for snacks for the kids.  It is also helpful because once you open a pack, they get a bit stale couple days later.",4

Bottle was NOT as full as pictured here.<br />It was about 2/3 full.<br />The level was BELOW the bend or break in the neck.,2
"****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, and that's great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****",4
"Wasn't expecting much from this premium green tea. Although I drink tea almost daily and enjoy a wide range of standard brands (Bigelow, Twinings, etc.; some product from Chinatown, as well as tea from companies with more pricey and custom blends such as Marriage Freres, Republic of Tea, Harney & Sons, and some blends from online tea merchants), I can't say I'm an ""expert."" I just know what I like and enjoy.<br /><br />And I really enjoyed this tea, once I stopped expecting it to taste like a typical green tea. As others have noted, this is not a generic-type green tea. Thanks to the addition of lemon grass, lemon balm herb and verbena leaves, this is, to my palate, a more flavorful and ""spicey"" green tea.<br /><br />Now if you aren't familiar with, or don't like lemon or verbena, you may not care for this green tea. But if you do like either lemon or verbena, this is a delight. For me, it's a nice addition to my collection of ""special"" teas for relaxation and downtime...and bad weather.<br /><br />You can't always tell from the aroma as to whether or not you'll like a tea. But if you like that first whiff when you open the bag, you're generally on the track to a positive tasting experience. Not only did I like the aroma (I was even thinking ""Gee, can I put these in my closet to keep it fresh?"") but it smelled really fresh. For those of you who don't drink tea very often, you may not recognize the difference between old/stale teas and those that are younger and fresher. (Real people word choices here. As I said, I'm not a tea expert so I don't have the specific vocabulary to describe this aspect.)<br /><br />This product has the hallmark of a good tea: You can drink it ""as is"" without the benefit of any sweetner, lemon or milk. But some of you may prefer adding to it. You can also enjoy it without having to eat anything else. (Some teas just seem to ""demand"" crackers or something to go with them.)<br /><br />If I close my eyes while sipping, I can imagine being in one of the better tea parlors here in New York City (Think Bosie, Harney & Sons or Radiance in midtown). It's that kind of flavor but the cost is far more affordable than the by-the-ounce prices at such venues for their green teas.<br /><br />Haven't had a chance to drink it with a variety of food or snack items, but I suspect this could go with either moderately sweet or savory items.<br /><br />I also suspect this tea would be incredibly refreshing in hot weather when made as iced tea as its flavor has the lemony ""fresh"" bite I like in the summer and it would hold up with the addition of ice.<br /><br />A lot of people think you can't really get quality tea in a bag. And it's true that there is often a significant difference in the end product when you brew with a bag versus loose tea. However, in this case, I think the bag holds its own.",4
"The product is great as you can't find it in stores.  We love to use it sprinkled over white cheddar popcorn, which Target used to sell.  What an incredible flavor!!  BUT, the shipping charge was OUTRAGEOUS!!  DON'T fall for it!!!!",3

"I was excited to order these frozen lobsters.  They are one of my favorite foods.  They came quickly and were cold packed.  I assumed they would taste like maine lobsters , but they are laganstino type lobster which is like comparing filet mignon to hamburger.  I will still eat them, but wouldn't recommend them to anyone that likes maine lobster.  I was wondering how they got them out of the shell and the type of lobster they used has a thin one.  It's like a big shrimp or cray fish.",3
"I looked on the label and it only says the bag is printed in the USA. It gives no reference to where this food is made and although she gets this as a treat, I still want nothing that came from CHINA!!!<br />Hard these days I know. But for my kitty, only the best! So where in the heck is this food made?<br />Anyone know?",3

"These are perfect for keeping boxes off of countertops and out of cupboards. You can put two kinds in each, one on the bottom, to be taken from the opening there, and another kind on top, to be taken from the top. They look very nice when placed on both sides of the brewer too and give any kitchen or brewing station a sense of organization.",5

"I have tried other torani syrups and like them.  I have tried the DaVinci Caramel and love that.  I only tried this brand because it had a good price.  Now I cannot return it, and have wasted money.  There is no way I can use this.  It is absolutely disgusting!  I could not even drink the first cup that I made with this--it made me gag!  It does NOT taste like caramel at all!  It tastes like chemicals and has a spicy after-taste.  I will definitely be going back to using DaVinci.  Wish I had not wasted my money on this.",1
"I purchased this coffee because both the Newman's Own and Sumatran Reserve were priced up near $1 per k-cup this month, and I needed something dark and bold to replace them until the prices came back down.  This coffee brewed up strong, but had a bit of an empty, bitter finish.  The caffeine content is acceptable.  The package could have been treated a little better during shipping as there were lots of dents, crushed corners and sides, and evidence of bending on the sides of the k-cups.  None of the cups have thus far shown a broken seal though.<br /><br />Overall this is an acceptable extra bold style k-cup, but there are better options out there.  My favorites have been the Newman's Own and the Sumatran Reserve.  I haven't tried the Black Diamond K-cups as they are a bit pricey right now also.  I'll probably end up using a coupon and buying my preferred flavors in a brick and mortar store nearby for a better price, or ordering some Coffee People 50-count extra bold flavors.  Their boxes have had pretty stable pricing for the past 6 months or so.<br /><br />If you are out of options, this is a cheaper substitute for a pricier extra bold flavor.  I wish Amazon could sort out their supply issues and keep K-cup prices a little more stable.  Lastly, I wouldn't buy these again if I had other similar priced options.<br /><br />TL;DR - These are okay, but go for other extra bold flavors if they are priced about the same.",3
"I love hazelnut spreads and I've tried many brands from Kroeger/Smith to imported versions and each has their own unique taste and consistency and I like discovery the differences. Maybe it was the Mocha Cappuccino flavor that turned me off, or just Jif's less than stellar version.<br /><br />It comes in a glass jar and is about ten or twenty cents higher than other local brands available to me but I thought, no one can mess this up. It's chocolate! Well, I was wrong. The major issue I have is the fact that when I opened it, a thick layer of oil was sitting right on top. Yeah. OIL. Yellowish oil. Well, that's on me since  I should have checked the label and the number first two ingredients are SUGAR and VEGETABLE OILS. I drained that off and stirred it, finding it incredibly soup-like, as though it'd been sitting under the sun on a hot summer day. The taste is not bad, but it isn't great either. It's very sweet and the Mocha flavor does offset it a bit but it has none of that richness or thickness like other versions I've tried and the Mocha flavor is just...off. I've tried putting it on the usual suspects, like fruit and toasted bread, in no-bake cheesecake and hot chocolate, but it just doesn't cut it.<br /><br />I can see how some may like it, especially if you've never tried hazelnut spread but trust me, if you want the real mccoy, try: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Y5M"">Nutella Hazelnut Spread, 13-Ounce Plastic Jar (Pack of 5)</a> (by far The Best and, at last, accessible and rather affordable...everywhere!), <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M6DC9Y"">Nocciolata Hazelnut w/Cocoa & Milk (6/9.52 OZ)</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EE5G72"">Natural Nectar Natural ChocoDream, Belgian Cocoa Spread with Hazelnuts, 12.3-Ounce Glass Jars (Pack of 3)</a>, all of which are amazing and SOOOOO much better!",1

"I actually got this flavor for my husband who really does like flavored coffee, usually I'm not a fan of them. After trying a French roast K-cup in my brand new coffee brewer and being very disappointed, I decided to give this one a go. Brewing a cup with 5 ounces of water makes a very nice medium strength, vanilla flavored coffee that tastes pretty good in the morning.<br />Usually when I have vanilla coffee, I grind an inch or two of a vanilla bean that's leftover from cooking into dark roasted beans and brew coffee in a regular drip brewer. Compared to that, this coffee is a lighter roast but with a nice flavor, and the vanilla flavor is mildly sweet. This is a coffee k-cup I would serve without hesitation to my dad and I think my husband will love it.<br />Definitely planning to try more of Van Houtte's flavors.",4

When I first got it, it was still cold and I had to run it under hot water so that enough of it would melt for me to use it.  I'm still learning about the uses and benefits but so far it is a nice, very light oil that I love.",5

"UPDATE: Received and have ground, brewed and drank this several days now. We tasted NO difference in this bag from our years of drinking Ethiopian Yirgacheffe. It is up to our standards for daily brew.<br /><br />We had been buying from this roaster direct, but the savings thru Amazon on shipping are significant, doubly more if you set up the subscription. I'm left wondering is this batch is what the roaster would consider less than their freshest/premium because passed a certain number of days. Most of the roast date label (see below) was torn off this package. As mentioned in my review of their Decaf Espresso, I the label should be intact. On the buyer side, no one should assume you will get the absolute freshest roasted coffee via a longer supply chain and at a significant discount. (But that too could change soon.) It looks like the bag I received was roasted in 2011 since the only remaining digit is a 1 at the far right.<br />=============<br />We have been drinking Ethiopian Yirgacheffe for many years. Most recently buying 5 lb Whole Bean from Coffee Bean Direct and prior to that from a roaster out of Texas. Our tastes greatly prefer the African coffees, including Kenya AA, over the South and Central American and we like the medium roast which maintains the nuanced flavor. (Needless to say, I'm not a fan of ""Charbucks"" :-)<br /><br />I'm going to try adding this subscription to our others as it allows ordering the coffee in single bags while keeping the postage under control. NOTE: The coffee we have purchased DIRECTLY from Coffee Bean Direct has a label on the bag indicating the roasting date. I just checked an empty one and it shows 34310, meaning the 343rd day of 2010. That's early December if my math is correct. I will check the bag I receive via Amazon to see how old it is when it arrives. Normally the coffee is in our hands within 7-10 days of the roast date.<br /><br />For us, treating the roasted beans like the perishable item they are maintains the flavor to the end of the bag. Here are the steps I take:<br /><br />When the bags arrive (not just Coffee Bean Direct, this includes other roasters sending whole beans) they are not evacuated like you see with some of smaller the European ground coffee packs. Maybe the one-way valve ISN'T so one-way or they just don't go through the necessary steps :-)<br /><br />Before it goes in the freezer I evacuate the bag with one of the hand held vacuums that has a high level vacuum. (It is a Shark brand and while mediocre as a cleaning vacuum it is killer to evacuate these bags. It turns them into a solid brick AND the room smells like fresh roasted coffee!) After evacuating I put a piece of shipping tape over the one-way valve to keep air from leaking in. The bag stays evacuated until opened, several months in one case. Bags are stored in a deep freeze that has to run a defrost cycle very rarely.<br /><br />When needed we refill a sealed ceramic canister with enough frozen beans for several days drinking. We do our grinding prior to each brew.",4
"I have been ordering this coffee for about a year because it was the best deal around. Using the Amazon Subscribe and Save program, a pack of 50 K Cups previously cost $17.85 delivered. That's .36 cents a cup. The cost went up a few months ago to $23.59 for a box of 50. That's .47 cents a cup. The new Amazon price is what you would expect to pay in any retail store. I see K Cups selling for $11.99 for a box of 24. I will keep watching to see if this price increase is temporary. If it isn't, my Subscribe and Save days are over.",3

Threw it in the trash.",1
"I purchased this product after reading the great reviews here on Amazon and on cocktail-oriented websites. Having spent a good deal of time experimenting with different recipes to make my own cocktail cherries, I was eager to try this classic product. I very much expected to love these.  Unfortunately, I found these a little disappointing, and I thought I'd share a more measured evaluation with other Amazon readers.<br /><br />Visually: The Luxardo cherries look great; nearly black in color and coated in a very thick dark red syrup. They're also small; maybe half the diameter of a bing cherry that you might buy in the produce aisle. I think they're somewhat smaller than the commonly available cheap pink maraschino cherries.<br /><br />Aroma: They smell very nice. Like cherry soda, I guess.<br /><br />Texture: They're quite firm. When you bite into them, there's a slight ""pop"" before they dissolve into sugary goo. It's a little weird if you're expecting the texture of fruit.<br /><br />Taste: This is my big complaint. Yes, there's a nice cherry flavor, but it's completely overshadowed by the fact that they are SWEET. I mean unbelievably, mind-blowingly, unpleasantly SWEET. They are a mouthful of pure cherry-tinged SUGAR. I hadn't quite realized this from reading the earlier reviews, and I was expecting something like a slightly sweetened natural cherry flavor. Make no mistake: this product is candy, and it no longer has any similarity to the texture and flavor of an actual cherry.<br /><br />I purchased this product to dress up our cocktails, but I don't really want to drop a lump of candy into my manhattans. However I didn't want to give up on this expensive product, so I've tried an experiment to try to salvage them: I've poured off most of the syrup from the bottle and topped it off with unsweetened brandy.  I'll let it sit for a few days in the fridge, and then I'll check back to see if they're more palatable. I'm hoping the booze will temper the cloying sweetness of the product.<br /><br />In the meantime, we've gone back to using our home-made cocktail cherries. They actually taste like cherries.",3

"I believe this to be a perfect dog treat and have great respect for everything that Newman's Own Organics does. Unfortunately, my two dogs (male 9 yrs & female 3 yrs) just are not impressed. I think perhaps if the 'cookies' were a little less dry and / or their excellent quality ingredients were just a little more aromatic that they would be more tempting and desired by my spoiled, but well loved dogs. If I break the cookie in half, it seems to release slightly more tasty aroma and I can almost talk the dogs into them.",3

It arrived (damamged I might add) and it is a combination of 3 flavors...2 of which no one in my house likes. What really is awful is I paid 50 bucks...this exact same box is at my local walmart for 25.99. The price is WAY too high...totally not worth it.",2

"I'm a fan of (most) Izze sodas and a big fan of pomegranate, so I thought this flavor would be a sure bet.  I was, however, disappointed.<br /><br />First up, the good.  The 8.4 ounce can size is perfect for a quick thirst-quencher.  While the calorie count is comparable to other regular sodas, it's a bit lower and consists of natural sugars from juices... not high fructose corn syrup. (What is that stuff anyway?) And, it's fizzy.  I like the fizz.<br /><br />Now for the bad: it barely tastes like pomegranate.  I realize that most folks would be turned off by an overly-tart, full force pom flavor; but the can promises pomegranate.  Yet reading the ingredients, pomegranate is listed fifth in the juice list. Fifth.  Behind apple, grape, pineapple, and lemon.  Oddly enough, the sixth juice: cranberry, seems to steal the show as that's the flavor I was able to notice other than the over-powering grape.<br />And that makes me sad.  Izze's other flavors (like grapefruit and clementine) really showcase the fruit on the label.  Just not here.<br /><br />If you'd rather have a sweet drink than a real pom experience, give this a shot. But if you're looking for some honest pomegranate flavor, look elsewhere.",3
"Add this with the linkettes and your family can enjoy a hotdog with chili that is healthy and as good as any. To make the chili I add olive oil, onion and ketchup. You really need to add oil to this in any kind of frying pan situation to keep it from sticking. The only downfall here is it looks a little like cheap canned dog food but once it's out of the can the appeal surfaces.",4
I was taking Fenugreek along with Alfalfa and mothers milk tea for months to increase my supply and I the combo had. Then my baby became very gassy and making our lives miserable. I suspected everything from my food to the supplements. I tried cutting different foods then reintroducing them and no change. Finally I decidedvto read up in the supplements and found that in 20% of babies Fenugreek causes gas and/or fussiness.<br /><br />So the next day I stopped taking it. Now 1 week has passed and not only has my baby's gassiness gone away I oddly feel that I have more milk.<br /><br />I'm sure this works for some so can't say it's bad. Just be aware that this can happen.,2

"I've always loved peanut butter and have been inclined to mix a spoonful or two into whatever I happen to be eating.  This is a great way to get that wonderful peanut butter taste without the fat, calories, and gloppiness of peanut butter.  The powder form makes it great for stirring into soups or oatmeal or sprinkling on yogurt.  I've tried it reconstituted as well, but I don't think it has quite the same consistency of peanut butter as the real stuff, so I woudn't be inclined to use this like peanut butter in a sandwich or just eat it by the spoonful.  It does impart a nice flavor though, and I don't detect any weird or chemically aroma or flavors -- it's just nice and peanutty.<br /><br />I ordered this and a version of PB2 with chocolate.  PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter and Powdered Cocoa Peanut Butter - 85% Less Fat and Calories - 6.5 Oz Each - 2 Pack.  Frankly, I couldn't tell much difference between the two.  They both have a strong peanutty flavor.  I think I will stick with just this plain version if I order it again.",4
"My new addiction:  peanut butter and coconut oil on toasted wholewheat bread.  It's yummy and healthy.  Also, coconut oil is a delicious change from olive oil in salad dressing.

I've also been using it on slaw.",5

"These work just fine in any Keurig-style coffee maker - if it uses K-Cups, it can use these.  If anything, these are probably a bit more environmentally-friendly than standard K-Cups simply by virtue of containing far less plastic.<br /><br />The only problem is, they just don't taste that good.  The coffee itself leaves something to be desired, surprising considering the history of the company that makes these. (full disclosure: I worked briefly for these folks back in the late '70s. Since I have a personal connection to the products, I really wanted to like them) I liked this better than the Rainforest Blend (which I found weak and watery) but not as much as the French Roast. (which I didn't really care for that much when I first tasted it, but found it grew on me as I worked my way through the case and compared it with other K-Cups)<br /><br />Keep in mind that this review is based on a single cup, and I didn't really like the French Roast when I first tasted it either, so you might want to take this with a grain of salt until I've had a few more opportunities to sample the product and compare it to other varieties.  I'll update if my opinion changes with time, but on first try, I doubt I'd buy this again.  It's better than the Rainforest Blend, but I'd be more likely to buy the French Roast than this.<br /><br />Like other One Cup varieties, these leave a bit more sediment in the bottom of the cup and produce more ""crema"" - the brownish foam floating on top of a good cup of coffee - than most traditional K-Cups.  The Fog Chaser seems to produce less than either the French Roast or the Rainforest Blend, for what it's worth. I found the flavor just a little on the thin and bitter side.",3

"Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers Ziti and Meat Sauce is very easy to use. To prepare it you remove the strainer lid and sauce tray, add water, and put the strainer lid back on. You then microwave the bowl on high for 3 minutes and 30 seconds, letting it stand for one minute after heating. Then you drain the pasta with the handy strainer lid and heat the sauce in the microwave for 30 seconds on high. When it is finished you mix and serve. The instructions are easy to understand and everything in the package is clearly labeled. You have a nice convenient meal in about five minutes.<br /><br />Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers Ziti and Meat Sauce is a good choice when you need a quick meal. It needs no refrigeration and has a long shelf life so it's a good item to stock up on. It is very tasty if a bit too spicy as the spices left a bit of an aftertaste. Because it is a single serving, it is not really for families at dinnertime - it is better suited as lunch, to eat after the gym, or for a single person. In fact, because it doesn't need refrigeration, it is a perfect lunch for people that work in an office, provided there is a sink nearby to drain the pasta. Because everything is contained in one package, cleaning is minimal - all you have to do is rinse out the containers to place in the recycling bin.<br /><br />While Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers Ziti and Meat Sauce is a healthy meal alternative there are a few things to be aware of. The meal has 340 calories - 50 calories are from fat. There is no Trans fat, but the saturated fat is 10% of the Daily Value and the cholesterol is 7% of the Daily Value. As with all prepared meals, the sodium content is high - 25% of the Daily Value.<br /><br />Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers Ziti and Meat Sauce is a convenient choice when you are pressed for time and not fussy about the type of sauce you use. However, it might be cheaper to buy your own pasta instead.",3

I have been buying them regularly and Whole Health Pet had the best price, special offers, shipping and service.

I am not changing ZiwiPeak for my dogs, but I am buying elsewhere which has slightly lower price overall but with faster shipping.

I would like to buy from AMAZON and save a trip to the store, even with cost of gas it's still cheaper to go to store (if I can resist all the other products there)",4
"It is a great product, however, who would spend more than 15 dollars on a 5-lb of rice? This is a total rip-off of the consumers who love this great product. Go to your local asian grocery (if there is none, drive 20 miles) and get it for less than 5 dollars!",1
"I got these in the momvoxbox from influenster.I am a cookie lover,however these were not my favs.My toddler loved them but he will literally eat almost anything sooooo that doesn't say a whole lot.",2
"From reading other reviews, it seems people either hate or love this tea with no in-between.  I happen to love it...am here to re-order.<br /><br />Last year this product disappeared from local stores so I reluctantly ordered this box of 6 ... good grief-so many! Surprisingly, barely a year has passed and I'm out (in spite of having an average of 4-6 other favorite boxes of tea open at any one time).<br /><br />As with most teas, the flavor definitely improves with a bit of milk or cream (my favorite) or honey (with the milk or instead of ...). Sometimes I brew two bags at once...my favorite: this vanilla nut with Trader Joe's Organic Mint Melange.<br /><br />Enjoy!",5
"These taste amazing, almost like candy to me.  Add in the fact that they're made from fruit and count as a serving of fruit and this is one great product.  Ideally I'd get my fruit by eating fresh fruits, but when that isn't an option, these are a wonderful alternative.  If you're looking for a sweet snack that is made from real fruit, definitely give these a try.",5
"For those of us who love bitter, strongly flavored jams and marmalade, this is the standard by which all others are judged. Incredible on toast or an English muffin in cold weather, it also is robust enough to be satisfying for a breakfast in the hot summer. I like the added flavor of the peel; those who don't will like the fine cut or the version without peel. This is not a marmalade for wimps.",5
"The dog food is excellent. My Akbash and Anatolians Love It... however the problem is finding it, and the shipping is as much as the actual product!",5
"We got this as a sample in our new keurig elite. I plan on buying many more! Even my 6 year old likes drinking this with me. If you like tea, you can't go wrong with this!",5
"I've had instant ginger tea that I like much better than this one.<br /><br />The ""lemon flavor"" is not real powdered lemon rind or juice. It irritated my throat, as most chemical flavorings do.<br /><br />""All Natural"" is one of those throwaway terms, and it is clearly misleading in the name of this product because the ""lemon"" is a chemical flavor and not ""natural.""",2
"Tapatio is one of my favorite go-to hot sauces, but this price is um... not good. Almost 4x what I normally pay. Wow.",1
"I'm having a 1920's theme party and since none of the ladies attending smoke anymore, I thought I'd get candy cigarettes instead of real ones to put in the end of the cigarette holders.  This item was a GREAT deal and comes with a lot of packs- the packaging is fun, but the ""cigarettes"" don't in the slightest bit resemble a real cigarette.  Good if you are purchasing them for kids, but defeats my purpose.  They are about the thickness of a lollipop stick, which makes them impossible to stay in the cigarette holders.",3
"I love my Keurig coffee makers. But most of the k-cups just aren't strong enough to give me the cup of Swedish style coffee I like...strong enough to stand a spoon up in it.  But the Coffee People Jet Fuel is a deliciously strong cup of coffee without any bitterness.  Goes down like butter and tastes great.  The box of 50 from Amazon is a super deal.  Problem is, my co-workers love it as much as I do so 50 k-cups don't last very long.",5
"I purchased this product after reading great reviews on here.  I really like chocolate / mocha flavors, and was interested to try the raspberry.  Got the two boxes, checked the dates (sometimes an issue with K-cups I have found), and eagerly popped one into my brewer.  Smell was amazing and I was excited.  But when I tasted it, I was so disappointed.  Not strong on either the chocolate or raspberry fronts, and the coffee flavor was weak as well.  Now I am stuck with 47 cups I don't want.  I wish I could recommend these, but I must dissent against the popular reviews.  I realize everyone's tastebuds are a bit different, but these are not for me!",2
"this was terrible coffee Wolfgang Pucks Jamaicamecrazy, I received a partial refund but felt I should have gotten a full refund as I can't drink the coffee and had to throw it all away. Also had to pay shipping and should not of had to. I would like a response to this.",1
"Dingo products are great, my dogs love them, but these are not for small dogs, too large and cumbersome for my two Shih Tzus..",3
"I tried this on three dogs, a border collie, a weiner dog, and a little taco dog. Each one showed an interest in only one of the three flavors, bacon being the top contender (two out of the three), as opposed to the chicken and liver flavors. However, the weiner dog (who has no other known allergies) was clearly allergic to this product -- she sneezed every time she licked it so I gave her no more. She has never sneezed like this before.<br /><br />In summary, with all the treats that are available for dogs these days, even though this one is a low-calorie type, I would pass it by. It seems like a good idea but in actuality, I'm pretty sure that you'll be seeing this product on the sale table at Big Lots before too long.",2
"These arrived quickly.  I was eager to try them.  I put less than 1/4 cup on a paper plate and microwaved on high for 2 min.  Several of them were puffing up, but many needed more time, so I added 1 1/2 min.  Finally took them out.  The few that puffed correctly were good, however, many were still hard.  I have a new microwave, but perhaps its wattage is not high enough. I heated some lard in my fryer and tossed the under-cooked ones into the hot fat.  They puffed some more, and some of them were edible.  Then, I put a few of the uncooked chips in the fryer, and finally I had the pork skins I was hoping for! Hot, puffed, crispy, delicious. I used a spider to keep them in the oil until puffed all the way through. I would order these again for use in my fryer.",4
"Trying to be gluten free is hard enough without forcing others in your household to eat gluten free meals too. This is the best gluten free pasta I've found that has been accepted by everyone I've fed it to. Just like other pasta, make sure you only cook it as long as it recommends. Any more than that and it's too soggy.",4
Just discovered this flavor and prefer it to Hazelnut  - I  bought a small pack in the grocery store because Hazelnut seems to be scarce in my area.  Altho I wish customers could purchase K-Cups individually to try flavors;  I'm contented for awhile with the double 24 pack offered thru Amazon of the Green Mountain Caramel Vanilla Cream.,5
Was misinformed...this is not going to be 24 different K-cups. We received 24 K-cups--most of which were the same flavors. Disappointed.,2
"I don't have a coffee maker that takes the individual little packages this comes in so I undid them and placed them as regular grounds in my regular coffee maker. Each portion was more than the spoonfull I might have used, very generous portion, and made a grea tasting smooth brew with just the right amount of bitternss that even my wife commented on the taste being ""really good"". I did the same on Sunday morning and diluted the amount to almost half strength and it still more than held its own as a great tasting brew. Don't know if I would use it as a replacement to the one I use consistently but would most definetly buy it as a replacement if I was unable to find my brand.",4
"The taste is fine, but the K-cup container has opened at the seal during the brewing process on more than one occasion, resulting in a mouthful of coffee grounds!  I have never had this happen with any other brand of K-cup before and hope it is not the norm for Wolfgang Puck.",3
I am amazed with the texture this flour provides in pastries like cinnamon rolls and turnovers. It helps make life easier!,5
"Our daughter loved this formula. We used this formula for the 6 months or so. Baby growth (percentile height & weight) has been good during this time.<br /><br />Amazon baby subscription service is great: saved trips to stores many times (with automatic free delivery & discount). Also, flexible Amazon return policy is great .. had great customer service experience",5
Did EVERYTHING according to instructions.  Plants grew but flowers (that lead to tomatoes) that were supposed to appear by 4 weeks did NOT appear by 4 MONTHS (when I gave up)!!,1
"There is not much to say about this Caribou medium blend coffee.  It has an unremarkable flavor with a hint of bitterness.  A bit of cream and sugar will cover it up, but that shouldn't be necessary given the coffee choices available.<br /><br />Drinkable, yes.  The coffee isn't so bad that I must throw it away.  I'll finish them off, but I won't be a repeat purchaser.",3
"The cacao  is delish.  The packaging was great to able to share with a friend.  I have made brownies and fudge, raw they were amazing.  Great chocolate, say good-bye to Hershey 's.",3
"I love peas, but I don't love these. I found them a little bland, to be honest, and the texture is just like Cheetos. Better for me than salted peanuts though!",3
"I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo.",1
"Have been buying Between Roast in 1LB packages, 10 at a time from CC.  This figures out to be cheaper per oz and the taste is just as good as the  Between Road.  Use it in my Keurig using refillable cup (Ekobrew)  Get Great coffee one cup at a time.  Can't wait until Community Club offers their coffee in K-Cups because I'm lazy.",5
This is one of my favorite k-cup coffees. Bold and assertive but smooth and without bitterness. Unfortunately it's out of stock at Keurig.com where a 24 count box sells for $13.90(for members)and includes free shipping. I considered ordering a box here until discovering the unreasonable price plus shipping of this item from this seller. Buyer beware!,2
"Two of Aunt Gussie's cookies contain 23% of daily fat allowance!  The cookies are so full of grease they fall apart.  They may be sugar free and gluten free, but they make it up with mostly FAT!  I can't even give them to my grandchildren!",1
"With an enormous range of essential ingredients, including krill oil, a super-antioxidant rarely found in other pet foods, this product is ostensibly ideal for both cats and dogs. THE PROBLEM is that it contains so many NON-ORGANIC ingredients, including corn protein. Newer studies just released point to a greatly increased risk of tumors in animals that are fed corn, simply because ALL of the corn grown in the USA has been genetically modified (courtesy of one very large multi-national corporation whose name is familiar around the world.) You can't escape it. So until Wysong decides to produce an all-organic version of their Epigen WITHOUT any GMO ingredients, we won't be buying it anymore.",1
"Great for on the go, I work in a job that I don't always got to eat lunch on time so grabbing a bar is a great way to eat. These are great, the only thing is that it comes in a 5 pack because 2 bars are in each pack. But it is still a great deal",5
"This Sweet Tea takes just a second to make and tastes just as good as any you will try. I use a little bit of Agave in mine, and it makes it taste just as good as any other sugared down version. Also, you can't beat the fact that you can just drop it in your Keurig and have a glass ready in less than a minute.",5
"Box arrived shipped well and not damaged.  However, inside the box, every chocolate had been deformed with chocolate on the outside of the wrappers.",3
"We're heavy K cup users at our house, and always look forward to trying new types. I was excited to see this one listed, and ordered right away.  Wow! What a disappointment! When I opened the box, there was loose coffee all over the place, and the lids look like someone sat in front of their tv and glued them on by hand. So ok, I could probably have lived with that, but when I brewed it, it was terrible--nothing like any of the others on the market. It just tasted like old stale coffee.  I tried to return it, and it's not returnable.  If you want to try an ""off-brand"" of K cup, try the San Franscisco Fog Chaser--it's not actually a K cup but fits into the Keurig and the coffee is good.  As far as the Brooklyn one, fuggetaboutit!",1
"These berries are not for everyone (no one else in my family liked them), but I think they are great.  They do have a bit of a bitter aftertaste, but I just chase them with a couple of almonds and it is gone.  They really give me a little pick-me-up and I eat a little handful 2 - 3 times a day.",4
Cookies & muffins are something my son hasn't been able to have until now.  This mix has been a life-saver for me since my son is a very pickey eater.,4
"I ordered these to have at my son's Harry Potter birthday party.  The kids had fun eating them and trying to guess what ""nasty"" flavor each one was.  However, the two boxes are extremely small and I would not pay the almost $9 +shipping for them again.  If I had known how small the boxes were (I honestly did not check size before purchasing-lesson learned!) I would not have bought them.  I had to be very skimpy with the kids on how many they could try so that each child got to eat a couple-and we only had 10 kids there!  Fun, but pricey!",3
"Here are the ingredients that are on the label:<br />Ingredients: Gum Base, Maltitol, Sorbitol, Xylitol, Glycerine, Natural Flavor, Gum Arabic, Stevita Stevia extract, Resinous Glaze, Soy Lecithin, Carnauba Wax<br /><br />This is NOT a stevia sweetened product, not as one would expect with something called ""Steviadent"" and with ""Stevia Dietary Supplement"" on the front of the package. Stevia shows up #8 on the ingredient list even AFTER Glycerine, Natural Flavor, Gum Arabic. And the term ""natural flavor"" can mean anything at all. The manufacturer doesn't have to tell you what it is because it is considered ""proprietary information""--could be ANYTHING, most likely something artificial, unnatural and most probably, something unhealthy or else the manufacturer would be proud to list it openly.<br /><br />I made the mistake of ordering this gum without checking the ingredients first. I even popped one into my mouth. It was pretty bad both in taste and texture; had to throw away the rest.<br /><br />There's another sugar-free gum that has less nasty ingredients:<br />It's Xlear Inc. Spry Xylitol Gum<br />Ingredients: Xylitol, gum base, natural flavor (spearmint oil), vegetable glycerin, gum Arabic, soy lecithin, beeswax.<br />It still has Xylitol in it which some people's systems can't tolerate but generally most people can and so far, research shows that the only ""side effect"" is loose bowels in some people. That might be a plus for some folks!<br /><br />Spry Gums have a much nicer texture and taste in my opinion and come in several different flavors and in jars of 100 and even 600. So the savings is phenomenal.<br /><br />Made with non-GMO Xylitol made from corn.<br />http://www.amazon.com/Xlear-Peppermint-Sugar-100-Pieces/dp/B000COIT8Y/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1342563776&sr=8-4&keywords=Xlear+Inc+Spry+Xylitol+Gum<br /><br />PS: there are much better stevia products available anyway.",1
"5 hour energy will def. give you the kick you need. Occasionally I will use it if I have had a terribe nights sleep. It wakes me up immediately. But, I only drink half of it. A whole one is too much for me.",5
"These are simply the best cookies ever.  My kids love them, I love them.  They're so much healthier than other cookie brands.  I couldn't recommend them more!",5
"This basket is very attractively packaged; the sweets are well displayed and the basket is fairly nice, as this sort of thing goes.  The bow is attractive enough to save, and the basket holds a good variety, from biscotti to candy.  The frustration-free packaging was easy to open and protected the contents very well.<br /><br />The contents made nice snacks paired with coffee, with flavors running from very good to just so-so.  The Cashew Roca is delicious, as Roca-brand treats always are, to my taste.  The chocolate chip cookies barely earn the name, as they are very sandy shortbread (a texture unlike any I expect when I think ""chocolate chip cookies"") with tiny, scarce chips too small even to taste chocolaty.  The fudge is tasty, although there are only two small pieces.<br /><br />Therein lies my chief complaint:  All of the items are very over-packaged for the amount of food they actually contain, making the basket appear much more generous than it actually is.  For example, the fudge box measures 3 x 4 inches (that's it on the right in the picture of the filled basket), containing two pieces of fudge that measure just over an inch square:  12 square inches of box for about 2 inches of fudge.  The Roca box (on the left in the picture) is 6 x 3-1/2 inches, with three small pieces of Roca in it.  The cookie box was about 24 square inches, containing 2 ounces of itsy-bitsy cookies (each is about the size of a quarter).<br /><br />There is no dishonesty in advertising here, as the basket clearly lists contents of just 11.9 ounces.  However, the appearance is one of a large, bountiful basket full of treats, but it actually doesn't contain very much once all the packaging is disposed of.<br /><br />At the right price, I would suggest this as a nice, small gift with an interesting variety of treats -- emphasis being on small.",3
"This coffee is excellent if you like strong coffee.  I have tried Black Tiger, Jet Fuel, Wake Up Call, and most of the other XB coffees, but this is the first one that is strong enough for me in an 8 Oz cup.  For reference to Tassimo owners, this is very similar in strenght to the Starbucks Caff&egrave; Verona t-discs.<br /><br />I would NOT purchase from this any of the sellers selling it for twice as much as the other sellers though.  DO note that this product package cost you about $1/cup as you only get 1 box (of 24 cups) vs 2 boxes.  Otherwise, enjoy!",5
The coffee isn't bad but the blend is very mild. I brewed a cup of espresso with it and wasn't too impressed. If you are looking for mild this is for you.,3
"This fondant is amazing! I was very easily able to warm and knead it. It rolled out with no problems (except I forgot to put powdered sugar on the mat before rolling, which made it stick to the mat) and tasted amazing. Such a better taste than Wilton.",5
This is a joke!!  I have never been so mad as I am right now writing this.  Not only is the coffee a big joke the way they shipped it is as well.  The assortment in this is ridiculous.  The majority of the coffee is french vanilla.  And hopefully we will like spicy eggnog and kahlua because those make up pretty much the rest of the coffee.  This looks like somebody threw in the coffee they didn't like into a box and sent it to the sucker who was stupid enough to buy it.  I am not usually this brutall with reviews but this angers me.  The coffee was in a brown paper bag and thrown in a box to ship.  If I could return this I would but this is not a purchase that can be returned. How sad this is.,1
Weetabix Whole Grain Cereal<br />excellent source of energy.It is so tasty and will help you crave for it when you are really hungry . It can be used for breakfast or has a healthy snack with fat free milk. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves healthy cereal and this is one of a kind,5
We first learned about Douwe Egberts coffee when invited to a wedding reception and had a memorable cup of coffee.<br />We later learned that Senseo was using this brand and were hooked. Have been enjoying it ever since!,5
This is a good quality grain free doggie treat.  The product has a strong hickory smoky fish smell upon opening the bag which was not so pleasant at first.  I have two Shih Tzu puppies and they are not picky eaters so they enjoyed these treats.  They do have sensitive stomachs and these treats appear not to irritate their tummies.  I was a little disappointed to find out after purchasing this product that the company Natural Balance has had product recalls in the past.  I believe these treats are produced in the USA and quality control has improved.  I may try other products by this manufacture in the future.,3
My local supermarket started carrying these instead of the Duffy's brand they used to have. These have a sort of a crumbly texture and tend to fall apart. They also don't taste as good as Duffy's or the crumpets I've had on my trips to London.,3
"My 9 mo. old daughter only eats earth's best products and loves all of them - that is, except this. I can't figure out what it is, but we finally concluded that it smells a little like catfood. I tried feeding her this mango chicken flavor a few different times and she would only eat a few bites. I gave up and donated the rest to the food bank hoping someone else's child would like it. I have had a good experience with the ""subscribe and save"" products in general, no broken jars and the quick delivery is great. I find that it is cheaper than whole foods (even with the coupons). This is the only flavor of earth's best baby food that my daughter dislikes. For what it's worth, I suggest skipping this one or trying it in a variety pack first.",2
"The item I received did not match the picture or item name. I received a package of large, gummy stars in a SweetGourmet.com sealed bag. It did have a printed/copied label that said ""Swedish Fish Swediesh Gum Fish Aqua Life"" but the contents were not the Swedish Fish brand or the same as those pictured. Since I was looking for the Aqualife assortment, it does not meet my needs or expectations.<br /><br />It was shipped and received in a timely fashion.",1
My four Borzoi (Russian Wolfhounds) really like the taste of the beef formula and they are picky about what kibble they will eat.,4
I ordered these seaweed snacks thinking it was a neat idea with the packaging making it easier to take to work and munch on but not sure if my item was old or packaging compromised but it tasted old wasn't crisp.,2

"These sour punch straws are just TOO PLAIN SOUR!!!!!<br /><br />I've never tried them before, so I don't know if it's the product itself or the flimsy packaging, but someone is giving this otherwise-tasty candy a bad case of ""THE SOURS!""<br /><br />I am quite literally flabbergasted at the thought of a regular, red-blooded Earthling liking these alien treats!  YUCK!<br /><br />Two stars because I really like the pictures on the package...this is the main reason I bought these awful candies in the first place.<br /><br />My grandson likes them, though.  That is why I give the product four stars.<br /><br />God Bless.",2
"Great oatmeal, but BUYER BEWARE! Wal-Mart sells these boxes of 5 packets for $1.32 each. So you are essentially being charged $15.03 more than you need to pay!!!!!!",3
"The coffee is not bad, but the production quality is hopeless.  The seal that holds the cup lids to the plastic cup consistently fails, spewing hot water and coffee grounds all over the place.  I've written to the Canadian distributor (Timothy's Canada -- [...]), but to date they haven't even bothered to say ""sorry"" or even ""tough luck"".  Summary: the coffee isn't worth the hassle, as there are all kinds of other decaf k-cup products out there that taste as good, if not better. And it is disheartening in the extreme to have to deal with a supplier that cares so little about their customers.",1
"I received this product.  It was for my daughters wedding.  They were edible, but not fresh.  Kinda dull green.  Was disappointed.",2
"These cookies are pretty good.  They are soft and flavorful.  They are not amazing or as good as homemade, but what packaged cookie is?  These are better than other packaged cookies we've tried, and the nutrition information isn't horrible either.",4

"I'm shocked at the number of elementary students who seem to subsist on hot cheetos, so I took my containter of cocoa roast almonds to school to see if kids could be induced to try something semi healthy.  For my part, I found the almonds a little dry, so I was not sure how the kids would like it.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  They loved the almonds and begged for more.  So if you want to give your kids something more healthy for lunches and snack (and anything is better than hot cheetos) then this is a great product.  Now, if only we could get these cocoa almonds for the same price as cheap chessy snacks utterly devoid of nutritional value.",4
"As someone with food allergies, finding GOOD organic non-wheat products gets more challenging by the day in the USA.  These crackers (which on the box say imported from Belgium, FYI) taste great and have no questionable ingredients.  I only eat natural sugars (cane sugar, honey, or stevia) and natural oils  (olive, sesame, coconut, grapeseed, corn, soy).  The price was good (at least at the time I purchased it) and it shipped quickly in a box fitted to the bundle. In addition, QUINOA is known as the world's best super-grain with the most vitamins and minerals.  It's a tasty cracker that's actually good for you. Kudos on that feat! :)",5
"Nice packaging.  Makes one imagine rich vanilla flavor -- upon opening, this just smells rather thin, a sense reinforced when actually brewed.  VERY thin vanilla flavor.  I'd say delicate, but a more appropriate term would be weak.<br /><br />But the coffee isn't weak:  if you're into Starbucks' fare, this won't disappoint.  Since I'm not into Starbucks' fare (I subscribe to the narrative that they've hoodwinked the country into blithely accepting the fallacy that strong, acidic/bitter coffee is Primo, which it isn't), I wasn't surprised by the rather nasty aftertaste that not even 3-4 sugars per cup can mask.<br /><br />I love strong coffee, but good coffee can be strong and not offensively acidic with a bite at the end of the quaff that can peel taste-buds off.  It's all in the beans and the roast.  I don't know why Starbucks foists off fare like this on the public; oh, yes I do -- because it sells to those who don't know better.<br /><br />And, I see we're down to 11 (yes, ELEVEN) oz. ""pounds"" of coffee.  Why send 2 packages of 11 oz. (2 x 11 = 22), when one could just put it all into a true ""pound and a half"" 24 oz. bag?  It just makes no sense, the packaging costs are higher, and it's hardly more environmentally friendly this way.<br /><br />When I tell people I used to live in Seattle, they frequently say, ""OH, you must have gone to Starbucks all of the time.""  ""Only when I had no other choice,"" is my response.  If one is willing to pay boutique prices for coffee, one can do FAR better.  In fact, even if one is NOT willing to pay boutique prices for coffee....",2
"Makes a great sugar-free vanilla steamer, as good as Starbuck's, in my steamer/frother machine.  No calories added from lots of sugar when added to fat-free or any kind of milk.

Pop Chips are hard to find in the original flavor. So I ordered a whole case. Too bad that they are gone already! My son loves them.,4
good tasting coffee for the holiday season  great price and product came quickly and as promised  wonderful to have after a dinner party or on a cool winter evening after dinner.,4
"Cons:<br /><br />1. Erythritol is expensive. At $8.29/pound (which is the cheapest I've found online), and 113 teaspoons per pound, that's 22 cents per 3 teaspoons, to give the sweetening power of two teaspoons of sugar (sucrose.)<br /><br />2. It's not as sweet, teaspoon per teaspoon, as sugar, hence you use about 50% more.<br /><br />3. At 3 teaspoons per 8 fluid ounces of soft drink (or 6 teaspoons per 1/2 liter bottle) it gives me a little bit of STOMACH UPSET.  Therefore, I can't use it as the only sweetener.  I need to cut it back and use artificial sweetener to make up the rest.  (I make soft drinks using sugar-free drink mix, then add my own sweetener.)<br /><br />4. It does not dissolve well.  It takes a long time to completely dissolve in cool water, and even in water at room temperature.  If you want to dissolve it quickly, heat a glass of water in the microwave, dissolve it, then add to cool water in the pitcher with ice.<br /><br />Good:<br /><br />5. It's a ""good"" sweetness, compared to the artificiality of sucralose, aspartame, saccharine, or stevia.<br /><br />6. Of course, it's almost ZERO CALORIE, with NO GLUCOSE.  It's great for a serious weight loss regimen, and for diabetics.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Before I discovered erythritol, I used a combination of sucralose and stevia to sweeten my soft drinks. Maybe my digestive system will get used to erythritol.  But for the time being, I need to avoid 100% (or full strength) erythritol, and either use a little stevia or sucralose or sucrose to get the level of sweetness I want.<br /><br />I found generic stevia packets at Dollar General stores ($1.00 per 35 packets), where 1 packet of stevia equals about 2 teaspoons of sugar.  And you can get generic sucralose for about $1.00 to $2.00  for a box of 100 packets, or buy in bulk for even cheaper at Walmart.<br /><br />Bottom line, unless money is no object, erythritol is not a 100% substitute for sugar (sucrose).<br /><br />And, due to mild stomach upset (which varies person to person, some don't have any upset at all) it still can't be a 100% substitute, and needs to be used in combination with another non-irritating non-caloric sweetener, or even regular sucrose.<br /><br />If you're on a budget, and HAVE to cut back on sugar, it's just much cheaper to learn to get by with less sweets.<br /><br />Or, if you HAVE to have your sweets, learn what combination of sweeteners, (erythritol, sucralose, saccharin, stevia, sugar) gets you the flavor/sweetness you like at the calories and expense that you can handle.<br /><br />(Personally, I don't think sucralose and saccharin are as bad for you as aspartame. And stevia hasn't been studied enough, but probably isn't bad in small quantities.)",3
The candy arrived in a timely manner. The reason I rated it a 4 and not a 5 is because I paid as much for shipping as I did the product.,4
My brother-in-law is Vietnamese and a very hard man to buy for when its time to give gifts. The one thing he loves is Vietnamese cooking and my sister does her best to please. This Birthday I sent her some recipe books that required these. They live in a small town and the closest international store is two hours away. They passed the taste test!!,5
this freezer tray is not airtight --- so the puree will get freezer burn. I've had to enclose the tray in a plastic freezer bag before storing. I would expect it to work better for the price. However it is very easy to pop-out when ready to defrost.,3
"I had the same experience with pasta not cooking all the way through. I even microwaved a bit longer, but still it was really hard. Cheese tastes fine but I can't eat uncooked pasta. Very disturbing and awful!!! The other brad I had was good so I was hoping this was good too but beyond disappointing. I will never buy this again.",1
"This cookie hits just the right note for lemon lovers. Not too sweet, with a nice tangy flavor and no bitter or ""artificial"" taste.<br />It does have a granular texture from the brown rice flour, but that does not mean this is a dry cookie at all. It sort of melts in your mouth.",4
"I've had this product for about 6 months, and in the beginning it worked great.  I was using it every week to make a surplus of baby food to feed my daughter throughout the week.  I properly descale it with vinegar regularly, and follow instructions for water amounts.  Then, about a month ago I noticed that when I steamed the food there would be a puddle of water that formed underneath the mixer on the counter.  This worried me a bit because I'm not a huge fan of electrical appliances sitting in puddles of water!  I tried to tighten the blade so that it wouldn't leak, but no use.  I contacted the company, and they told me I needed a new rubber gasket which forms the seal around the blade hole.  I ordered one, and after I replaced the old gasket it worked fine for one steam, but then the very next time I used it the thing leaked again!  I ordered a five pack of the rubber gaskets, thinking that if I'm going to continue to use this thing I'll have to replace the gasket every time (absurd, but I really liked the product).  Well, I put in a new gasket, and it STILL leaked!  So now I'm left with a package of gaskets and a leaky baby food maker.  I'm going to attempt to contact the company, but I don't have high hopes for a refund or replacement.",1
"Unfortunately, I somehow stumbled upon this product and, based on all the glowing reviews, bought a case.  Upon opening the first bag and eating a couple, I was disgusted by the taste.  Worst thing I've ever ordered from Amazon---and I've ordered a lot.  I don't think the nutritional values are all that great, either.",1
the popcorn is awsome! very flavorful and fun! It is something that everyone in the family can enjoy and would be a great gift for all of your friends and family.,3
I ordered this and it came in a timely manner but when I opened it all the spices were hard as a rock like it was real old and the hog casing did not do well as they burdt very easily and also had many holes in them. I bought a High Mountain sausage making kit from a local sporting goods store and it was 100% better and tasted much better as well. Was not a happy camper with the results of this sausage making kit and will never purchase this brand again,2
"I tried Kellog's Raisin Bran, and this cereal is very tasty. There is just the right amount of cinnamon and sugar in the product. When the bran flakes are mixed with milk, I must admit the cinnamon and sugar tastes are awesome.  The reason why I only gave this product three stars is that the raisins and almonds are a little sparse. The raisins are plump and juicy, and the toasted almonds are crunchy and complement the cereal well.  Unfortunately, this cereal is mostly bran flakes. I think Kellog's needs to add more raisins and ramp up the almond content to the amount found in the Honey Bunches of Oats Cereals.  Then this Raisin Bran would be outstanding.",3
"Overall, these original SlimJims are pretty good, but very small. About the size of a golfing pencil, but there's plenty of them in the 100 pack, and I got a great deal. The texture is a bit tougher than fresh beef sticks, but overall tastes good.",4
Taste is okay.  Not blown away.  Hidden is the fact that this is truly a decaffeinated coffee.  Only place to find this out is on the bottom of the box.  Not what I want first thing in the morning.,3
"The first batch of 6-oz bags I got was perfect.  All the nuts were great.  The second batch I got had a lot of hard pieces that could almost break a tooth, in two of the bags.  I suppose I could try a third batch and see how that goes.  It might be a seasonal thing.",3
"I have to give it 1 star because they wont allow for any less... this ranch dressing is also waaaaaayyy too sweet, the chemical taste of the Splenda overtakes the taste of the actual product itself...I could never understand why they have to add soo much artificial sweetener to something such as a salad dressing, this is one of the five Walden's Calorie Free product I have tried and been VERY disappointed with... I was already taking my chances knowing it was sweetened with Splenda instead of Stevia but for God's sake why make it soo unpalatable?!  there are soo many alternatives out there and why kill it with soo much sweeterner?  My other reviews for these products may be around the same... but darn... I best just make my own dressing, might not be 100% calorie free but at least it will be consumable.  Why does RANCH need sugar?! WTF?  I have made ranch from scratch and never once did I add any sugar to it!  Also there is a dry chemical flavor that comes with this...  I am sooo lucky my healthfood store has a nice return policy because after tasting all these dressing products I could NOT use them and felt jipped because these aren't that cheap..",1
"I bought these because of the great price, but was a little disappointed because when I have bought  ""dried"" fruit in the past it has a ""jerky"" like texture.  This mango was still very thick, I think needed to dry a little more.",3
"We use to only get this mustard if someone we knew was taking a trip to New York.  It is really great mustard, has a spicy kick to it.",5
"Baby loves this and so do I. It's very tasty and great for breakfast or lunch. One of our favorite banana combos, but the beet comes through and of course the blueberry just adds a little something extra. Highly recommend.",5
"I have purchased this tea twice locally:  once in a box, once in a tin.  Shouldn't make a difference, right?<br /><br />The stuff in the box sent me over the moon.  I sang the tea's praises.  I was nice to everyone all day, every day, until the tea ran out.  It was a little slice of heaven.  I love mild green teas with full flavor but no bitterness, and that's what this was:  only with that special bergamot gift to my mouth.  Think angelic choir singing.  I had a new favorite tea!<br /><br />Also, miraculously, this tea did not make me vibrate.  In theory it's fully caffeinated, but I drank as much as I wanted without a single negative consequence, so I'm guessing this has less caffeine than most green teas.<br /><br />My SO was headed to the local bed/bath chain where I bought the box, so I begged him to pick up another.  He priced them out and got me a couple of tins instead.  100 tea bags of bliss!  Or so I thought.<br /><br />It still doesn't make me vibrate, but this batch has a lighter bergamot flavor and goes bitter very, very quickly.  It can taste like bitter soap with a &lt;1 minute steep.  I have taken to quick-steeping 3-4 bags at once to try to approximate the magic of my first box.  It's still decent and I still drink it, but it's only dimly reminiscent of that first glorious box I had of the stuff.  Perhaps the first box was simply a miracle.  Maybe the tin was a mistake.  I won't know until I buy yet another box, at which point I'll let you know.",3
I had been looking for a vanilla Stevia powder for months as Whole Foods no longer makes vanilla.  This NOW brand is even better tasting!,5
"My cat will only eat the Whiskas Choice cuts with beef.  My local stores quit carrying this product and I bought any cat food similar to it, regardles of price.  My cat ate only dry food for two months or more.  He lost weight that he can't afford to lose. I am so happy that I found this Whiskas item on Amazon.",5
"I think the jerky would have been good, but...<br />The packages I received contained jerky that had fuzzy white stuff growing on it. None of the packages had a read-able expiration date. The clearest packaging shows Aug 2011 (which means the product still had 6 months left in its life). When I contacted Lumen, however, I did get an email and phone call from them expressing their concern about my complaint. The man I spoke with was genuinely interested in investigating the problem. The company directly sent me three free packages to replace some of the moldy ones.",3
"My K cups came in all bloated, looking like over inflated marshmallows.  They won't even begin to fit in the machine.",1
"THese cost about $3 at TJs...  How could they charge over $10?  THey are delicious, my daughters' favorite. They are crunchy and sweet and very light.",3
This product is processed in a factory that also processes wheat and is therefore NOT appropriate for wheat sensitive individuals.,1
"I only have i bottle (bacon flavor), so I don't know if it is typical, but the ball does not roll easily.  My dogs can get the liquid treat, but only if I squeeze the tube a bit.  And they aren't small dogs with weak tongues.  They are a Border Collie and a Labrador Retriever.  They do enjoy the treat, thought the Border Collie is not overly enthusiastic.  The Lab is enthusiastic about anything edible, even remotely, edible.  A bit messy as it drips a little when I squeeze it, but then it's not meant to have to be squeezed.  I will check other reviews and if my hard-to-move roller ball is the exception, I will be ordering more of this handy, portable treat which is easy to keep mess-free in a pocket.",4
"While the flavor and quality of this chili is great, the 108-ounce can is mostly liquid. The number of servings is listed as 12, but the reality is that it will only serve about 5, unless you add more of your own ingredients as the first reviewer indicated. I won't be purchasing this again.",2
"These Jelly Belly Jelly Beans cam vacuum packed, fresh, and tasty.  I like being able to order individual flavors.  Excellent product.<br />- Chris Teifke",4
"I thought this would be a good gluten free replacement for Annie's mac n' cheese, but this was not really macaroni and cheese. The sauce was not smooth and was spicy (not hot-spicy, but strong-flavored spicy). My kids were appalled by it and while my husband and I could eat it, we didn't really like it. Since I bought a case, we threw away the rest of the spice packets and made our own cheese blend for the rest of the pasta. I would suggest trying one bag from a local store first if you can, otherwise be aware that you may just be buying expensive pasta with useless spice packets if your family doesn't like this unusual flavor.",1
"I bought this tea because I was jealous of my husband's pumpkin coffee. It turns out, it is the perfect fall tea. It smells fantastic, and is full of the tastes of pumpkin spices. The only downside is that I had to wait about two weeks between placing the order and receiving the product.",4
"This tea is a disappointment because its flavours are weak.  It takes about double the amount suggested to brew a proper pot.  The packaging is green, but that does not make up for the weak tea inside.  If you do not like a strong, traditional bergamot flavour, then try this one.  You might like it, but I did not.",2
"This was a waste of money, the item was late, package was torn up,and the tea was terrible, not a good product in my opinion and bad handling.",1
This is the worst beef jerky I have ever tasted. It was not dried as expected and very mushy an tasted nothing like teryaki flavor that I purchased. I recommend staying away from this product.,1
"Back to Nature nuts are great the ones I really love are the almond, cashew and pistachios---not very salty just healthy nuts--I will buy them again and again.",5
"My last purchase of raw pumpkin seeds was from a different seller/brand and they were delicious. I went with this brand this time, mainly due to the price. The reason these are much less flavorful is because they have NO SALT. I understand that salt is unhealthy in large amounts, but I dont have a heart condition (yet) and I like a little salt on nuts.<br /><br />The seller needs to include important info like that so that people can know what they are getting. I will of course eat these, and they would go great in home made trail mix, but I will be salting the ones I eat by themselves.",3
"They make freezing and storing food super easy! Perfect portions, they stack on top of each other and food pops out of the soft shell with ease. Have them in every color! Worth every penny.",5
"So I am doing a low-carb diet and was really excited when I found out they made sugar free gummy bears...however, once I got them and tried a handful I got really bad diarrhea from them, not mention the gas from the sugar alcohol they use for sweetener... otherwise they do taste good and I cannot taste the difference from regular gummy bears but I don't think I would be buying them again anytime soon.",3
"Sad to say this tuna is no longer from Italy (as advertised) but from Thailand. I won't be ordering any more.<br /><br />09-03-2010 Taste tested it...no comparison to the moist, flavorful Italian tuna, this Thailand tuna is dry and bland in comparison.",1
Finally a strong cup of coffee.  I found that I had a lot of coffee grounds in the bottom of the cup.  Also some of the foil was misaligned allowing coffee grounds to spill throughout the box.,1
"The fist time that I bought a batch I was pleased because as a result of a review (I think) they were more careful with the selection.  The later purchase was not very good but still was not bad enough to make me give them a bad review and I decided to give them another try.  My las purchase was really, really bad.  They sent 7 Hazelnut DECAF (7 DECAF!!!! And of the same!!) and like 8 hot cocoa, so more than half the order was not coffe that I could use for my morning caffein rush.  I had never received more than 2 decaf and 2 of other (hot cocoa or tea). Do not buy, look for other seller, even if it's a little more expensive it will be a lot better purchase than this.",1
"If you have a dog labeled ""destructive when bored"" DO NOT pass up on this toy! It's absolutely the best puppysitter. It's been three months, but when I put her kibble in it I still know that she's good for about 20 minutes while I do dishes or whatever. I hate constantly kenneling her when I need to focus on something, so this has been wonderful because it lets her play so much longer.<br /><br />Pros-<br /><br />- Totally entertains her for a minimum of ten minutes<br /><br />- Can hold her dinner and then some, I can adjust her playtime with how much I put in it. The less I put in it the longer she plays<br /><br />- Easy to load treats in. just unscrew the bottom and you're good!",5
The shipping and price was amazing. I just found it too salty to cook a steak on though. Maybe I am just using it wrong though. I wish there was better directions. Nice bag though. Thing is beautiful.,2
"I ordered this tea from Amazon because I was having a difficult time finding anywhere to buy white tea in my area.  This tea has a very nice flavor.  I drink several cups of tea every day, and this one is one of my favorites!  I would highly recommend this tea to others looking for a nice flavored white tea.",4
"If you are a fan of Larabars like I am stick with the fruit bars. They are delicious. I ordered these without trying them and was very disappointed. They are dry and not the least bit sweet.  You do have to realize that you are not eating a candy bar, and that there is only 3-4 ingredients in most Larabars.  This works for the fruit flavors but not for this particular Larabar. I would not order them again.",1
"I already reviewed this on Amazon where someone was selling it for a high price (over $50) and now I think it was maybe for six boxes, though I didn't clearly see that on the advertisement. I paid $7.87 yesterday at Sam's Club for 35 oz box.  Had it for breakfast today.  Checked the box cause it seemed maybe stale.  Said best if used by Feb 16, 2011.  That is less than two weeks away from purchase date. Raisins are indeed like mini hockey pucks.  You could easily break a tooth on this cereal.  I wasn't crazy about the flavor.  I'll probably try it a couple of times more, but I doubt I'll like it enough to buy it again.",1
"This coffee arrived fast but when I went to shake the cup it was a big hard ball... they were all like that, I guess they are old and almost expired...This item is non returnable so I am just out the money. Don't buy from this seller.",1
"Just as a heads up to fellow Celiacs,I bought this product thinking it was the 'egg replacer' often referred to in gluten-free bread recipes. Sadly this product has wheat gluten as an ingrediant, so once again I'm in search of an online vendor for the GF egg replacer since Amazon has not had it in stock for months now.  This product works fine, thus the 3 stars, its just not what I had been looking for. I wish it had a different name to avoid confusion (egg substitute?) I've been slowly using it in baked good recipes for vegan friends.",3
"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1
"Wow, I tried this coffee and it was love at first taste for me !..lol..  It is rich, flavorable and strong, but not too strong.  It is the best coffe I have tasted in a long time. I use a hazlenut creamer and both flavors are great together.  Try this one. It is delicious !",5
"I ordered these because I wanted to try something new due to me being on a low carb diet.  I love slim jims, but these nach flavored ones are not for everyone.  Every time you take a bite, a burst of gooey, greasy cheese explodes in your mouth.  Not a sensation I enjoy.  Slim jims are greasy enough without having that extra ""oomph"" packed in.<br /><br />Ill give it an extra star  due to being able to bite around the cheese and eat the tasty slim jim w/ out the cheese.",2
"If you've got sensitive blood sugar, DO NOT eat Kind bars. They are certainly not Kind. I crashed on them a few times before I realized their ""glycemic index"" numbers were false and misleading.

"I absolutely love coffee!  And instant saves a ton of trouble and angst.  So, as opposed to other coffee afficianados, I'm not a snob who has a disdain for instant coffee.  In fact, I like it.  The trouble here is that the instant coffee is way too sweet.  Nearly four servings of sugar in the entire miniscule serving.  So, you get your joe, but you also get a helping of way too much sugar.",3

"I'm so glad you emailed.  I have been trying to find a way to communicate to you my total disappointment.  This is the second time I have ordered the Terra Gold Onion & Garlic (12 bags at $30). The first time they were great, exactly what I have tasted when buying single bags from the grocery.  This time they have virtually NO TASTE, they are small, broken chips and I am completely dissatisfied.  I called Terra Chips with no result, they said to contact Amazon.  I looked all over your web site to try to locate a place but couldn't find one. There was NO Sales Slip in the box. I really feel a refund is in order.",1

"Extremely tasty candy with a texture unlike anything on the candy shelves in America. Imagine, if you will, popping a piece of soft strawberry gum into your mouth and beginning to chew--the first few seconds are always the best, when you get a blast of intense strawberry flavor along with a firm, enjoyable chew, right? Then imagine that gum melting away gradually on your tongue, without losing any of its flavor, rather than enduring and just becoming stringy and bland. Very nice indeed.",5

I stumbled upon this product while surfing the Amazon website, and I thought I would give it a try based on other reviews.

"If you are even a semi-regular baker with recipes that call for candied fruit peel (or you happen to throw candied fruit peels into everything including your morning coffee and thai curry just because they taste good), you have also realized that the baking section in most grocery stores now consists of atrocious ""mixes"" where you ""just add water and bake"" or poisonous looking icing tubes. Even if you have the good luck to find a store which actually sells real candied fruit, the prices are more in line with those of Italian truffles. The candied diced lemon peel from Barry Farms is excellent quality, delicious and priced reasonably. I am coming back for more the moment I am done baking with the current box.",5
I have been feeding this dog food to ny dogs for two years without incident.<br /><br />I am so glad I read these reviews because recently I noticed the food looked different when I poured it into my dog's bowls. Soon afterwards I had several of my dogs coming down with recurring bouts of bloody diarrhea. I had no earthly idea what could have been causing the trouble. I just logged onto Amazon to see about automatic shipping of this food and discovered that this brand did in fact have a new fomula change (unbeknownst to me) and that others have been having the same bloody diarrhea in their dogs since the formula changed. I will never ever buy this dog food again! I will never recommend it again. End of story!,1

"I usually like to drink tea (and coffee) straight-up, and while this had a good strong tea flavor, the chocolate and spices were barely there.  After reading other reviews, I tried steeping for only 4 minutes and adding a splash of milk, which improved the overall flavor, but again it tasted like tea with a sweet-spicy scent, not ""chocolate-flavored"" tea.",4
"The name of the beverage is unmistakable--Switch. I guess it follows that ""Hope"" and ""Change"" slogan that was popular last summer and fall. The good news is this drink won't escalate the national deficit.<br /><br />I tried the black cherry variety. To be honest, I thought the 8.3 ounces was a bit sparse. I'm used to a full 12 ounces. I liked the cherry flavor. The carbonation was not over powering, just enough for a slight fizz.<br /><br />The product bills itself as all natural. No sweeteners were added, a good thing as my son gets enough in the line of sugars. But my son doesn't drink sodas and didn't want to try this. (More for dad, eh?) It claims to be 100% juice. Now the labeling can say one thing, but what does the required ""Nutrition Facts"" say? It does claim 33g of sugar (in an 8.3 ounce can). Since the bottle of Cherry Coke Zero doesn't even list sugar, I'm not sure how to take that information. Or is the sugar fructose from the cherry juice itself?<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the drink. I haven't seen it on the store shelves yet--but it is available at Amazon. Try it for a refreshing change.",4
"They are a healthier chip with less salt and fat, which I like better than the over-salted regular chips on the market.  The flavor is great and they are nice and crunchy. Absolutely worth a try!",5
"My 4lb. Chorkie is very picky. I get Newman's dry dog food, but she will only eat it if it is mixed with something. I should say, something that is like table food. She loves this! The real advantage is it is very healthy and nutritious, unlike many of the wet dog foods that I have bought. It does appear to look like human food. I suppose it is sad to admit that my adopted dog is so picky, but she is. Now I don't have to be concerned about her not eating or eating products that are not healthy.",5
"This orange soda is clearly more healthful, and it tastes tangier, although somewhat less sweet, than other orange sodas.  The one big drawback for me was that this drink lacks caffeine.",3
Now makes an excellant product and amazon provides it at a very good price with prompt delivery.  The trick to avoiding aftertaste with stevia powder is not to try to make the food too sweet.  1/16 of a teaspoon is enough for a 12 ounce cup of tea - sweet but not too sweet and no aftertaste.  Use 1/8 of a teaspoon in 12 oz. of tean and the tea will taste as sweet as soda pop and the aftertaste will still be around an hour later.<br /><br />I have been using this product as a sugar substitute for about a month (replacing aspartame - Equal) and recommend it without reservation.,5
"I purchased a combination package including this item via a Kindle Special Offer a couple of months ago.  The food was packaged well and tastes fine.

Once you've had a transaction with a company, they are ""allowed"" to contact you via phone (incessantly) for a period of 2 years after the last transaction, even if you are on the National No Call Registry.

"I've been trying to lose weight and have been using a meal replacement shake that comes in sweet cream flavor.  To jazz things up, I've been adding fruit, peanut butter, coffee, etc.  When I heard about PB2, I decided to give it a try.  The 6.5 oz sizes allow you to give the product a try before committing to a large quantity.  PB2 is very light and powdery.  It takes 2 Tbsp. (45 cal) to give a good peanut flavor.  The regular PB2 is better than the chocolate variety.  The chocolate flavor isn't very intense with more pronounced PB flavor.  It mixes well with the shake mix and tastes good.  The price is high considering the small number of servings you'd get per jar.  This was an ingenious way to make the by-product of pressing peanuts for oil into a valuable commodity!",4
I eat this daily. It isn't very sweet so I add a little Splenda when I mix it up. It tastes great on an english muffin.,4
Pleased with the product and the ease with which it was ordered.  Shipping time was really great.,5
I have been using this product for approximately 6 months and there is a definite change in my dogs.  Both of my dogs are older (9 and 11) so I wanted something to keep them feeling good and active.  My youngest has arthitis and this has helped to move around easier and he has more energy! I think this is one of the best hip and joint formulas I have tried. I would definitely recommend it.,4
Finally a bold coffee that is bold will good flavor as well. If you like a good strong but smooth coffee this is for you.,5
I loved the crunch in these protein supplements.  They are the lowest in calories from what I have been able to find.  Very tasty too.  Much like a wafer cookie.,4
"Wow.  This was awful.<br />You know how some barbeque sauces are sooo good you just can't stop eating.  Even when you're bursting and should stop?  Well, this one isn't it.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this one as we love Stone brewery and there was no high fructose corn syrup or any other unnatural sounding ingredients in it unlike Phil's which was another BBQ sauce sold at Costco - where we bought this jug.<br /><br />I took a chance and bought this to use it to make our 4th of July potluck contribution - shredded bbq chicken in the crock pot.  First I cooked chicken breasts in the slow cooker with chicken broth and then shredded it and put it back in the cooker and was about to add the Stone Levitation Ale Barbeque Sauce to it when I tasted it and thought ""Cr*p! This tastes awful and I'm going to have a LOT left over at the potluck.""<br /><br />But it gets four stars because it is easily doctored to taste good.  And then you're left with a good tasting sauce with fairly healthy ingredients.<br /><br />For those who, like me, thinks it's missing something and doesn't think it tastes good out of the bottle, my tip is to add sugar.  I added a couple TBS white sugar and about 1/3 cup brown sugar to the half jug of sauce I mixed in with the chicken.  Then I went online to look at bbq sauce recipes to see what else I could put it there.<br /><br />My research on the net got me adding a couple long squeezes of ketchup and about 1/4 cup Apple Cider Vinegar.  That did the trick.  It is tasting like a real bbq sauce now.  By the way, each time, I mixed the added ingredients with broth before adding it to the meat.  And of course, add to your taste!<br /><br />4 Stars for the doctored up version.  Next time I'll buy another brand or make my own from scratch.",4
"once again I purchased this candy to relive a childhood memory only to find that I could not eat this type of chocolate anymore, I had to give it away.<br />I wont be purchasing this product again.",3
"Good steaks, but too much bother when I can get the same thing in a local store for less cost, considering shipping etc.",3
"I'm a big chocolate fan, as well as baked goods in general. I read the reviews and thought this sounded great! The whole thing was very bitter. My two children wouldn't even eat it. I don't know if the one I received was just bad, but I would not recommend this.",2
"Thought it tastes funny.  Not like iced tea, not like lemonade and no where in between.  There are much better flavors out there",2
"Weruva appears to be a high-quality, human grade food.  My cats just love it!  My only gripe is when Amazon does not specifiy if it is cat food or dog food.  When they don't, it usually means its dog food, even when I do a specific search for ""Weruva canned cat food"".  And then the Amazon representative tries to tell my the cat and dog food is the same!  NOT!",4
"I enjoyed this coffee very much, but I think it's important to be clear about the details of the taste, and how to brew it for maximum enjoyment.First, this coffee has a full bodied flavor similar to French Roast. The taste of the coffee itself is deep & rich. As such, the vanilla flavor is subtle. It's not as ""prominent"" as flavored coffee you buy in the supermarket (that coffee tastes ""heavy & fake"" in the flavoring department). If that's how you like your coffee(with heavy flavoring and less ""coffee"") you will NOT enjoy this coffee. This isn't the cheap Vietnamese coffee that everyone's been drinking since most companies have stopped using Columbian coffee. Vietnamese has a very lightweight flavor (no ""body"") and takes on a much stronger taste with artificial flavoring.<br /><br />This coffee doesn't taste quite as good when percolated through an electric machine. It's still great...but the flavor gets diminished this way. Try a French Press or better yet, a ""pour through"" gadget (see the manual coffee maker below) made by Melitta... instead. This way of making it makes a coffee that...well....blew my socks off.<br /><br />For coffee addicts & lovers...you'll understand this coffee. For those who think Yuban is great, probably NOT. Personally, I loved it and will be back for more. I would have given it 5 stars if the taste was the same with electric brewing as it was with more ""rustic"" methods using boiling water. As it is..making it by the cup made alot of difference and that's why my review gives it 4 stars instead of 5. Most people will use an electric coffee maker, and depending upon the brand (Krups would probably be ok) it may be less than superb.<br /><br />This is the ideal pot to use for this coffee:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Melitta-Manual-Coffeemaker-10-Cup/dp/B000MIT2OK/ref=pd_sim_k_3<br /><br />I use the one cup size for myself, and that's handy for me.<br /><br />*This coffee is ground very fine and is ideal to use with a manual coffee maker.*",4
This coffee is absolutely wonderful if you like a strong full-bodied coffee that has no bitterness whatsoever and nothing but a wonderful deep coffee flavor. I was very pleasantly surprised the first time I ordered this amazing coffee and I have been buying it ever since. I have never been disappointed. It is truly bold and flavorful and when i serve it to friends they don't have a clue that it is decaf and most can't believe it until I show them the container!,5
"I was so excited to try a new BOLD coffee.....needless to say, I am disappointed. I would rate this coffee as a MEDIUM. If it would have been listed as a MEDIUM, I would have given it a higher rating because this is truly a MEDIUM strength coffee in taste and flavor. I will still drink it from time to time- flavor is smooth, not bitter. Overall, I wish that I would have ordered some more Jet Fuel or Black Tiger.",3
"My wife and I both found this to be quite bitter.  We both much prefer the Timothy's Italian Blend.

"After waiting a ridiculous amount of time for my case of 15 5oz bags to arrive, upon opening the box noticed that every bag had been chewed open by a mouse.  Don't know if it is still in the box, but it is outside on the porch.  When my son gets home, I'm going to have pictures taken and email to Amazon.  The outside Amazon box was intact, so it had to be either from the Kettle Chips people or the Amazon warehouse, don't know which.  I will never buy these again from Amazon.  I cannot tell you how disgusted I am with this purchase.  It makes me sick to think about it!<br /><br />I included pictures at the top of the page.  Poor little mousie must have high cholesterol now.<br /><br />Update:  I forgot to mention that I offered to email the above pictures of the mouse damage to Amazon but was told they didn't want them.",1
Welchs Fruit Snacks were okay but way to expensive. I found a differnt brand with the same amount of indiviual bags for a 1/3 the price. I won't buy this item again.,1
I bought this as a gift. The person who received it really likes the product,4
We love this coffee. It is all we buy now. BUT we can get it at Walmart in these 11oz bags for $4.78. The Amazon price is about double that.,5
Tried these and liked them. Tried OvaEasy when these were out of stock for so long and liked the OvaEasy much better. Tasted more like fresh eggs. Just my 2 cents.,2
"I Love these pancakes!they are Very Easy to make. My go to breakfast! Fast ,tasty and easy.  Two scoops makes 2 pancakes!!",5
"I purchased the Nutiva brand of extra virgin coconut oil because I'm exploring the paleo diet. I had used Spectrum brand from the supermarket before and loved it. It had no strong coconut taste or smell. But it was expensive ($9 for a 1-lb. jar).  So I got a big order of Nutiva coconut oil from Amazon. Unfortunately, it adds a strong coconut flavor to anything you cook with it or add it to. I like coconut in general, but a cooking fat should have a neutral flavor. I'm going back to Spectrum coconut oil if it's on Amazon.",2
"I recently picked up a can of this coffee at the local Walmart.  As a self confessed coffee fiend, I am always on the look out for something new and promising to try out my taste buds on.  Admitting that, who could resist something with a name like Black Silk.  No doubt about it, this dark blend is very rich tasting and smooth as many other reviewers have mentioned.  But unfortunately strong is not an attribute that I can attach to it.  Actually for something as dark and an finely ground as it is, it's my opinion that it quite surprisingly lacks a real wallop. Don't get me wrong, it brews a nice rich dark cup of coffee that is very smooth and almost devoid of any real bitterness.  But if you are expecting something as strong as the dark roast it is implies, I suggest you may want to look elsewhere.  It really is aptly named at Black Silk, for it is indeed wonderful smooth, but not at all that strong compared to other dark roasts I have tried.  Folgers Gourmet Blend as well as Melitta's dark roast are much stronger than this.  In conclusion, I recommend this for the discerning coffee drinker that prefers a smooth dark cup of coffee with a rich taste, but not too much belt in it to really pop you out of any bed in the morning...",4
I want to see a product label I can read!!! If I don't read...I don't buy. That danged thing is so small even ctrl plus can't make it readable.,1

"If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled ""lemon ginger green tea."" It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag.",3

"The other reviewers weren't kidding.  I could seriously eat this stuff with a spoon.  It's glorious.  I've stopped using Crisco and started using Nutiva Certified Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil in place of it.  I haven't found a recipe yet where it didn't work.  It does lend a coconut flavor to everything, so if coconut's not your thing, this may not be a great product for you.",5

"Since I have an assortment of dogs, I was delighted to review the dog treats. I gave them to three German Shepherds, a cocker Spaniel and a Rat-cha. I am glad to say I only had one that got loose bowels and only for one day. It was one of the German Shepherds. All the dogs seemed to enjoy the treats, for its rare that I give them rawhyde. Although the Rat-cha had some difficulty with the size of the product, the Cocker and Shepherds had no trouble at all. They appeared to have liked them with no other negative effects. Although I am sure they would appreciate another taste, I don't think that I will be purchasing the product.",3
the shipment must have had a very rough ride to my house as when it arrived every one of the bags were shaking down into a little ball . and the first 2 bags that I opened about 2 thirds of the chips were shattered . I communicated this to the vendor and they offered to credit 2 thirds of 2 bags.  I've been explained it was every bag in the shipment past 12 bags and they refused credit 2 thirds of 12 bags . I simply wanted a replacement of all 10 remaining bags and they said that they can only make a credit of the 2 bags . I am very dissatisfied .,1
Wonder why my review wasn't posted a few weeks ago?  This is the best rice but after ordering it and receiving it I was amazed to see it was for only 1 package.  Are you kidding???  over 6 dollars for 1 package.  It was my fault for not checking better but why hasn't anyone else complained about this?  So I am here to inform you all its only 1 package.,5
"This is tasty satisfying all natural honey candy. While that is fine in and of itself, if you have interstitial cystitis and are avoiding citric acid this is the only candy that I have found so far without citric acid or corn syrup which I am also avoiding.",5
"I recently purchased a case of these chips, thinking they'd be on par with their cousin, the blazin' hot, nacho tortilla chips...they were not. These chips did not have the classic 'stone ground' flavor, but neither were they billed as such...they were ok. The guacamole coating was severely lacking in zest. If they could have ramped-up the cheddar and sour cream flavors, which I couldn't detect at all, I might have been able to rate these as four stars. If you're going to order these chips, I'd advise you to have some savory dips standing by!",3
"Unless you read the fine print, you won't know that ""Turkey & Chicken Formula"" actually contains turkey, chicken AND whitefish.  Upon opening a can, you immediately get a hint of something fishy--perhaps this is why others have reported the food as ""contaminated"".  After just a single 5.5 oz can, my dog had a serious case of fish breath and by the next day was occasionally passing fishy-smelling gas.  Don't get me wrong---my dog loved this food, and I have read enough reviews to be satisfied that it's very good quality.  I have no doubt he would love to gobble down more of this (and I've got another 23 cans to get through), but I don't think my family will appreciate more of the fishy smell.",3
"This was another great find on Amazon Grocery!! They are very tasty, crunchy little cookies.  My family has really enjoyed these, they have a great mild chocolate taste and quite the crunch.  Most of the animal crackers/cookies that I've purchased for my family have become dismembered sometime before my children get them out of the package, these are mostly whole and you can really tell what the critter is before you pop it in your mouth ... Extra fun snack time for the little ones.  All in all, the box of cookies is well worth the price and I feel good about packing healthier snacks in my children's backpacks for school.",5
"I really wanted to love this coffee. I loved the Kona coffee I drank during trips to Hawaii, and I love dark roasts.  I saw SO many amazing reviews about this coffee on Amazon that I ordered some beans.<br /><br />They showed up, I threw them in my Bialetti and... ""ughhh"".... Nothing special at all...  So, I threw them into my Coffeemaker and.... ""ughhh"" again...<br /><br />A total waste of monty - well maybe not a total waste, at least I got a few cups of mediocre coffee for my money.",1
"The first time I drank Fenagreek Seed tea I did not like the smell or the taste very much.  I added a very small amount of Stevia to sweeten it.  The more I drank it, the more the taste grew on me.  It is now my favorite tea by a long shot!",5
"This product sounded so great. I started taking about two to four tbls. a day. After a week my lips started swelling, then the inside of my mouth started feeling strange and my tongue was very sensitive, then I started having what I thought was heartburn (which i never get) I would feel pressure in my thoart all the way down to my Solar plexis, By the end of the second week it became so intense I knew something was wrong with me, I just didn't know what. I thought ""I""m having an allergic reaction""(I'm not allergic to anything) so it took me awhile to catch on, the only new thing I added to my diet was the hemp hearts. I quite taking them, in one day  I started feeling better, by two days, started feeling normal again.<br />So just be careful, people can have an allergic reaction to this.",1

Although the Vienna has a plastic-like appearance, it is a very good machine overall. The crema is consistent, the frother works very well.<br />It will take some time to learn the proper combo of grinding size, dose,type of water and beans,but your espresso will turn out to the best of your expectation. If the machine is on sale, don't hesitate to buy it. Two friends of mine have had it for 7 years, and the quality of the coffee is still excellent.<br />My only complaint is the temperature of the coffee; it could be a bit higher, and I wish it had a cup warmer at the top.",4

"As one who likes sweet tea but not the calories that go with it, MIO Sweet Tea is a nice little treat.  For the curious, Sucralose (i.e., Splenda) is the artificial sweetener rather than Aspartame (i.e., NutraSweet) which is fine with me since the latter has a very bad aftertaste.  The best way to use this is to mix a small amount into water and ice and take a small taste.  Add more as needed until you get the right amount for your taste.  One warning is that you should stir thoroughly as it has a syrupy texture and does not seem to mix well otherwise.  But the taste is certainly good enough although one can find better teas out there.  The real problem is the steep price.  I can buy six gallons of very good sweet tea at the local convenience store for the list price of this mix.  Thus this might be an interesting idea but I am not sure it is worth the tradeoff.",3
"After purchasing different brands of pills and treats containing glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, I stumbled upon this brand. Initialy, I purchased their ""chews"". A short time later they discontinued the chews so I began purchasing the biscuits instead. They both contained much higher amounts of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate in comparison to other brands and my dog absolutely loves them. I no longer have to come up with creative ways to get her to take her medicine. I give her 3 biscuits a day each as a treat following her morning, afternoon and evening walks. I have to say that this is the ONLY product which has helped with her hip dysplasia. She no longer has audible clicks when she walks. I am disapointed that the company has discontinued the ""chews"" because they had higher levels of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate in them but am thankful they still carry the biscuits. This is a MUST have for my dog. The only thing keeping me from giving this product 5 stars is it is not as potent as the chews. Please bring them back!",4
"My toddler son always wanted to eat my full-sugar/additives Poptarts, so I found these as an alternative.  They aren't nearly as good as regular Poptarts, but they aren't horrible.  I think if I wasn't so addicted to sugar, I would like these more.",3
"Everyone in my family likes these -- including the children.  I used to buy them at Whole Foods, but then our local store stopped carrying them.  I was happy to find them here and at a reasonable price.  However I am reducing the rating because in the one case I have ordered so far the interior box was damaged; several of the cans were severely dented, and it was clear that it had happened before shipping.  (The outside box was intact.)  One reviewer said that her case contained many woody stems.  We have been lucky, I guess. We occasionally get a woodier stem, but overall the quality has been very good.  My only other complaint is that I wish Native Forest sold their hearts of palm in jars.  Nevertheless I am about to order our second case.",4
"In reading the reviews here it is obvious that different tastebuds are affected very differently.  At first I believed the tablets did nothing even though I used a whole one.  Bitter foods and drinks still tasted bitter to me.  Sweet foods and drinks didn't taste any sweeter.  I was prepared to write the whole thing off as placebo effect on the part of some people but the positive reviews made me try again.  It was when I drank pure lemon juice that I noticed a difference.  Pure lemon tasted like lemonade.  So the product does work, it just may not work exactly as advertised for you.",4
"My vet suggested this for my dog. I have a very elderly pet with lots of aches and pains and a few too many pounds. The vet thought it would satisfy the dog and help her slim down. I've always fedcher premium brands, but never tried a freeze-dried raw food product. The food comes dry in a re-closable plastic bag. I simply add water and let stand in the refrigerator for about 8 hours. I make about a 3-day batch at a time. My dogs (both) love it. They come rushing into the kitchen when I am mixing it up and practically inhale it when it is served.  It's not an unpleasant smell! The older dog did, in fact, lose some weight with no other changes in her routine. I can'tbe sure whether it's the food or the unfortunate wasting that occurs in 14-year-old dogs. Being lighter has been helpful for her joints, I'm sure. I go through a 20-lb bag every 3 weeks feeding 2 dogs(30lb and 47lb) twice a day. They like the turkey version also. Sometimes I add more water to make it on the soupy side. This is pricey stuff, but may be a bargain compared to the vet bills that an overweight dog can wrack-up.",5

"My 22-month old daughter has loved these ever since she started chewing her food.  They are tasty, healthy, and have zero additives.  On the downside, every few handfuls there is a pea that is as hard as a freaking ROCK.  I can barely crunch into it with my adult teeth, so I worry about what would happen if she really bites down on them with her baby teeth.  That being said, it's been months and nothing bad has happened...and it hasn't worried me enough to stop feeding her the peas, it's just something that I feel should be noted to those considering purchasing this otherwise excellent product.",4

"Thankfully I was able to wash these off and eat them.  I'm not sure what happened, but they were really salty and sour, like they forgot to put sugar in there somewhere.

"My kids asked ""How can you review bottled water?"" While most people think bottled water is a silly I will drink no water but bottled water. I even use bottled water for making tea or flavored drinks and even ice cubes. I have very sensitive tastes and could never stand tap water even as a child. The really funny thing is that when I was a kid in the mid eighties I would freeze and then boil water and put it glass bottles and I loved it. Weird huh? Well bottled water is now a multi-billion dollar industry. My favorites were Aqua-fina and Smart water.<br /><br />This Essentia water is the best of both of my other favorites, it is filtered using reverse osmosis which truly gives the purest taste of any type of filtering process and it also infused with electrolytes for real hydration much like Gatorade is with out the added sugar and artificial colors. It is also alkaline instead of acidic which is suppose to be very healthy for the body and decrease internal environment for disease.<br /><br />It is very fresh and pure tasting, no plastic after taste and no weird spring water taste or heavy mineral taste. This is my new favorite bottled water.",5
"OK, I can't stand these things, but my babies love them, so I gave it 2 stars, not one. First of all, it's just puffed corn, like Peanut Puffs, if you've had those by Envirokids.

For being ""all natural"" it sure does pack an unpleasant wallop! Watch out! Maybe the Honey Nut is better...",2
"I tried on three different occasions to get my two dogs to try these biscuits.  They just sniffed and turned away, both of them.  They are not fussy, so I was surprised, and I'm assuming that the teeth cleaning ingredient may not smell good to them.  They are a nice size for a small dog, and the smell (to me) is mild, but I can't judge how well they clean teeth if the dogs won't try them.",2

We usually use this when making rice (it works well with other grains too), and there are a number of features that I appreciate:<br />- no MSG (unlike the packets made by a competitor)<br />- I can vary the quantity based on how much rice or grain I'm cooking (unlike the packets made by a competitor)<br />- I can use with brown rice (and my kids think it is normal yellow rice!)",5
"I am not a huge potato chip fan so I was suprised by how much I love with these Lentil Chips!  They are light, healthy and absolutely delicious!  Also nice that they are Gluten Free and can be easily shared with my Gluten Free friends.  My kids also love them!  Favorite is Sea Salt & Cracked Pepper, but also like the Parmesan Garlic.  My father really likes the Cucumber Dill too.  Try them!  You'll love them too.",5
Purchased the limone biscotti for a Christmas present and the recipent really enjoyed it!  She said it was really crunchy with a good lemony flavor.  She loves it!  Thanks for making her Christmas special!!!,5
"These are decent treats to keep your dog busy for a while, but if the word ""everlasting"" is what's making you consider buying...move on.  I have two german shepherds.  They aren't mega chewers but enjoy a treat.  These things last about 10mins MAX with them.  I have two types of ""holders"" for the treats and the dogs manage to crack the treat part in a minute or two then just gnaw on it for a few more minutes until its done.  For the price they are asking on these, definitely get something else.",2
"I love the Udi's gluten free granola! I have had the plain and the cranberry flavors and they are both great. I have it for breakfast with my yogurt or as a snack right out of the bag. Definitely recommend this product. Clearly says on the bag everything it does not contain (like the big common allergens- gluten, egg, milk, nuts, etc.)...makes it easier than reading all the ingredients on every package. Delicious!!!",5
"I've been backyard sugarin for several years and this filter clears the syrup like nothing else and is reusable.  It is large and you do need to figure out a home set up, it's easy enough to use and washable/reusable.  Our syrup was the best it's ever been this year!  Filtering throughout the process is key and for $14, it's well worth the investment.  We set it over a coffee pot with spout, work in small batches so the syrup doesn't cool and you have a spout to fill jars.  You could use a cone colander/sieve/strainer as well, probably could pick up in an antique store cheap.",4
"This is a good product, my dog opened the doors twice and found the treat.  After the second time she just picked the toy up and turned it upside down till the treats fell out.  For a small dog it might work better",3
Normally when I take out treats or bones for my dog she starts doing her tricks right away and whining in anticipation.  When I take this box out she doesnt even get up. When I hand her a bone she lets it drop to the floor and just sniffs it.  Sometimes she'll eventually eat it. Other times she just walks away from it.  I will update my review after she's been using them for a while to report back whether her teeth are any cleaner.  That's assuming I can get her to eat them.,3
"The flavor of Roland's red quinoa is comparable to the flavor of white quinoa as the flavor of wild rice is comparable to the flavor of brown rice. Otherwise, they are the same. There is a little dust and stem matter in it though, despite that it is pre-rinsed. The resealable bag is very convenient. Overall, I recommend it despite the impurities, but will not buy it again because I actually prefer the mellow flavor of white quinoa.",4
"Normally I drink looseleaf tea, but there are times when I need the convenience of a tea bag.  This is a very serviceable flavored black tea in a bag. This has become my go-to bag when I need a quick cup of tea. The scent of this tea is utterly amazing- strong cinnamon, but not overwhelming. I could sniff the packet all day. Flavor is good for a bag. Most important to me is that the cinnamon flavor is present, but not so overwhelming that it is too sweet. All in all, a quality tea, great for when you need a bag.",4
"After reading other reviews on this mayo, I had to give it a try.  I grew up on Hellman's mayo, and as another review observed, you will probably prefer what you are used to.  Kewpie mayonnaise has its own distinct flavor, I can't exactly put my finger on what gives it its taste.  I want to try making some deviled eggs with it, I think it would give a nice twist on the flavor.  I also tried Duke's mayo, which is a lot like Hellman's, only with a more pronounced vinegar flavor.  I'm glad I tried both of these, I expect I will use up the Dukes, not sure about the Kewpie mayo.  It recommends using within one month after opening.  But ultimately, I think I'll end up staying with what I am used to, which is Hellman's.",4
"I have purchased this product in the past through Amazon for my twins and it was good. However, the last time I ordered the 6-pack in June, the cereal was stale and smelly. I opened a few cans and they were all the same. I called Amazon customer service and they were very helpful and gave me a refund. I don't think I will purchase this item again through Amazon, although I do purchase the majority of items for my twins(including diapers) at a great price from them.",1
It doesn't taste like white chocolate.  I wanted something like Starbucks so I could make my own white mocha and it is more clear and sweet instead of chocolatey..,1
My dog loves these treats and I love them because they are low calorie.  I was always worried when using other treats during training because I always felt as if I was giving him far too many calories.  Now I am able to extend my training lessons while feeling comfortable that I am not overfeeding him.  They also have a nice moist feeling that I am sure my dog loves.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product,5
"I was very disappointed in this purchase.  I was use to getting 3 16ct packs for this price of $23.99, not just 1 pack.  I returned this item for a refund.",1
"First, it arrived exactly in two days thanks to the prime shipping! So that's already a star there.<br /><br />Anyway, I adopted a cat recently who was a bit on the heavier side and a little bit older (3 years old). I wanted to give him the best food possible and wanted to make sure he would be happy and healthy. Also, the food that I was feeding him was the atrocious Walmart ""Special Kitty"" brand so anything was better than that.<br /><br />I didn't even need to transition my cat at all. The second I opened the package to feed him his first bowl he was all over me! Would NOT leave me alone until there was kibbles to be eaten in his bowl. Now whenever he hears me putting food in his bowl he comes running. He loves the stuff.<br /><br />He already seems more active and alert after just a couple days of eating this awesome food. The price wasn't too shabby either compared to other natural/holistic cat food brands.",5
"It sounded Good  I prepared it according to directions.  I really love ginger and even used to buy candied ginger.  This is why I was so surprised when I downed a gulp of this drink.  It was really sweet, but it hurt my throat. Then it had a horrible aftetaste like those old cans of Shasta used to have.  Water is better",1
My kids have been begging for hot cocoa k-cups and when I found these so reasonably priced I decided to give them a try.  We all loved them.,4
"I love ginger and love trying new teas, so I was excited to try this product.  This is an instant beverage mix that come in a pouch and can actually be served in two ways, either cold or hot.<br /><br />I choose to try this product hot, as a tea.  There was no steeping involved:  the instructions simply stated to add boiling water and then to serve immediately.  I did like the ginger flavor, but I think it was the lemon that gave this product and odd taste, sort of syrup-y and medicinal.<br /><br />In the end, as a hot beverage, this was just okay--drinkable, but that's about it.  I much prefer Yogi Tea's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3QLG"">Yogi Ginger, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> (they also make a Lemon Ginger for those who want the lemon flavor as well; I  prefer without, but Yogi's certainly does not have the odd taste of this tea).",3
"Didn't care for it. This is the only Earl Grey I have tried so I can't compare it to any other brands. I don't really think it is the brand though, I just don't think I like oil of bergamot. Any way, it tasted kind of bitter and soapy (no, my cup didn't have any soapy residue in it). Didn't finish the cup. There are several Taylors of Harrogate teas that I really like, this is not one of them.",2
"i have loved this product for years, and when I saw them on sale at Amazon, I jumped and placed an order.  It si very rare for Amazon to mess something up, but they did this time.  Their shipping method reduced the cookies to shards and crumbs.  You could never serve them in that condition.  But they make a fantastic crust.<br /><br />Lets face it, on this one item, Amazon completely dropped the ball on shipping.",1
"The Kenco discs have a smooth taste.  I would consider it to be on the mild side.  If you like breakfast blends, you would most likely like this coffee.  If you like a bold or earthy taste, pick one of the Starbucks bold blends or the Maxwell House French Roast discs.",4
Alvita changed their lea licorice tea not the same - but my daughter likes it.  She normally uses tea in her tea but she said she does not use tea in licorice tea - it is sweet enough.,4
"I like Kashi products overalls and loved this cereal at first. However, the consistensy is too hard. It caused, not one, but TWO major dental problems for me (a young woman in her thirties). One morning, I broke a filling eating my morning breakfast. Dismissing the problem, I then later broke a cap snacking on the cereal. Overall, my dental bill amounted to almost $2,000.<br /><br />My advice is that if you have any dental work at all, like most of us in the world, avoid this particular Kashi product unless you want a very large dental bill.",1
"I've never been a big fan of palak (spinach). However, the major problem with this item is that the palak gravy is too thin and the paneer tastes really bad.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the sodium level in this product is ridiculously high. I bought this product thinking that it would be slightly more healthy compared to other packed-food products but the high-sodium level ruined it.<br /><br />That said, some of the other products by this brand, for example 'dal bukhara' and 'rajma', taste much better. And if you are looking for healthy food, I guess you should be looking somewhere else. Buying some fresh vegetables at the local grocery store might be a good start in that regard.",2
I wouldn't say this is my favorite salt or even my favorite flur de sel as their are many.  It is a quality product and great value though.  The crystals are a little small and lack the crunch of some other flur de sel's I've tried.  Definitely worth keeping in the collection though.,4
"beware  - this is a spice mixture only, not actual harissa<br /><br />Not what I intended to order, but the ad wasn't clear.<br /><br />Harissa as I ate it in North Africa was a pulpy mash of peppers and spices, some oil. Fantastic stuff.<br /><br />I recommend Mustapha's Moroccan Harissa - it was terrific.",1
"Not bad, but we like Timothy's Midnight Magic and Green Mtn Dark Magic better! Please read my review under Timothy's Midnight Magic for in-depth comparison. Overall, not a bad cup, bitter smell, not as bold as the others listed above. In fact, I prefer the Diedrichs French Roast over it as well.<br /><br />#1 Timothy's Midnight Magic  (see review)<br />#2 Green Mtn Dark Magic  (Target)<br />#3 Diedrichs French Roast<br /><br />A lot of people seem to really love the Black Tiger based on the reviews, I have them sitting on the counter, but once my friends try the Midnight Magic from Timothy's, they never try anything else. Just my limited experience. :)",3
"This is a good product, but did not wow me. I prefer a 'clear' sauce to this milky colored variety. Don't be afraid to buy this as it does taste good, but I will try another brand next time for comparison. Its good.....but not great!",3
"It was my mistake that I did not recognize that these were mini bars.  They are maybe half the size of the bar you find in the store.  I paid $17 for 20 bars.  I now see that they are $25 for the same amount.  unless you need the small bars, i would not recommend buying these.",1
"I use a lot of energy drinks (Jack3d, redbull, assault..etc). This is the worst energy drink you can have. It is just awful. First the crashing afterwards is maximized. i had to sleep for 2 days straight after this. No other energy drinks do that. Redbull and jack3d and Monster are all great. Worst part is, I did not even get that much kick out of it. It is the worst drink you can buy.",1
"I did not want an extra bold coffee. This is not listed as extra bold, but that is what arrived at my door. Stuck with it, I've been drinking it, but not at all enjoying it. If you like extra bold, maybe you'll like this. Not me. Tastes like old coffee grinds to me.",3
These are OK but not as flavorful as I like.  Maybe it's just me.  My son tried them and liked them but they are not hazel nutty as I like.  I'll try again -- maybe the 1st cup was a dud.,3
"it does give the same boost as an energy drink, but i didn't lose any weight dure to this product",2
"Well, I was a little disappointed in these Twinings K-cups.  The reason being that while waiting for these guys to come in the mail I tried some normal Twinings english breakfast teabags beforehand.  The K-Cups still brew a decent cup of tea, although as you cannot control the steepage the tea comes out on the weak side for me.  While still tasty, the much greater expense ($0.45/cup vs less than half that for teabags) for the convenience may not add up for a lot of people. However, if you're go-go-go in the morning and don't have time it may be worthwhile.  I myself will be going back to teabags but will still use the Keurig to get fast hot water!  Best of both worlds!",3
"I would consider this to be good, every day Earl Grey, not particularly one you would treat yourself to on special occasions. Like most of Davidson's teas, it's good, not great. But, it's priced accordingly and that makes it a very good bargain for everyday use.",3
"The food itself is O.K. The cat eats it and gives it an average rating. She favors many other flavors over this.<br /><br />Seven of the cans were crushed on receipt, with 3 being totally popped open, and food from them strewn over all the other cans.<br />The box was not damaged. I have ordered cans several times from other vendors and never had more than 1 dented can on time. I will<br />NEVER, EVER use this particular vendor again. What a friggin mess of a shipment!",1
It is simple. These chips taste great and are a healthier alternative to other brands. Way better than anything baked! I highly recommend them!,5
"I first learned of this product in a unique pet store that sells foods for dogs and cats that are extraordinary.  These treats by Plato's Farmers Market are so pure that once you open the bag, the smells of raw fish and fresh vegetables fill the room!  I have three dogs and all three love these treats!  Dog lover's know that when one dog turns particular with taste, others will follow due to pack mentality!  However, these treats have been consistently appealing to these four footed ones of my  heart.  I have been feeding them these Plato treats for one year now and they are always enjoyable.  The ingredients are abundant with wholesome things, and probiotics to aid digestion.  They are not hard chews nor are they soft, so they appeal to dogs with all types of oral problems.  They are easily ground up for my little five pound poodle!  Excellent product with excellent results!  Thank you Amazon for offering these treats at a reduced price with free shipping!!",5
Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Spicy Ranchero Sauce has a very bold rich and spicy flavor. Goes great on Tacos and Fajitas or any food you might want to add kick to.,3
The following recommendation is based on having enjoyed over 100 tea varieties in the last 2+ years.<br /><br />This tea is a great caffeine free alternative. Try it.,4
After reading all the hype I was lured in to buying this so-called coffee.  Tastes like coffee grind recycled after first use.  The coffee we buy from local super market costs the same but tastes much better.,3
"The ad shows a picture of three packages with the caption ""80 bags per pack.""  I thought I was buying what was in the picture, three 80-pack boxes.  Silly me.  I should have known it was too good to be true. If I had scrolled down to the product description I would have known it was ONE box.  Oh well, fool me once, shame on me, ....... you know the rest.  BTW, the tea also arrive one day later than my two-day Prime membership promised.",2
Not as good as others that I've brought!~ Very Pricey and the bag does not seal that tight....I used a clip to keep it more air tight!~.......Not a fan!~,3
"We adore this oatmeal.  I was surprised at how good the ingredients list was and the taste is wonderful!  Large dried cherries, plenty of pistachios and I believe there are even almonds as well as multi-grains.  We reordered in different flavors hoping to find them as tasty.  We even ate it uncooked with milk...still yummy and quick as we are always running out the door to work, some class...whatever.  Great, quick breakfast item!",5
"We have been transitioning our 4 cats over from the crap Purina makes to Wellness, and for most of the flavors, they love it. They like it much better than Friskies. Yesterday was the first time we tried the Salmon and Trout flavor, and absolutely none of them would touch it. They left it in their dishes all day and went hungry.<br /><br />I'll still give it 3 stars, because overall Wellness is better than anything else out there. Just be sure to test out the different flavors on your cats before committing to any bulk orders.",3
I Love this brand....and please tell EVERYONE you know...Hemp oil is sooooo beneficial for you...do your research...you will understand that getting 3 Omegas and some,5
"The flavor of this coffee is average, in my opinion.  Tastes vary from person to person, and I am not partial to any one brand, I just didn't find this particular coffee to have any stand-out aspects.  It tasted fine, and I have no complaints.<br /><br />I will say, I did not find myself shaking from a caffeine let-down later after drinking it, so thankfully it's not as heavy on the caffeine as some coffees I've tried.<br /><br />I realize these pods are for a specific kind of machine, but I wanted to brew some coffee like tea with boiling water while on our camping trip.  Unlike other reviewers, I did not have any trouble with making a single serving mug - I simple pressed on the pod several times during brewing with the back of a spoon as it steeped in the mug with the water.  I had rich, dark coffee with very little fuss.",3
Very dissapointed in shipping. This is the second time I have ordered and all the cans are dented,2
Well what can you say about this wonderful food...I love it...While not the best for you ...it is great tasteing...Yummmy,5
"I bought this tea as I like blueberries, and Stash is known as making good teas.  However, when I first emptied the drink mix in the water the color was an odd green (not very appetizing).  Once I mixed the powder with water, the resulting tea had no real flavor.  I feel like I wasted my money and can't get a refund.",1
"When I opened the can I didn't like the way the product looked and smelled. Kinda reminded me of Alpo. However, I poured off the gravy and put the meat balls in marinara sauce. Then it was pretty good. Reminded me of the meatballs in Franco American speghetti and meatballs. But not a mystery meat.. so it was good.",3
"This is the worst green tea I have ever had. Don't be fooled by the pristine picture on the packaging. This tea is made in China--I doubt where this tea is grown looks anything like the picture. I try not to buy food products from China considering how polluted it is. This may be ""organic"" but the water and air in China is toxic so it doesnt really matter. The taste is all off and it leaves a sour/bitter taste in your mouth. The tea bags are made of a cheap brown material. Overall this product is bad.",1
"I bought this item for my in-laws for Christmas as they don't drink caffinated beverages. It arrived and at least half were not decaf. One actually said on the label ""Contains Caffeine"". So, I contacted Amazon and they sent another, free of charge, over night. It arrived and 4 of them were not decaf. Be careful to check that you get what you ordered.",2
"This great product from Folgers ought to be available in every grocery store in the country.  If you want to drink more than one cup of coffee a day, or if you are afraid of too much caffeine, this is the coffee for you.  NO upset stomach, No acid reflux, and just good smooth flavor in every cup.  The smaller tubs of coffee stay much fresher than the big cans.  And the price is right for this pack of 6.",5
"I ordered this item which came in a flat rate USPS box.  I got an Identical box from another vendor.  My purchase from Online Candy Store was $29 with $35 shipping.  The identical flat rate box from another vendor was $9.80 shipping.  There is something seriously wrong with this kind of service.  NOT WORTH THE PRICE, DO NOT RECOMMEND ORDERING FROM THIS SITE. If I had not given this as a gift, I would have returned it.",1
"The aroma is pleasant, and flavor is nice and smooth, but it is very, very weak.  I really wanted to like this one as there are very few available on subscribe and save, but I just cannot recommend it.  Even making smaller cups it is very weak.  I'm going to stick to Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold as my go to k-cup for now.",2
"I have not yet received my order but have eaten these delicious treats.  So, I am sure that they will be enjoyable.  However, the shipping fee of $11.99 for this small order is outrageous and I know that Amazon has negotiated very good rates with their selected courier carrier and I cannot believe that the shipping and handling fee is as high as the cost that is being passed on to your customers.  This fee seems to be a new source of revenue for on-line companies...I wanted four boxes of these sweets and chose not to purchase this number since the S & H fee was even more expensive.",4
"The couscous both smelled, then tasted horribly of old & musty grain. It was terrible. What a waste now that I have to toss 2 entire jars. Honest to goodness it smelled & tasted like it was pulled from a trash can. What a disappointment. I must have been crazy to even try to cook it after the overwhelming smell after opening. :/",1

"My twins love oatmeal mixed with their food.  I couldn't find organic at our local supermarket so I tried this brand online and they didn't care for the taste (we managed to choke it down with smaller amounts mixed in), but I then found organic gerber which they love!  I can mix the gerber with a little juice and water and they love it.  I would not purchase this brand of oatmeal or cereal again.  The only thing good about it is that it is organic.",2
"We found very little peach flavor in this ""peach tea"".  It is a poor substitute for Twinings.",2
"While my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog food, for some reason their itching increased when I tried the lamb and rice. I have some very itchy dogs and am giving them a limited ingredient dog food to try to help. The duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly, but when we tried lamb and rice they started itching more once again. I like Natural Balance for the quality ingredients.",3
"I was disappointed that Santo Tomas Paella Rice had a high percentage of broken rice pieces. Broken rice cooks faster than intact rice, so this offering of Santo Tomas Paella Rice resulted in a mushy consistency. At first Santo Tomas seems a bargain, but add in shipping costs and you'll get better for the same price. You can find alternative rice for Paella on Amazon for $2.95 (16 oz.). <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000ICLJA"">C & F Arroz Valencia Short Grain Rice for Paella, 1 lb</a>. Or look at your supermarket for Arroz Valenciano or Arroz Perla from Iberia or Goya. Both offer a better quality of rice than Santo Tomas.",2
"Buttermilk is essential to many recipes.  But, keeping a supply handy in the refrigerator invariably leads to throwing the majority of it away due to spoilage.  I had high hopes for this Saco Cultured Buttermilk Blend as a means of avoiding that problem.  Unfortunately, I have to say that the product doesn't meet my expectations.  I agree that it adds a certain flavor and a bit of loft to a recipe.  But, I don't think it's quite the same flavor or loft I get from real buttermilk (or what passes for real buttermilk, these days).  The flavor is OK:  it's just different.  Also, I think the loft is more from the fact that the batters it produces are runnier (or maybe looser) than I get from buttermilk.  That's probably because today's buttermilk has some form of gum added which thicken things up.  Since the end result of recipes made with this differ from that of using buttermilk, it's probably just as good to use the old standby of adding a tablespoon of white vinegar to a cup of milk.  The result will be different from real buttermilk, but just as equivalent as using this powdered buttermilk.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend trying this product for yourself to see if it meets your needs.  It's certainly not bad, and could be just fine for you.  But, in my case, I guess I'll just have to accept the spoilage of buttermilk in the refrigerator.  I rate this at an OK 3 stars out of 5.",3
"The coffee is ok, nothing special.  I will like to find this product at a better price.",3

"I purchased 3 containers of this cereal all having expiration dates in 2012.  The first container I opened seemed fine (at least I hope it is! I fed it to my 5 month old!) The cereal color was a pale whitish-tan and there was relatively no odor to it.  Baby likes it so I am happy.  The second container I opened (again, same packaging, and good expiration date) had a totally different color - this time it was brownish-green. However, the worst part was the rancid smell.  It smells like rancid oil.  I opened the third container - same brownish-green color and and same rancid smell.  Very unhappy with this product.  I have contacted the company, but have had no reply yet.  I would not recommend feeding this to your baby.",1
"We've been feeding these to our dogs for about a month now and one thing is clear, they love them! We give them as recommended on the package, twice per day for each dog.

Not so for these.<br /><br />I recommend getting subscribed on a monthly basis if you want to save money.<br /><br />Big Red",4

"This is my favorite coffee.  I love coffee, but cheap coffee gives me heart burn, this does not.  When ever I have visitors they always say my coffee tastes great.  It doesn't have a bitter taste like some of the less expensive coffees.  If you like the coffee you get at nice hotels on vacation, this is what you are looking for.  We have moved and I can't find this brand here so I'm glad I can get it on Amazon.",5
"I cannot get enough of this stuff.  I have this stuff in my kitchen all the time.  To me, it's the best Granola cereal out there.",5
"My dad got an assortment of these to give as a silly little Christmas gift for us (we are adults now).  I really wasn't expecting much from them, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The flavors are mild, but good tasting and not sickly sweet.  Similarly, the carbonation turns out to have a pleasant effect rather than the gut-busting feeling you get from drinking soda.  I was also happy to see that it is sweetened with sucralose rather than sugar or aspartame.  The only drawback is the sodium content (contained in the compounds that create the carbonation.)  One other thing to note is that one tablet is for 6 ounces of water, so you will likely need to use 2 or 3 tablets for a ""normal"" glass or bottle of water.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say that if you are a soda drinker, you will find these disappointing since the flavors and carbonation are mild.  However, as an alternative to Crystal Lite, Kool-Ade (which I can't stand) or plain water, these are fun and make a good drink.",4
"FDA just issued yet another warning for dog chicken jerky treats made in CHINA..... dog lovers, you NEED TO PAY ATTENTION!!!! We just threw our stuff in the trash......Yet another health article appeared on CNN online re: dog chicken jerky treats. I re-read the reviews on Amazon. I contacted Dogswell customer service and got a lengthy, very informative reply that said, "" A large number of our products are sourced and manufactured in the United States and only a small number of our treats, are made in China."" (My package clearly states made in CHINA --- so, did I buy that ""small number"" of bags??). I carefully weighed all the information and still do not feel comfortable. I believe the manufacturer cares a lot about dogs but how about keeping the business right here in the USA?<br /><br />We just made the decision to stop ordering this product. Yes, my dogs like the treats but I cannot, in my heart, say I can serve them to my pups. I am unconvinced that this is the best option for my dogs.",1
These are greasy and not very good.  I suppose some people may like it but I  left them in our work break room so others would take them down.  They are beef and not a pork mixture so that's good for people who don't eat pork.,2
"This winter cocoa pocky is amazing and so much better than regular chocolate pocky, which is also great in its own way.  The chocolate tastes similar to that of regular chocolate pocky, but is much thicker and creamier and all around about 10x more amazing.  It's kind of like a perfect blend of milk and dark chocolate and has a tiny bit of powdered cocoa on the outside.  In the box, there's 4 individual packets with 6 sticks of pocky each, 24 total, so it's perfect for sharing or, you know, not.  The only thing you'll hate about this product is when it's gone and then you have to go get some more.  This pocky is a must try for pocky lovers or even people who've never heard of pocky before.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!",5
"I have seen two types of cherry juice concentrate for sale: tart cherry concentrate and black cherry concentrate. Both have their ""benefits"", but tart cherry concentrate seems to be the better product.<br /><br />Neither the tart cherry nor the black cherry taste much like fresh cherries. They both have a hint of over-rip fruit. The tart cherry is tart (dah). Reminds me kinda of cranberry juice (sort of).<br /><br />The directions call for a mix of 6 parts water to 1 part concentrate. This mixture is too strong for me. I like mixing 20 or so to 1 in a quart bottle and allow it to chill over night. I drink the quart over the course of the day.<br /><br />It seem to work and I feel better.",4
"Aspertame causes alot of problems including preventing weight loss<br />It gives me a headache and causes my Mom's blood pressure to go up<br />I would rather get it with out any sweetner added or have honey in it.<br /><br />The FDA knows it's poison and denies it.<br /><br />I don't like to see people being hurt by the lies concerning what they eat and drink.<br /><br />We should get in the habit of researching all ingredients in what we eat the less ingredients the better.<br />I hope this helps someone, if you drink sugar substitute and feel bad it could be the culprit.<br /><br />msg is another bad one.",1
"I recently received a soda stream, and have been playing around with the flavors. What I find is that everyone has their own amount of syrup they like added to the bottle. For example, with the cream soda I had to use about half the recommended amount, but with the diet root beer I like to add more mix. The real thing with these flavors - you just have to try them. I really like the diet cranberry, diet grapefruit and the diet root beer is literally the best soda I've ever had - diet or non-diet. Some others I didn't like so much. The cola didn't really do it for me, and I'm on the fence over the ginger ale. There is a bit of an after taste on the sodas, but they do have a lower calorie count (even the non-diets) than regular sodas. All in all I like the soda stream, it's fun, but I still buy Coke and some other sodas. I am looking forward to trying some more of the exotic soda stream flavors (BBB has almost all of them in stock) and playing with making my own.<br /><br />3 stars because... well, win some, lose some with the flavors. It's all subject to taste.",3

Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds are really enjoyable.  I love the vanilla taste.  They are great right out of the bag or sprinkled on yogurt.  I confess - I did not sprinkle - I added mass quantities.  They are also good as a cereal or oatmeal topper with soy or flax milk added.  They are not gaggy sweet like granola bars.  Perfect texture too!  I highly recommend this product and will be purchasing more.,5
"Love the product, hate the shipper!  I discovered the coconut M&M's at a car wash and fell in love. My friends & I went on a hunt and were so pleased to find them on Amazon. I've ordered them before without a problem.  This time was a disaster!  The outside box was fine, but inside was a mess.  Most of the individual packages were not fully sealed resulting in unprotected, squashed &/or melted candy.  I returned them immediately and am awaiting a refund.  Although other reviewers mentioned this as an issue, I had to give it a shot.  What a disappointment!!",2
"I got one box, inside are 3 packages of crackers, in my house, we call graham crackers ""cookies"". since we have one toddler at home, and graham crackers are one of the few treats he is allowed to have on a regular basis.<br /><br />The texture is very crisp, it reminded me of the crispness of almond windmill cookies.<br />I found the taste of honey to be very mild, I could not taste the cinnamon at all. The crackers are very sweet and in addition to honey are sweetened with evaporated cane juice, which is apparently another name for sugar:<br /><br />Evaporated cane juice is a loosely defined term which can include combinations of sugars including fructose, glucose and white sugar (sucrose). It is perceived to be less processed than white sugar, leading some to claim it is healthier.[1] However, nutritional benefits are minimal; evaporated cane juice can contain trace amounts of vitamins and minerals but has the same amount of calories as table sugar[2] and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration defines evaporated cane juice as any sweetener derived from sugar cane syrup,[3] and therefore it might be heavily processed. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that ""evaporated cane juice"" not be listed as an ingredient on food labels because it is not a commonly used name and does not meet the USDA definition of ""juice"".[3]<br /><br />The crackers are also sweetened with brown rice syrup:<br />Brown rice syrup, also known as rice syrup, is a sweetener derived by culturing cooked rice with enzymes (usually from dried barley sprouts) to break down the starches, then straining off the liquid and reducing it by cooking until the desired consistency is reached. The final product is 45% maltose, 3% glucose, and 52% maltotriose[1].<br /><br />The rolled oats on top of the crackers don't do much for the taste, and in my opinion make the crackers taste dry. The oats do seem to add to the fiber content, since a serving (2 full cracker sheets) has 2 grams of fiber.<br /><br />The package is made of recycled cardboard, and printed with vegetable inks, which is a plus, but the crackers are ""all natural"" which is a rather vague term, and none of the ingredients are identified as organic.<br /><br />If these were organic, or at least non-gmo, they would be worth the higher price because of the texture. But as just another cracker, they are not worth the premium price.",4
I have used other seasonings by Chef Prudhomme that were Ok. But this one was a little disappointing for me. I passed it on to a friend to get their opinion.,2
Very disappointing. I was expecting black olives. These taste like brown colored off flavor green olives. Never again. Should work ok in a salad but definatly not what I was expecting.,2
"Although this seems like a great product it is definitely not minced.  The cans say it is minced but it isn't, it is ground beef.  My cat ONLY likes minced.  Not chunks, not ground.  Although she will eat ground cat food sometimes, it has to be inviting and delicious, yet she just walks away from this.<br /><br />I hate it when the packaging lies about the contents of a product.  The shipping was speedy and the value is great (as long as they deliver what the promise) now I am stuck with food my cat wont eat at all.",2
"This has to be the worst sugar free product I have ever bought. This is not a syrup, Torani should check the meaning of syrup it is supposed to be thick not runny like water. They should improve the taste as well.",1
"This flavor is the best of the bunch by far.  I am reluctantly on a diet that allows for a few almonds as a snack.  I tried these and I was hooked.  Unfortunately, most stores do not carry this flavor.  My first case went very quickly, as every co-worker who tried them wanted a can of their own.  I recommend them to anyone, not only those of us trying to stick to a diet that deprives us of less healthy snacks.",5
This is pretty good -  I would buy it again...the flavor is not over powering. I don't like real strong coffee so this worked for me.. It is not my favorite.,3

I have used this tea for 2 of my 3 pregnancies. It's a little hard to 1st get used to the taste but now I love it. It helps strengthen the uterus. I started drinking it in my 3rd trimester and drank it for a few weeks postpartum as well.,5
Do not like the taste of this product. Wanted Vanilla and was talked into French Vanilla. Definitely a different taste. I still haven't adjusted to it. sorry I bought it.,2
I bought several items of the sprout brand but it seems like my daughter doesn't like this product at all.  The garlic in it is too overwhelming.  Each time I tried to feed her this she threw up.  Now I'm stuck with additional packets of this.  I do recommend the creamy chicken though.,2
"I used Cavenders Greek seasoning for the first time several years ago when my sister sent me 2-8 oz. containers as part of a birthday gift.  It is one of the best, most useful and prolific gifts I have ever received.  I use this seasoning on chicken, beef, pork and seafood dishes and in soups and stews as well.  This is one of the best seasonings I have ever used.  I refuse to cook without it. I use the salt free Cavenders as often as I use the Cavenders with salt.  Whatever your choice,I suggest that everyone who wants to pump up the flavor of their foods try this seasoing and like me, you will make it a staple in your household.",5
"About 5 years ago I discovered the ""secret"" to better baking -- parchment paper.  This little kitchen miracle worker makes baking so much easier and healthier.  No more having to grease cookie sheets or clean up the mess from a pecan pie that ""bubbled over"" when cooking.  A piece of parchment paper does the trick while keeping unecessary fats and calories out of your foods!<br /><br />The one problem with parchment paper is the variety you find in most stores is 1)  Expensive and 2)  bleached with chemicals.  ""If You Care"" has solved both of those problems in this 4-pack of parchment paper that your kitchen will love (hint:  it also makes a GREAT gift for a friend who is into cooking -- trust me!).  For the price you will pay for 4 boxes of this parchment paper you will get over 8 times as much as you would have gotten in the grocery store!  Plus you can rest easy knowing you aren't harming the environment by using paper that was bleached (can someone tell me what the purpose is to bleaching parchment paper -- it just seems silly!)<br /><br />I can't stop recommending this paper enough.  This is my 4th purchase from Amazon over the years of this exact same paper and while you may think that 4 boxes is a lot -- trust me, it will get used!  Once you discover how much easier it makes cooking you will be using it for everything!",5
These were very reasonably priced compared to other k-cups which is why I tried them. Not as strong in flavor but still very good. Will buy them again.,4
"The big nut bars are a pretty tasty alternative from Planters- I counted no less than 5 almonds in my bar.  However, as others have noted, the caloric count is pretty high for such a small bar.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they're also very sweet still, and I was looking for a more nutty bar with fewer sugars.  Additionally, much of the bar is taken up by filler ""rice"".<br /><br />Actually, I prefer the Planter's Double Nut flavor, because it has a better contrasting flavor of salty/sweet.",4

"These treats are natural, which is good if you're looking for that sort of thing. I was a bit skeptical because our hound mutt wasn't a big fan of the Natural Balance dog food (we've since switched her to Blue Buffalo which she loves - I think she mostly wasn't a fan of the fish flavor). So I was skeptical of a natural doggie treat.<br /><br />These a pretty good sized treats. They are scored down the middle, so you could theoretically break it in two for a smaller treat or smaller dog. They are pretty hard and pretty dry though, so it might be tough. If you have a dog with gum or tooth problems, this is definitely not the treat for you.<br /><br />But the most important thing is that the dog likes them. Not as much as a plain ol' fake Milk Bone or some of her other stuff, but she definitely likes them.",4

"I don't like sweet potatoes but I do like sweet potato fries.  I love these Popchips Sweet Potato Chips, they are very tasty.  There isn't a lot of salt, fat, or carbs.  My only complaint is each bag only contains .8 ounces, but I guess they wanted the bag to be exactly 100 calories.<br /><br />The rest of the Popchips line is great too.  Not fried or baked, and reasonably healthy.",5
"I've had hemp seeds before, purchased at my local natural foods market (navitas brand, I believe) and enjoyed it very much.  In contrast, Nutiva in the 5 lb bag, was disappointing to say the least.  Poor taste, plus a horrible burn all the way down my throat.  I'm not allergic to hemp, in fact consume hemp milk every day, so this was quite a surprise.  Unfortunately I did not keep the packaging, since I had immediately transferred the seeds to glass containers to prepare for freezing.  These seeds are going in the compost bin (hope it doesn't burn the worms!)",1

"I love this stuff! I add sugar and half and half and get a drink that is very much like Starbucks Chai Latte. The price on the product has gone up since I ordered it on Jan. 7th 2011 -- so, I ordered the CS Indian Spice Chai tea bags instead. I put 2 teabags in MY K-Cup and it tastes exactly the same. You get 6 boxes of 20, so that is 60 servings for me (2 bags at a time) for the 13.95 (subscribe and save) these cups used to be. If I want the tea a bit stronger, I will remove the tea bags after brewing from the my k-cup and throw them in my mug. Let is steep a bit longer and it is wonderful!",5
"These just taste like hot sweet apple juice. There is no cider component to the flavor at all. Rather than having a tart apple flavor with cider spices, the flavor is too sweet and rather flat.",1
It was a great value and I like the package size but not vinegary enough for me. Won't order this brand again. Great chips otherwise.,2
You can buy the same formula at Wal-mart for the same price without paying shipping charges.  Or at Babies R Us for even cheaper.,1
"I gave this for a Christmas gift to my daughter and son-in-law, who were both children in the 70's.  They loved it.

I will use it again as a gift for other children and relatives.",5
"This is my opinion. I was hoping that it would taste like a knock off Mountain Dew. Much to my surprise it tasted like an energy drink. If you think Mountain Dew and Red Bull taste the same you are nuts. I am not a fan to the taste of energy drinks that is the reason of the low score. To finish the bottle I have mixing it with Jagermeister. I do enjoy there other energy flavor <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VOOQKA"">MIO Black Cherry, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>. My wife and I use this flavor the most.",2
"IN A NUTSHELL: EACH PACKAGE CONTAINED 2 OZ. OF FRESH PEANUTS OR CASHEWS<br /><br />These 2 oz. packages are filled with fresh nuts with nothing but salt added [& peanut oil or cottonseed oil]. As snack foods go, this is a very healthy choice. Although expensive on an ounce for ounce basis, as portions of snack foods go, this is still a fair value and a relatively healthy choice. Bear in mind that about 75% of the 170 calories per ounce are from fat, but there are NO TRANS-FATTY ACIDS or CHOLESTEROL while there are some healthy mono-saturated oils.<br /><br />My big complaint against many other snack-nut products is their lack of freshness, and in fact a rancid taste to the nuts which NEVER happened with these Planters nuts. In fact, each individual package has an expiration date clearly marked on the front of the package.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: I PREFER THE LARGER JAR BECAUSE I EAT MORE THAN 2 OZ. AT A TIME<br /><br />My preference is to get these peanuts and cashews in the larger jar and unsalted, but for the summer, the salt is okay and the freshness was consistent in every package.<br /><br />For product info, Kraft has a website [plantersdotcom]<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]",4
"Foil bag was torn, but you couldn't tell!<br />opened the bag, it ripped much too far, coffee emptied everwhere!<br />That as it turned out was no big deal,<br />it tasted like really really old coffee with almond flavor-ugh, dumped it.<br />I never throw coffee away.<br />The vendor also charged me over 2x the price,<br />that was lots of fun to sort out.<br />All in all I wish I hadn't bothered.",1
"Like so many other reviewers have noted, the cookies I received had melted chocolate that had hardened all over them. The cookies were stuck together, so I couldn't truly indulge in the flavor - some bites were pure cookie, some were pure chocolate.<br /><br />These cookies were a bit tasty - the ginger and chocolate fit well together. The texture, like so many gluten-free products, was disappointing. They were very mealy, gritty - almost sandy. Not the fault of the cookie, but the problem that every gluten free product has due to the flours that are used (rice, tapioca, etc).<br /><br />The cookies were just a little chewy, which made me wonder if they were stale or if they're just not supposed to be crunchy. The chocolate was very good, high quality chocolate, which was a nice touch.<br /><br />These aren't cookies I'd keep in my house all the time, but they weren't bad. My main issue was the condition in which they were delivered, which was disappointing.",3
"I've always loved the original Keebler Club Crackers, and these taste almost as good, but not as ""buttery"". They arrived in good condition (ie, not much breakage, unlike another brand of crackers that arrived in the same box, which were mostly DOA.) If you like the original, you'll probably like these if you're looking for a wholegrain substitute for the original.",4
"Mixed reviews for this product. Some people liked it very much, some of them hated it. When i first tried it, they tasted horrible. But somehow I liked it when i had them the next time. Very light, flavored, spicy. The texture on the chips look good, but the after taste is not that great. That was my review. But a couple of my colleagues liked them so much that they had 2 bags of it at once. they loved the taste, flavor and also the after taste. 100 cal per bag with 0 cholesterol, not a bad bet!",3
I first bought this product because I work long hours in clinic and often am unable to go out and grab a fresh cup of coffee.  While it does not replace fresh brewed it does have a much bolder flavor than many of the other instant coffees available.  I do not think that it tastes the same as starbucks brewed coffee but it is good for a quick fix when you just can't get out.,4
"Had this been labeled ""green tea with a touch of pomegranate and raspberry essence"" I might have rated this higher.  However, the name is pomegranate raspberry and I therefore expected those vary flavors.  The overall taste is mild and muddled.  I except a greater sweetness.  The tea's second ingredient, chamomile, has a distinctive presence.  While I didn't find the flavor to be unpleasant, there is nothing about it that would make me reach for it over one of my other teas.",3
"****<br /><br />For several years I have been seriously studying various bottled waters, and after researching this particular one quite thoroughly I have reached a number of conclusions, which I will now reveal for free despite the fact these tests have cost me a lot of time and money over the years.<br /><br />First, it's mostly water.  In fact, it is for all practical purposes all water.<br /><br />According to my high-quality, thoroughly calibrated pH meter, which I reviewed elsewhere, the alkalinity of this particular bottle of water is much closer to 9.3 than 9.5, but that's only 2.105% lower, which I think makes no difference unless you drink dozens of gallons a day and dozens more a night, which if you do might come you down with hyponatremia.<br /><br />This water has a particular taste both in the mouth during drinking and afterwards.  Unlike trying to describe exactly how a wine tastes - ""An insouciant trace of dried foxglove petals masked almost but not completely by overarching reminiscences of the mature essences of oak barrels and lightly smoked hedgehog droppings,"" you know what I mean - trying to describe how the product under review tastes is simpler.<br /><br />Water.<br /><br />It tastes like water.<br /><br />It tastes like water as you're drinking it.<br /><br />After you've finished drinking some and you wait awhile to see whether there's any degree of afterbirth, there isn't.  It's exactly as though you had drunk water.  Which you had.<br /><br />****<br /><br />It freezes at 31.875 degrees Fahrenheit.  It boils at 210.77 degrees, not the 212 you might have expected, because I conducted the testing at 720 feet above MSL, but the point is that the boiling point of pure water at 720 feet up is 210.76 degrees.<br /><br />****<br /><br />It puts out a campfire just as well as tap water, and it puts out a campfire just as well as bottled water that doesn't contain sodium bicarbonate (baking soda, which is alkaline, which raises the pH level), dipotassium phosphate (derived exclusively from meteorites), magnesium sulfate (found only in certain caves in the Lesser Antilles islands), and calcium chloride (essence of limestone).<br /><br />****<br /><br />Amazon Vine Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water, 1.5 Liter, (Pack of 12), when bought in that quantity, amounts to 18 liters of water, which is 4.7551 gallons if you merely type ""18 liters in gallons "" into Google, which weighs 39.701 pounds, which is extremely close to the 39 pounds 11 ounces you would expect from pure water according to Wolfram when you enter ""18 liters water in pounds.""<br /><br />It works well in a squirt gun, which I still think more people should carry around just in case.<br /><br />At room temperature Essentia works well as a rinse after you've shampooed your hamster or your parakeet, and it works just as well after you've shampooed your giraffe but it takes a lot more, which gets expensive compared to just using tap water through a garden hose, believe you me.  For this I subtract one star.<br /><br />****",4

"I bought this particular canned Pedigree dog food from Petco for my dog, a spayed female corgi. Before trying Pedigree, we were feeding her Science Diet dry food. I bought a 12 pack of the ones with beef and ones with country stew. It was cheap (&lt;$1/can).<br /><br />Within a few days of feeding her the wet food mixed with some Science Diet dry food, her vagina started smelling strongly like fish. A few more days went by and thick bits of mucous were appearing on the fur around her vagina. One time I saw her pooping and at the same time saw a thick rope of mucous drop from her vagina. A few more days later, her fur around the vagina was tinged pink and later became red. It was evident to us there was mucous and some blood coming out of her vagina. So we stopped feeding Pedigree and went back to just the dry Science diet food. In a few days her excessive vaginal mucous and blood stopped. She is back to normal now.<br /><br />All in all we only fed her 5 cans of Pedigree dog food. For those 5 cans to cause this much problems is astounding. I would not recommend Pedigree to anyone after what happened to my dog.",1

"No need to review the product because I'm sure most people in the U.S. who are able to eat peanuts have had these.  These arrived fresh and in good condition.  I can't give even peanut M&Ms more than 4 stars since I think the chocolate used in these products keeps getting worse and worse over time; but they are still a fun, enjoyable snack.<br /><br />I ordered this along with a box of Snickers with Almonds, and Amazon included, as part of my Prime membership, a free ""cold pack"".<br /><br />This consisted of a very thick and sturdy Styrofoam lidded box, in which the candies were packed, along with four large cold-pack freezable units.<br /><br />The item was in shipping transit for approximately 3 days, and delivered to a hot, humid region.<br /><br />Upon opening the container, I found that the candies were still cold and in good condition, although the cold-packs were no longer frozen or really cold.<br /><br />Amazon did a great job on packing this.  Thought I would share that, in case others are concerned about ordering such products from this company.  I'm even keeping the Styrofoam chest and cold-packs for re-use, since they are of pretty nice quality.",4

"I was very disappointed in this product and the people that make it. Why? I recently ordered a substantial order of this ""organic"" tea. When I received it and read the labels, it stated ""natural flavors"" were added to the ""organic"" tea to give it its flavor. We have multiple allergy's in our home and have discovered that many things are hidden in those words, so I contacted the company to inquire about what it was and they never replied to my email. I don't know about you, but when something is hidden, you have the tendency to not respond. If, in deed, the contents were ""organic"" and good, you would have no problem explaining what they are. To everyone looking for good tea...I advise, keep looking.<br />The above statement is only one mans opinion, but I would like to think it is an educated one.",1
"I prefer the ""extra bold"" coffees, so this one really lacking on the flavor.  It's fairly weak, at the smallest cup setting its drinkable, but I won't be buying it again.  I'd recommend the Timothy's World Coffee, Rainforest Decaf Espresso instead.",3
"In the last year or so I've really developed a taste for dark chocolate. I've liked dark chocolate for years but I started eating a bit more recently. I've tried several different brands from the store. All were at least good with some being a little better than others.<br /><br />So. While not scientific my personal taste experience says this dark chocolate bar taste terrible.<br /><br />If you are looking for that silky smooth deep rich dark chocolate flavor that sort of infuses your whole body starting with the tongue and culminating in a very pleasing feeling in your nogging look elsewhere. My God.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you are really into organics and go out of your way to eat all things organic then perhaps this is your chocolate bar. 54% is not a very dark bar and I think it shows in the taste of this bar. The taste could also be due to the organic nature of the bar. That being the case, if you prefer that organic experience, that taste that organics typically have I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />For everyone else, the flavor is off with strange undertones. Not inedible just not very tasty.<br /><br />The bars are fairly small at 2.25 ounces. That isn't really a knock since moderation in all things is a good habit.",2
"I like the flavor of the Peach Mango Kool-Aid.  The flavor is not too artificial and I can definitely tell that the flavors are peach and mango, however mango is much stronger.  I found the drink to be too sweet if mixed per instructions.  I used 4 teaspoons per 24 oz of water (slightly less than 1/2 of the recommended amount) and I thought that it was sweet enough. However, I used cool water.  I am sure that if I used ice-cold water, the drink would taste less sweet.<br /><br />I think the packaging is not well thought through.  I think the opening is too narrow, and not very convenient for reaching in with a spoon.  Also, the outer colorful layer is a shrink wrap.  When the jar is first opened and the lid is removed, the portion of the wrapper that goes around the lid falls off.  That portion contains both the name of the flavor and the instructions in English.

"All of the teas I have had from Hawaiian Islands Tea Company are wonderful. I enjoy the Mango, Pineapple, and Guava flavors - but my favorite is the Coconut Macadamia.",5
I was greatly disappointed in this stuff. They call it cookies but it just dried out chips with little flavor.,1
3 out of my 4 cats will not touch this.  Pretty pricey for alot of gravy & grain & little meat.,1
Not really a toy-more like candy.  Bought this as a gift for a friend's daughter who is really into Japanese things-interesting but much too sweet for me.,3
"In the past year-or-so, I have used three cases of the original product... absolutely wonderful.  On June 2, I received a case of the new reformulated (ie,""watered-down"") version... it is awful! This obvious attempt to cut cost has almost ruined the product.  Please change it back to get a re-order from me.",2
"All my years eating curry, I've never heard about the Blue Mountain brand. I thought BM concentrated only on coffee. I bought this curry for my dad who lives in the US simply because it's the only brand Amazon carries. Next time I'll order the BM Hot Curry which should be much spicier.",3

"The actual product was pretty good, however, I was very disappointed when the package arrived and there were only 2 small bags which I paid over $38 for!  That seems a little high for 2 small bags of boiled peanuts!!",2
"It's evident that this product is boiled down and crystallized before being packaged and sold. There are trace elements that are supposed to make it better than regular sugar.

"Dogs got them as an alternative to beef bones which they are allergic to.  They got right into them, but you must supervise as the knobby ends break off and they are about the size of a large marble so could cause some trouble.  I also noticed they splintered, so they were removed at that point. I like the idea, but the safety issue was a problem.",2

Just mix Bob's buckwheat with a little whole wheat and some brown sugar and regular soy milk and you'll have some mighty good pancakes.  You can check with me at Long Hill Bed & Breakfast at (...) for the recipe.  By using soy milk and leaving out the whole wheat flour you can meet both lactose and gluten intolerant diets.",5
"I have loved these sour balls since childhood but was really disappointed that each can had only 1--I repeat-1 wild cherry sourball. The red included in numbers is something like a raspberry. Really poor form, Charms folks.",4
"The actual product is fine, but all of the cans arrived so crushed that they could not be opened with an electric can opener.  I had to use multiple starts and punches with a manual can opener and finally pry off the lid.",2

"When these got big and hit the shelves, my 2 girls had both grown out of baby food so I didn't notice these.  Not Until my father had handed it to my hungry daughter one day.  It came out of no where so I had no idea why a grown man would have what I thought was baby food in his car.  You see he had got a sample in a food market one day so he had the sample handy in his car one day when his sugar levels dropped.  Being diabetic he needed something fast.  He liked the convenience of these so much he now keeps them handy all the time. My father is a boss to a lot of people and I worry that with the hours he must spend managing so many people, it is a struggle for him to balance ones blood sugar level right once work projects reach their 11th hour.  When he had first figured out he was diabetic, he would occational need to go to the ER because he could get it under control.  Usualy due to working too much combined with not eating enough.  So these things don't just keep the grandkids happy, but help keep him out of the hospital.  For people as busy as my father with diabetes, products as convenet like these are true life savers.",4
"I ordered this collection on 6/9/10 and it arrived on 6/12. Although it was was very well-packaged, this did not prevent the USPS from managing to break one of the tubes. The seller was contacted by email and a replacement requested. As this was a birthday gift and the occasion was only a week away, I offered to pay for expedited shipping. Seller responded immediately stating that a replacement would be shipped ASAP. The replacement tube arrived three days later in good shape. My offer to pay additional shipping charges was declined. In summary, this product is excellent and the customer service absolutely first rate. I highly recommend both the product and the seller.",5
This is a wonderful tea. Great natural flavors and can be enjoyed all year long.<br />Tasty and soothing when served hot and flavorful enough to hold up nicely when iced.<br />It is a favorite at our house.,5
"Hemp seeds have lots of good things going for them including lots of fiber, protein a high content of beneficial fatty acids and phytosterols and loads of other good things. I put a tbsp or so in my salads because of the health benefits, and there is no real flavor impact one way or another. These are pretty small (smaller than barley) and quite happily get lost in the mix of other foods tossed in with them.<br /><br />As a diabetic treating diabetes through diet and lifestyle changes, I no longer eat things like oatmeal, porridge and the like, but if you do, I am sure that adding these to those kinds of meals would be great.<br /><br />They are small but still have a nutty texture, so you can also put them on yogurts for a little texture without any strong flavor.<br /><br />I keep the bag re-sealed in the freezer and refrigerate a small container from which I take what I eat each day. They have kept fine for a long time in the freezer this way, and I have never had any problems with spoilage or rancidity.<br /><br />Rather than dislike them because they are bland in flavor, instead I recommend them highly as an addition to other meals for that very reason!<br /><br />NOTE: These are NOT a powder. They are small hulled seeds - much better than a powder - but if you want or require a powder, these are not a powder...",4
My son loves all of the plum organic baby foods.  He is 8 months old never turns away from their flavors.,5
"I have two Australian Shepherds and they love this product.  I put one in each treat ball and then fill with the small treats.  They get the treats out quickly and then start on the everlasting treat.  If by ""everlasting"" they mean one day, then ok.  They are agressive chewers, but I was hoping that these treats would last at least a week.  They do love the flavors and there is peace a quiet (except for the loud chewing)for one evening, anyway.  We also end up wasting the last bit of the treat as it is under the lip of the ball and they cannot get at it.  All in all, I will continue to buy this product as a special treat for them from Amazon as the cost is less than at PetSmart.",3
"I have to say, I really like this chip.<br /><br />It's a bit thinner than the flaxseed tortilla chips I normally buy at Trader Joe's, and the flavor is nuttier.<br /><br />The small package size is very nice for diet-conscious snackers, although I will say that I wish it were a little bit easier to open. But maybe the thickness of the packaging and the tight seal at the top is to keep in the freshness better.<br /><br />The price point isn't bad, although I can get chips cheaper in larger bags at local grocery stores.<br /><br />Overall, a very good snack product in a very convenient size.<br /><br />Ingredients: Stone ground yellow corn, high oleic sunflower oil, brown rice flower, flax seeds, turbinado can sugar, oat fiber, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, quinoa, soy flour, sea salt.<br /><br />One serving: 1 oz.

organic..tasty and true chocolate taste. I would never go back to buying the store name brand- fake toaster thingies. These are the real deal and taste good too. Great value based on organic ingredients and flavor- as well as how many you get per order. Twelve per shipment.,4
"It only gets one star because there wasn't anything lower! I realise that taste is subjective, but I bought some Truvia from Morrisons yesterday to try it out. It was revolting, tasted 'chemical' and left an awful after taste. Ghastly stuff IMHO. I'm going to take it back and ask for a refund. Yuck! Yuck! Yuck! Be warned.",1
"I ordered three 12-packs so there were three shipping package for my order. The first two 12 packs came ontime as expected. However, one of the bottom have mole growing out of it so it have to be thrown away.<br /><br />The third product made it to my city and then return to the supply. Then it was reship to me next day (free of charge from Amazon). However, I only received 8 packs instead of the 12 packs.<br /><br />The product quality is pretty lousy compared to other coconut juice products I tried. I figure that I give this one a try. It look like somebody went through and open up all the box which made me afraid to drink it sometimes.<br /><br />The taste really do not taste like real coconut. I expect more from 100% coconut. It was pretty cheap to begin with but I think that I would go with other products.",1
"We ordered the Almond Apricot, Almond Coconut, and the Mango Macadamia.<br />We actually liked them in the order listed.<br />I think we will only order Almond Apricot again.<br />They were good!<br /> The Mango's had bit of a after bite. Husband only liked the almond apricot.",3
"While searching for some healthy and tasty food for my son who is in the 10th grade far from home, I came across Eden's selections of legumes and grains.  No longer does my son have to get sick eating cafeteria food laden with sugar, fat, salt, and white flour which makes him ill.  He's feeling great and enjoys the taste of this particular selection: Spanish Rice & Beans.  It is tasty, wholesome, kosher, filling, and shelf stable.  I sooo appreciate AMAZON's subscription arrangement that not only delivers this food when my son needs it, but at such an excellent price! Thank You! G-d Bless you!",5
"I always buy Bigelow's green tea (which aside from the need to use two teabags per cup due to weakness, is satisfactory). Still, I thought I'd give Stash's a go. I immediately knew that I would soon regret doing so when I opened the first tea packet-the smell! Like a stagnant swamp! To make matters worse, it taste like what I would imagine swamp water would taste like. Honey doesn't do much to improve upon the flavor, either. Perhaps this is what people mean when they describe a green tea as ""grassy""? At any rate, I won't be revisiting this one.",1
"This brew seems to light a bit more of a fire under me than previous k-cups I've tried. Perhaps that's why they call it ""Fog Chaser."" Enjoy",4
"It's cereal, right? How bad could it be? Well, in this case, pretty damned bad. I was expecting something like Chex filled with chocolate because that's what they look like, but the whole grain outside tastes terrible. I couldn't finish it. My father liked snacking on them with coffee, so I gave them a two instead of one star.",2
Does taste like a frozen protein shake.  It's just okay with me.  What I didn't figure on was that it's not low in sugar.  A half cup has 9 grams of sugar - too much for a diabetic like me.  I'm disappointed that it's not my HG of desserts.,3
"I'm a fan of most NOW products, but I did not like their Stevia.  I found it had an strange aftertaste, which is more pronounced in coffee than tea.<br /><br />So far, Trader Joe's Stevia is best I've tried.  I'll try Sweet Leaf, which Amazon sells and others have recommended.<br /><br />Unlike Splenda, which causes bloating and intestinal problems in many people, Stevia is relatively safe.  It's actually good for your gums.",3
"I'd like the darkest coffee possible, and this seems about the same as the less expensive dark pods.",3
these are really good exactly what I wanted. threse r not for the faint at heart. very salty and hot yum,5
"This is a condensed soup and comes out of the can as an alarmingly orange gelatinous blob!  Cooked with half and half and a touch of sherry it becomes a tasty pink-colored lobster bisque.  The lobster meat is definitely pureed into the soup (you can taste the occasional fleck of lobster in this).  If you like your bisque chunkier you might want to consider adding some diced lobster meat, crawfish tail meat or chopped shrimp to the soup for a heartier experience.  A dash of brandy would also be a good addition.  I haven't tried the Chincoteague brand bisque.  From the picture on the can it looks like a white, rather than pink, bisque.  From its reviews the Chincoteague sounds like it has more lobster meat in it than this brand does and is more assertively seasoned.  The Chincoteague could be made pink by the addition of a little tomato paste or sweet paprika.  I'll be curious to try it and compare the two brands.",4
"Very Watery - and no latte flavor in sight here.<br /><br />I received one 7oz tin and the instructions said to add 4 teaspoons into a mug with hot water (6-8 oz). Fairly easy, and it dissolved with no problems but very heavy on the peppermint and not much else there. The ingredient list isn't terribly encouraging either with sugar right at the top, followed by the *cream* with a list of things you'd rather not know, with the ""instant coffee"" well towards the bottom of the list. From looking at the Nutrition facts its seems rather high on the carb content.<br /><br />I really didn't find much in this product that I could recommend it at all, and not one I'd try again.",2
HFCS - High Fructose Corn Syrup - is processed differently by your body than sugar and is considerably worse. Do not trust the propaganda of the subsidized Big Ag in America for your truthful info on food.<br /><br />You can get an organic version from Annie's.,1

"I am very fond of Wellness brand itself, but this particular kind just did not get along with my dog's digestive system. I purchased at Petco store. My dog is a Sheltie and she has not had special dietary need that I know of. She was fine with other formulas/treats from Wellness.",1

"In my mind I was thinking the short stacks canisters, you know those short ones about half the size of the regular pringles can.  But I was wrong, this is the snack pack size. These are quite small. I counted about 12 chips per container. I paid $17 for this. I doubt I'd buy it again at that price. The chips were good, but way too few of them. Good for small kids lunchboxes maybe.",3
"One of my wife's favorite mid-day snack is graham crackers and milk.  Personally, I can take it or leave it but, when I saw ""Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Graham"" on the VINE, I thought I'd make it possible for an expert to review the product.  She said that the graham crackers are very tasty and they go well with milk (a requirement for her).  She is conscientious about what she eats and enjoys the fact that Back to Nature IS healthy.  I asked her if she would pay more for ""Back to Nature"" than the regular brand and she said YES!",4
"My son cannot be without these crackers  We have tried the different flavors, and they are good, but he still goes back to this one, the original.  Real cheese is in them so that is a good thing.  They arrived timely and very fresh.  Terrific snack crackers.",5
"Even though I used small puppy kibble, my puppy could not get the kibble out of the bottle. For the treats to come out, the dog needs to pull on the rope and whip the bottle around. Because of the shape of the bottle, the kibble will not spill out on its own while lying on its side. I would think that holding onto the rope and whipping it around would be quite dangerous for the dog as well as anyone standing nearby - the bottle is made from hard plastic and would definitely hurt if it hit you.<br /><br />I decided to remove the rope completely and tried putting in a little ball to slow down the flow of the kibble. That didn't work either - the ball completely blocked the opening (maybe I'll try again with a smaller ball). In the end, I just ended up putting a larger treat (a small milkbone biscuit) in with the kibble and that seemed to work a little better. My puppy is able to get the treats to spill out by tipping the bottle upright. I think I need to experiment more with different sized balls or milkbone biscuits so the kibble spills out easily, but not too easily.<br /><br />On the plus side, the large opening on the bottom of the bottle is great. It makes it very easy to fill the bottle with kibble or treats.<br /><br />I gave this product a 3 because it does what I wanted - it slows down my puppy's eating and keeps him busy for a little while, but for us, it didn't work the way it was intended to work and has the possibility of injuring the dog.",3
"Karl Fazer ""Blue"" is quite simply the world's finest milk chocolate bar. It is rich, creamy (not cocoa-y and artificial tasting like most American-made chocolate bars) and what a chocolate bar should be. Even though it's milk chocolate it complements a nice pinot noir and holds up well. Fabulous.",5
"I love pita chips, and I love Stacy's. Unfortunately, they're way too expensive at my local supermarket for me to get whenever I want, so when I saw the great price on Amazon, I knew I had to buy it!<br /><br />Shipment was super quick--I ordered Sunday, and when I got back from work on Tuesday, they were already waiting for me on my doorstep.<br /><br />But the problem is I ordered pita chips, NOT bagel chips. The bagel chips are pretty delicious too, and I'm actually pretty happy with them, but I don't understand why they mixed up the order. Even the packaging slip on the box clearly says ""Pita chips"" and not bagel chips!",3
"Ok, so I have never had freeze dried pineapple before, so I am not sure if they are ""good"" compared to other freeze dried pineapple. But I found them weird. I mean, they taste like pineapple, but they were not crispy-crunchy like freeze dried strawberries, corn, peaches, and other fruit I have had. The texture of these are not like anything I've had before. As first bite, they crunch a little. Then as your teeth sink in, they are kinda hard-chewy, like those hard caramels. I guess they are just not what I was expecting, based on my other experiences so I was disappointed.<br />I don't think they were damaged in shipment, as it wasn't melted together in one big clump. They were still all individual pineapple chunk pieces.",3
"This coffee is just ok; personally I prefer Barrista Italian - it's just more robust.  Barrista may cost more, but the flavor is far superior to Tully's.",3
These reviews are wrong.It may work but I could not swallow this disgusting swill. I have many Teas. Let me describe this one. Get compost from a gardening store and brew that in a french press. The burnt leaf taste is pungent. Take the pills and buy some earl grey.,1
"My husband and children, for some reason or other, HATE the taste of regular water so I'm always looking for a way to make the water taste different. We were excited to try this as they all love ice tea, but surprisingly it was not the biggest hit in my house. My husband, who loves honey and has been on a honey kick lately, said that it ""tastes like Kool-Aid"". He did drink it but said that he wouldn't be likely to purchase it. My children liked it a bit better than my husband did but they prefer products more like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4FUHG"">MIO Strawberry Watermelon, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>. The bottom line? We likely won't be purchasing this again.",3
"My dog and I both love Zuke's.  The mini naturals are great for training because they are small but super flavorful.  This means that you don't have to cut them up or break them into little pieces (I'm looking at you, Buddy Biscuits), but your dog will still go the distance to earn them.  The small size makes them super convenient.  I have used the peanut butter, chicken, and salmon flavors.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the salmon flavor has an awful stench.  I am used to reeking like dog treats, but the salmon odor is too much.  Upon opening the bag for the first time, I gagged.  Even now, several months after purchasing the 1lb bag, I am still trying to get rid of these treats.  I tried passing them off on my mother, but she wouldn't take them because of the smell.  Yesterday I decided I would just bite the bullet and use them for training for a few days, but after just a couple minutes in the bag I use for treats, I gave up.  I just couldn't take it.  I stuck them back in the bag they came in.  I think I will mix the remaining treats with a giant glob of peanut butter to try to get rid of them in one stinky fell swoop.<br /><br />So Zuke's: we love you.  You have a great mission that both my dog and I both appreciate in our own ways.  The salmon mini naturals, however, definitely miss the mark.  We'll stick to the chicken and peanut butter flavors.",2
"Coffee Bean Direct brand Orange Pekoe Loose Leaf Tea, 2 Pound Bag arrived on time, however, after the first use I am not pleased.  When the bag was opened I noticed the product was speckled with small stems.  In my opinion far too many stems were included with the leaves.  I used approximately 3/4 cup of the tea per gallon of water.  I first steeped the tea in freshly boiled water for about 15 minutes in a quart pan then into the gallon pitcher with cold water.  Very little flavor.  It seemed like the tea was quite old, perhaps not, I am not a tea critic but this tea will more than likely end up being added to the mulch pile in the back yard.  Again, I found the tea to be near flavorless, as in drinking amber colored water.  Perhaps it was a bad batch but I most likely will not gamble with this brand again.",2
The kids love this one! We have tried several organic versions and this is by far the best. A little more difficult to mix and I add more organic milk but it tastes great and they eat it. I have bought this one everytime.,4
I was disappointed to recieve the k-cups in a cardboard box and not in the orginal box.  Coffee does not have its normal fresh taste.,2
"Nice storage bags and the cheapest ones. At first I was concern with quality (didn't want to spend too much and be stuck with junk). So far I had only one bag that leaked out of 30 or so, which is very impressive. Although i don't know if the bag leaks when you thou the milk in the fridge, since ""Lansinoh"" brand had this problem most of the time. Overall very happy with product.",5
"Been looking for a great Ready-To-Drink shake, so I have done a lot of research and testing. This product was ranked low on my list because the tatse was bad and it had nothing really in it except protein. For those looking for a shake with everything and a awesome taste I would recommend Phase III Recovery. That is my opinion but do your research before stocking up.",1

"It would be nice if Amazon would take responsibility for providing complete product information for the items they sell. For example, a buyer might assume that the name Dagoba was significant, perhaps representing the company that manufactures the products. In reality, since 2006, the company that produces ""Dagoba"" chocolate is Hershey's. The cacao products may still be organic and trade certified, but buyers of the products are supporting a huge multi-national corporation, not the small, ethical business that the name Dagoba originally represented.",2
"After finding some user reviews on other sites, I was hopeful that this would be a decent dessert.  Unfortunately the sucralose taste is way too strong for me.  I had the aftertaste in mouth for a full day.  After trying a pack, the rest of the box went in the trash.",1
"We've eaten already-prepared gluten-free bread for years. But with the cut-backs in our budget, I decided to start making my own GF bread. This mix has a very nice texture and good flavor. I did add about 1/4 cup of honey, however, because I like my bread to have a little bit of sweetness to it. I poured the honey into a measuring cup, added the amount of water called for in the recipe and stirred it up good. I then added it to the mix when it called for the water. I also tried the cinnamon bread recipe that they have on the back as a variation and my kids thought it was the best GF bread they had ever had. I used zante currants which are like little tiny raisins. Homemade GF bread is much better than the pre-made stuff. I make about a loaf a week, slice it up, and put it in a ziploc bag in the fridge. We then toast the slices before we use them.",5
"I have a lot of fine, wavy, dark hair, and this product didn't seem to do much for me. I was hoping this product would subtly darken my hair and also nourish it and make it softer. This product did seem to remove some of the red undertones in my hair, but didn't make it thicker or softer. This product is mainly mineral oil with dye and a bit of amla mixed in. For my hair, I prefer natural coconut oil or olive oil, so now if I wish to darken my hair I mix pure amla with either of those oils and get great results.",2
"I bought my first order of this a few days ago and have experimented with putting it in smoothies. I make a banana, frozen strawberry, yogurt, and almond butter smoothie that I really like, for which I have used soy protein in the past. I'm starting to worry about eating too much soy, however, so tried this option. It works just as well but the green powder does make my smoothie turn light ""brown."" The nutty taste blends in well with my drink because it already has the almond butter -- so I don't really notice any flavor change from the soy. I also add a splash of vanilla, which helps. My wife thinks the color is gross, but I don't really care what color I am drinking. So I can definitely recommend this product for smoothies. (As an aside, the same folks make Living Harvest Hempmilk, which is nutty in flavor and also good.)",4
"I just attempted to use this product for baking a couple of days ago and was so very dissappointed.  I have used a few different brands of Date Sugar and have never had a clumping problem.  I believe most of the companies who produce date sugar have to cut some oat flour into it so it doesn't just form one sticky lump.  This is how Bob's Red Mill Date Sugar is...one big 24-oz block of sticky lump.  I had to pound and pound on the mound of date sugar and attempt to whittle away at it with a knife.  I thought I had pulverized it enough to bake with it and boy was I wrong.  When I poured the batter into loaf pans, it had big red clumps of date sugar poking out of the batter.  I picked out what lumps were visible but when I cut into the finished product, it had patches throughout that were sticky and felt like the bread was not done.  I could tell these patches were from the clumps of date sugar.  I was so very sad I bought this product.",1

They specifically work on lung and breathing issues.<br /><br />Can't live without these, I buy them by the case.",5
"I just received 3 Boxes of Kellogs Rasin Bran as a Subscribe and Save purchase.  I like to check the ""Use By Date"" at the stores because it may sit awhile in our pantry before we use it.  I bought Kellogs Rasin Bran at Sam's Club last week, and it has a date for June 2013.  The boxes I just got from Amazon are dated for February 2013, so I will have to use them up first.  It is mid-Sept 2012 now, so there is still time to use the 3 boxes.  But dissapointed that they are closer dated than at the stores here. Also, the Box from Sam's shows Battle Creek, Michigan - and these from Amazon show being from Mexico. Based on this and other reviews here mentioning Kellog's ingredients being altered, I think I will change to another brand and cancel my Subscribe and Save.",2

"We really enjoy the Twinings k-cups.  I'm a casual tea drinker and I think it's a really good cup of tea, and there's no wait for water to boil and for the tea to steep.

So, not quite as good loose tea or bagged tea, but certainly a lot more convenient and a lot quicker.",4

"I Recently bought a 3 pack of this coffee at Bed Bath and Beyond. As its brewing, it smells great (if you like coconut).  The taste isn't bad, but for me, it has that artificial after taste that many flavored coffees have. I gave it 3 stars because it's not terrible. But I wouldn't buy this coffee again. If you're sensitive to after taste, I wouldn't recommend. I'd Grab a dark roast and throw some fresh coconut in there instead if you want a coconut coffee.",3
"This was edible but salty and I thought it was going to be pasta and not rice so I told my son it was going to be basically Mac and Cheese with chicken and brocolli, which he really liked the idea of, but it wasn't then he wouldn't eat it. So, if you expect rice and not pasta, and don't mind the saltiness you to could sort of enjoy it?",3
"Other reviews said the packaging was inadequate, broken or not air tight.  That was not my experience.  Arrived in good condition (I checked every bottle for a proper seal).  The sauce is very good compared to store brands and the price is reasonable considering the quality.",5
"These are great, but I read horror stories about dogs choking or being unable to digest it so I have decided not to give them to my dog anymore. However, there was an article indicating that they changed the ingredients so that there wouldn't be a choking hazard, but I would rather be safe than sorry.",3
"I have been using this Cure as well as some other flavors from High Mountain for 8 years. This is by far the best cure. Sprinkle it on the meat per the directions, rub it in, place in frig for 24 hours. I then put the meat on a Brinkman charcoal smoker. I soak some hickory chips the night before, put 5-8 Kingsford charcoal briquets in the bottom of the smoker, add some hickory chips for the first hour and smoke the meat for about 6-7 hours total at 125-150 degrees. I add charcoal every 1/2 hour or so as needed to keep the tempature right. The meat comes out nicely dried with a hint of hickory flavoring. The pepper mix complement each other perfectly. I used to smoke alot of Flank Steak, but that got too expensive so I use a rump roast sliced to 1/4"" or so. I have since been using up alot of Venison roasts and this works great although I have to cut down on the cooking time somewhat 4-5 hours beacuse the venison will get too dry since it is so lean.",5
"This coffee smelled great, but the taste was less impressive.  It wasn't that the coffee was too bitter or strong, it was that the taste was sort of blah.  There was nothing remarkable about the flavor, it really was quite boring, if one can call a coffee boring.  This coffee would do the job in the morning if I didn't have any better stuff to drink, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it.  It's just not very flavorful.  If it tasted like it smelled it would have been so much better.",3
"I'm a FOOL! I got sidetracked by the words ""Moroccan Mint,"" and forgot the green tea aspect. For me, this tea, although decent, has a green tea after taste. Well, duh, it has green tea in it! I was thinking it would be like Stash's Morcorran Mint, and that tea I LOVE.",3

They are just as heathly as the Straws(actually much MORE Heathly + Way Less Fat) but these are 1000% yummier!! If you could combine the heathliness of Veggie Straws with the delightful evil of Cheetos Puffs- you would get these!! If you like Cheetos Puffs texture- your gonna LOVE these- They have the same texture and salty cheesy flavor- But are totally heathly!! I am so Hooked on these Veggie Krinkle Sticks. I Cant get enough! My kids ages 11, 8 and 5 also LOVE em and beg me to put them in their lunches! A Must Buy Snack!",5

"Come on, this is 2005. Twinkies aren't ""food"" anymore than Cheez Whiz is. Twinkies were invented back in the 30s before science understood the impact of the product on our bodies. Consider that in those days doctors were used to advertise cigarettes in magazines. Everyone needs a sugar fix every once in a while - I'm just as guilty of that - but eating Twinkies is practically self-mutilation. Look at the ingredients list and do some reading. Yikes! Everyone's family deserves tasty snacks that happen to be healthy too. Sorry Hostess, that definitely does not include Twinkies.",1
"This box mix is better than home made.  It has a rich deep chocolate chip and chewy cookie.  I just press the batter into a square pan, bake it, then cut into bar sized cookies.  Delicious and never get tired of them..I buy them by the case now as I can't find them in a store anymore,",5
"Low quality and low flavor hot sauce....not all that hot either.<br /><br />If you need some hot sauce and have nothing else around, then this will do, but that there are so many other choices, this is the worst choice to make. Even regular tobasco sauce is much much better.<br /><br />I can only describe it as being similar to watery taco bell sauce.<br /><br />I would recommend Frontera Hot Sauce, Tobasco, or Cholula Hot sauce over this.",2
"I agree with one reviewer that I'd like a little more salt. Mine arrived very melted, in one giant clump. They are very sticky so it was quite messy to eat them. I do live in a warm climate so I kind of expected to have that issue. They taste pretty good but if you are looking for a gourmet sea salt and caramel candy, you won't be thrilled with these. I tried a sea salt caramel in a wine store and was amazed, it was delicious but a package of only 5 candies was very pricey so I ordered these. Next time I think I'll just spend the money for a smaller amount of really good quality caramels. These are much better than the caramels you can buy in a grocery store, just not quite salty enough for me.",3
"This is the best jerky I've ever had, and I'm so sad my grocery store doesn't carry it anymore. I have to buy it online now.

The only downside is I can't stop eating it!",5
"It is hard to review products like these because results are very dependant on each person's physiology and are also subjective.  I don't think anyone who has said they've had great success with this product is lying, nor do I think those that have said they've had little success are lying.  As such this is a product you have to try to see what happens for you.<br /><br />I am not a huge consumer of energy products, but I do like to them from time to time.  My standard has been Rockstar Zero Carb (i.e. no sugar) which is a full size energy drink.  I have found that it works well and usually I don't need to drink the entire can.  The appeal of 5-hour Energy is its small size and easy storage.  I don't drink Rockstar for it's outstanding taste, so if I can get the energy in something smaller and easier to consume, why not try?<br /><br />I first tried 1/2 a bottle of 5-hour Energy as some of the reviews made me a bit wary of how I might react.  I found that 1/2 bottle had almost no effect.  On a different day I tried the entire bottle and again I saw almost no effect.  It is possible that there was a slight pickup, but nothing that would make this product worth buying.  I find this a bit strange because the ingredients and amounts appear to be more than what is found in the Rockstar Zero Carb mentioned above.  As such I would expect at least the same level of energy pickup, but again that wasn't close to being the case.<br /><br />I am not going to throw in the towel just yet, however.  I plan to try the ""extra strength"" version of this product to see if that yields a better result.  For now though, while I cannot personally recommend this product based on my own results, I think each person will have to try and see for themselves.<br /><br />Update: I tried the ""extra strength"" version of this product.  I took the entire bottle and found little to no difference between this and the ""regular"" version.  Since the regular version, as mentioned above, had pretty much no effect on me, I don't plan to buy anymore of this product.",2
"I bought this product because a review I read said it dissolved easily.  It doesn't dissolve in cold broth, it just clumps up, and heating the mess cooked the egg powder into hard lumps.

"Ok, yes, this particular whey protein doesn't contain artificial sweeteners or other stuff you don't want in your diet but it really tastes awful and I haven't found a satisfactory way to dress it up.  I tried putting it in my coffee...it just ruined my normally delicious cup of coffee.  I tried putting it in juice but I had to make the juice (from frozen) really concentrated to make it taste ok..and then it still smells awful.  Jarrows whey may be better than 30 others out there but it's still not good enough to make me happy to take it.  I always like it when other reviewers tell me what's a better option so here's my advice.  Buy a jug of Optimum Nutrition Solid Gold.  It has fake sweeteners which I don't like but it tastes really good in a glass of skim milk! I'll probably throw the rest of this Jarrows whey in the garbage (unless I figure out how to cook with it or something).",2
"I love buffalo jerky but don't eat it too often because of the cost.  One company in Jacksonhole, WY charges nearly half the cost of the product for shipping and handling.  And at $45 a pound plus $21 for shipping, it's just way too pricy no matter the taste. Another company out of Texas has jerky that is so hard that you need to soak it in water to soften it up for eating - yuck!  So when I decided to try Golden Valley, I did so without much anticipation that it would be pliable to eat due to the cost.  Instead I love it!  The jerky is delicious with the perfect amount of pepper and just enough sweetness to give it a pleasant under taste.  I don't have to tussle with the jerky trying to eat it as it is pliable yet gives that chewy pleasure that good jerky properly prepared has.  I will be ordering over and over again now that I've found a brand that is good value and delicious!  Thank you Golden Valley!",5
"Like the SWITCH beverage I previously reviewed, this is a moderately tasty drink.  The balance of the carbonation and the fruit juice is decent enough, giving more of a tickle to the tongue than the rush of bubbles that soda usually gives.  It's definitely a lot more like juice than soda, which goes against its purpose of being a replacement for soda.  Overall, it's pretty drinkable, but I would never seek this beverage out.  There are better juices, and there are better sodas.<br /><br />One major plus, though, was that it wasn't as thick and syrupy as the Watermelon/Strawberry SWITCH.<br /><br />6/10",3

"My daughter is Chinese, and each year we send hong bao (red envelopes) to school for her to pass out to her classmates.  In China, children receive hong bao on New Year (CNY) from their families, with money inside.  For several years we purchased chocolate coins, but due to a child in her class having a severe peanut allergy, we didn't want to use chocolate coins because we could not be sure they were produced in a peanut-free factory.  So we ordered four packages of these bubble gum coins.  The coins are wrapped in bright foil.  It is a bit hilarious that we were using coins stamped with Mexican words and symbols for CNY, but the kids didn't seem to notice or care.  The gum is predictably a bit hard.  All things considered, a fun item.",4
"If you need more fiber in your diet I recommend these. They are NOT good by themselves and are quite dry. With that being said I follow a fairly strict (no fun/boring) diet and find these help me with fiber and to satisfy my need for crunch. This will likely sound gross to many but my favorite way to eat them is drizzled with sugar free pancake syrup, a little cinnamon and topped with a big pile of cottage cheese - LOVE this! I also spread peanut butter on top or  a laughing cow blue cheese triangle. For 12 calories and 2 net carbs these are a great base for a low cal snack.",4

"I got into drinking mint infusions each morning as a substitute for coffee.  It seemed a good idea to get it in bulk, since I was paying about $3/box for 24 herbal tea bags.  (Don't re-use herbal tea bags.  Wastes water and electricity.)<br /><br />Somehow I missed that this was a 'pack of 2'.  Two 16 oz. bags of mint leaf amount to the stuffings of a sofa cushion.  Or a bed pillow, assuming you could sleep through the crackling.  To appreciate this product you should be fairly adept with a tea ball (schlepping a generous teaspoon of the mint leaves into a metal container with holes in it and dunking it all in a very hot cup of water), You also need a bit of patience (to allow it to steep 5 minutes) and a fair amount of imagination.  Then you may learn to like this infusion, and if you're really imaginative, you can even pretend it's a great wake up brew in the mornings.  Frankly, that's a stretch.<br /><br />I would not buy this product, unless you intend to make 'iced' mint herbal tea, hot herbal mint tea, mint ice cubes, and some kind of mint salve.  Otherwise I expect it will go flat or rancid, depending on just how much peppermint oil is included in that mint leaf.  Or, you could invest in a tea bag machine and make your own tea bags to sell on-line.I happen to have discovered an Amish cheese shop which markets mint tea bags by the quarter pound.  Those $3 grocery store  24 count herbal teas?  This place sells 24 bags for a buck.  Of course I did not discover that bargain until after I'd order the sofa cushion full of mint leaves. I'm thinking of making soap, candles, and sachets for Christmas gifts.",3

"I have always like Alba brand products from the standpoint that they use plant-based ingredients which are far better for the skin than the other more expensive brands found at Macy's and the like. One only needs to use about a peas-size for the face as it can be a bit oily. Overall, it's a good product that I can use right before applying my make-up and use again after washing my face. This jar will last me quite awhile, so I can appreciate that. Pleasant smell too, not overwhelming with fragrance like most facial creams.",3
"I ordered FunBites MiniCongo Digestive Support, 7-Count (Pack of 4) for my dog not realizing that they would be too big for my Shih Tzu's mouth.  Since they are called ""minicomgo"" I got the wrong impression upon the size.  My dog will lick the hard bone material so I know she liked the smell and taste, but laboring over the thickness is too much for her.<br /><br />However, FunBites MiniCongo Digestive Support, 7-Count (Pack of 4) would most likely be lovely for a larger pet.

"The Bag I received had a rancid ingredient in it. The Exp. date was 8/29/2012. Something made it through quality control. It is a product I would try again, though. There is a good ratio of protein to sugars. The bite I did have was mildly sweet, which I prefer.<br /><br />Update: I contacted the company about the product and provided the exp. date and batch information. They believe it could be due to storage and handling of the product. From the way I received the product I could see that as a possibility. When I get more information I will add that to my review.<br /><br />Update 11/28/11: Looks like customer service is either overworked or inept. I am guessing the later. As mentioned above, I sent a short email with the date and batch number. The response I received back asked for that information. I gave my address and after confirming a post-paid envelope was coming, I responded three weeks later saying I never received it. I received a response back saying he mailed it on 11/4. I emailed him my address on 11/7. I have no way to contact the CEO, so maybe the company is inept as well.<br /><br />Update 12/8/11: The customer service rep sent me another bag to try. Mind you, he is fully aware I am reviewing this product on amazon. The second product was slightly stale tasting. The clusters ranged from granola type flakes all the way to a 2x3 inch chunk. The taste varied by cluster the first one I had was bland, the second sweet and excessive with the cinnamon. Basically, this product should have never passed quality control. The only positive I can say is they communicated.<br /><br />I must recommend avoiding KIND snacks. A companies product is only as good as its organization in my opinion.",1
"Let me start by saying my 7 month old son, who is used to my home prepared baby foods LOVES this, as a once in a blue moon convenience meal! I've tried it and it tastes pretty good to me too. Rare in the baby food industry.<br /><br />I am following a weaning guide that I used for my daughter, and it makes you pretty wary of commercial baby foods as babies easily get used to the bland, watery taste and sometimes take a lot of coaxing to go back to home made, healthy meals, resulting in picky toddlers and children. My daughter is now 3 and has never refused a home cooked meal yet, and I attribute that to the hard work I put in in the first year. Another problem with commercial baby foods is that they are usually so padded out with water that nutritional needs aren't fully met during the day and babies can start waking in the night due to genuine hunger.<br /><br />I'd love to ask, who came up with the magical 4oz measurement for all stage 2 baby food jars and packets, though? My son takes more like 6oz of my home prepared meals which are much ""fuller"", so I've had to add a little sweet potato to this to increase the volume. And it does seem really quite runny and padded out with water, so I add a teaspoon or 2 of rice cereal to thicken it up a little. Before long, I'm sure he'll just be on 2 full 4oz jars when I give him this.<br /><br />All that said, I'll reiterate, it is really quite tasty for a commercial baby food, and I have no problem giving it to my son once in a while. I do recommend!",4

"Since Neuro Bliss screwed up their formula, I tried this out as a replacement.  One man's meat is another man's poison, so I suppose you can never tell if something like this will work for you unless you try it.  In my case, though, I've been getting different results.  The first 3 or 4 times I tried it, I almost fell asleep (so, as it says on the can, don't drink before driving).  Other times, it would just relax me.  Once or twice, it even made me agitated, and a few times it barely seemed to have any effect at all.  All these attempts were usually a couple of days and sometimes a couple of weeks apart, so I don't think I'm building up a tolerance to it.  A 12 ounce can contains 43.5 grams of pure cane sugar, so you probably don't want to drink it before you go to bed.",3

"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",1
Dog loves them and they give her a minty pleasing breath for a short period of time.,4
"okay, it's true our dog was used to the few stale varieties of dog food available in our remote location, but I still think it's the quality of this dog food she likes.  At any rate, she eats it all immediately.  She looks better, her hair is shinier, and she seems to feel better.  So if she were voting I think she'd give it a paws-up.",4
"Okay, these are pretty darn tasty.  I have tried several different brands of veggie jerky, and so far, these are my faves.  I've tried several different flavors (Texas Barbecue ranks at the top of my list), and they're all pretty good.<br /><br />They are pretty moist, almost to the point of being a little saucy.  They can be just a bit messy to eat, but the benefit is that they are GREAT to eat on a sandwich!  Terrific by themselves and amazing on bread... makes me smile.<br /><br />The packaging can get a little frustrating.  They are serrated at the top, so in theory, you should be able to tear the edge and open the entire package along the side of the strip.  Unfortunately, it doesn't exactly work that well.  A lot of times it will rip off and make it difficult to get the strip out of the package.  I just use scissors now.  Just a minor complaint.<br /><br />But seriously, these things are delicious.  Even my carnivorous friends like them (and it's usually impossible to get them to touch a substitute).  Definitely recommend!",4
"This cat food literally has the consistency of chicken noodle soup.  It is at least 70% water.  And I mean straight up WATER.. not moisture.  You shake the can and it sounds like it's full of liquid, and it is.<br /><br />My cats didn't even bother to smell it, much less taste it, and they will eat darn near anything.<br /><br />The first time, I dumped it in a bowl and it looked like some kind of soup with a few fragments of ground meat.<br /><br />The second time, I tried squeezing out the can with the lid, like how you would squeeze out the water in a can of tuna.  This yielded maybe 2 ounces of food in the 6 ounce can.  The cats wouldn't eat that either.<br /><br />In summary, this is the most pathetic excuse for cat food I have EVER seen  and I have lived with cats for all of my 29 years.",1
"I see that some reviewers also noted very weak coffee with these, yet some rave about it. I've only tried one box of the GJ's Hazelnut (won't be ordering more). We've bought other Gloria Jean's which are good, such as the Butter Toffee. So, it may be a quality control issue and you may or may not have good luck w/ Hazelnut. I cannot even detect Hazelnut flavor by taste nor a good hazelnut fragrance as this brews (unusual with flavored coffee k-cups). I've tried various sizes - even the small cup setting doesn't produce a flavorful coffee.",2
"From everything I've read, you need to get the right size or your dog can pop out the treat.  We have a 16 lb pom/boston mix, she can't get the treat out of the medium.  I can see all the teeth marks in the everlasting treat, she is really working it.  I fill the other side with some of her daily kibble and she'll roll it around and get her kibble out.  I've put in other treats and she'll go after them too.  The flaps are rather thick, which makes it hard for the treats to come out.  Good for keeping the interest, but not so good for younger dogs that lose interest quickly.  She would have ignored this a month or two ago, at 8 months she can play with it longer.  I put in easy things to get out now, I'll make it harder in a week or two.  This treat, and the inserts, are on the expensive side, but it seems durable enough and she likes it.",4
"These squares aren't very big -- about 2 and a half inches wide -- but they're very dense. The 12-count box is heavy! And they pack a lot of flavor into a small space. When you unwrap one of these, you're hit by a rich orange aroma. The texture is chewy. These squares are meant to be savored, not wolfed down. I like that this company's products are vegan and they're made from a short list of simple, natural ingredients. But if you don't like sesame, you will not like these squares. If you're like me and enjoy sesame, I suggest also trying Frankly Natural's tahini cookies.",4
"I didn't actually order this but was sent it by mistake. In searching to see what might have happened, I found it and noticed that the picture doesn't match the description--and I can tell you from what I was sent, it is the description that is correct, not the picture.  That is to say, this includes Breakfast Blend and not Columbian Fair Trade. If when you read this review you see that the picture shows Breakfast Blend and not Columbian Fair Trade, you can ignore this review--I'm just putting it here to warn people not to be deceived by the picture (I plan to take this review down if the picture is changed to properly reflect what's in the box but there will inevitably be at least a delay in me doing that and perhaps I'll even just forget to do it entirely).",1
I've been looking for this type of seasoning for quite a while and finally found it with this product.  It is a salt product with flavoring added unlike so many other products that simply add flavor but not salt.,5
"My dogs really love this product. I was purchasing it from a warehouse but they stopped carrying them for a while, so I was thrilled to find them here but the price is much more. The item is still a great product and they arrived very quickly.",2
"Now, we have a lot of Crystal Light in the pantry (Raspberry Lemonade is a favorite). I don't mean to sound like a broken record about my recent Crystal Light Moctail reviews, but...<br />This Appletini just *isn't*. Once you get it in your mind that hey, it reminds you of Jolly Ranchers, then that is all you'll think about as you sip it. Which makes it taste gross, the thought of liquid Jolly Ranchers in your glass. (Yes it also has the aspartame aftertaste...) Like the Margarita, it seemed to be quickly overwhelmed with the ice and would probably have held up better if using two pouches for the 2 quarts instead of one.<br /><br />None of us liked this, not even a little bit. The smell was a little gagful. It's not a flavor that I could consider mixing with something else to make it taste good. (That's pretty bad!) One plus, it's so green that you could probably foist it off on Trick-Or-Treaters in October, as ""Witch Brew""!",2
This is a great product that tastes great and the uses are endless! I have purchased sugarless and with sugar and both are great!,5
"I've been feeding this to my dog for months and I have just realized his stool has been pretty runny the whole time, today he had diarrhea again, probably the second or third time during that period.  I came online to see if others have been having the same problem as me, and sure enough the answer is yes.  I'm done with this dog food, I'd suggest you do the same, it's just not right.",1
"This is one of those classic fun-filled movies.  It ""aged"" well and kept a room full of 10 and 11 year olds happy.",5
"Costco has a similar item, except it has 80 K cups and costs $34.99, which is $.44 a cup. Not a bad deal!",1
"*Warning* These chips are like eating a raw habanero pepper.<br /><br />This is literally the hottest processed food product I've ever eaten. I use to think what I normally ate was pretty hot, until I tried these. They taste pretty good, but good luck trying to eat a whole bag in one sitting. I can barely get down 10 chips before my nose and eyes are watering and my mouth is on fire. I'd compare their taste, texture, and crunchiness to Tim's Cascade Jalapeno (which I love,) but they're probably around 5 times as hot as those chips. Don't get me wrong, these things are pretty tasty, but I'm still working on polishing off my first bag that I received 3 days ago.<br /><br />I'm probably going to keep some for myself to eat, since they don't go bad for a year from now, but the others I'm probably going to use for pranks on my family and friends. Only takes one chip to set your mouth on fire. =D",4
"Agreed with previous reviewer, these brownies are more like cookies and they are sweet but I found them to be a satisfactory after dinner treat. I prefer them crumbled over Ben and Jerry vanilla ice cream.:-) If you are expecting a chewy rich chocolate taste and feel do not buy them, make your own brownies from the box (Betty Crocker) since I found them to be more of what I am used to as a brownie. By the way the price here is outrageous, they are way cheaper at Marshals and TJ MAX.",4
"I was not impressed about this product (Made in China). Cheaply made and not very good quality. Outside was coated with redish brown sweet something which stained the carpet.  My dog first tried to lick the coating and then bit the ""bone"".  It was like hard leather, more than bone, and left a mess of shreds about as well.",2
"This seems like a cross between a regular soda and an energy drink.  Some of energy drinks do taste awful.  The ""No Fear"" drink taste a lot better but still have the taste of the Taurine type of drinks.  You cannot really compare this with Red Bull or 5-Hour as it is more like in the same league as ""Monster"".<br /><br />I don't find a lot of difference with other products.  Because of the volume, this caters to those who want to also quench their thirst and not only for the energy boost.  In terms of energy boost, I find a bottle of Gatorade just as good.",3
"I ordered two cases for my Mom who loved (past tense) this tea.  They really did not improve this product like they claim.  They took out the Hibiscus and added white tea ""for a smoother taste"".  It does not have the fantastic raspberry taste it used to have at all.  Now we have two cases that nobody wants to drink.  I did manage to scour my local grocery stores (7-8 of them) and find the last 5 boxes in my area.  All I can say is that I/we hope that Celestial Seasonings comes to their senses and goes back to the original formula.  And yes we did contact Celestial Seasonings and make complaints with them.  Why do companies have to go and mess up a good thing?",1
"I like the orange, but make sure you dilute this more than you would the others as the flavor is very, very sweet.  I'm not going to buy it again, but I will finish the box.",3
Not the best gummy rings out there. They are very good though. If you are a hater of sweet don't get them ;). I myself have little to complain about. Huge gummy ring fan. Buy them and enjoy!,4
"a good, healthy product but I was sorely disappointed in the condition of the cans upon opening the package:  The 12 cans were packed in neat rows in a shallow cardboard box, and wrapped in plastic, but each and every can was dented, some quite badly.  Guess I could have returned them, but instead checked for air leaks by immersing in a tub of water and found none.  wouldn't order again.  should have been tightly packed in a smaller box to avoid shifting, I guess.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BMDF1M"">Health Valley Organic Soup, Vegetable with Salt, 15 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>",3

"Keurig is amazing and Green Mountain coffee is just as amazing.<br />This is coffee that will open your eyes in the morning, as well<br />as provide a welcome break during the day.<br />Its not bitter, its smoooooooooooth and mellow.<br />No aftertaste.  Love it!!!!!!!!!!",4
"I snack on kind Bars and love most of them; they are filling, healthy, and generally tasty!",5
"I can't rate the canned pineapple because I was sent canned tropical fruit.  My family doesn't like tropical fruit, so I don't know what I am going to do with a case of it.  I also don't see a simple way to contact Amazon about this mixup because this product cannot be returned.  I am generally pleased with Amazon, but this mistake was a pretty big one for my family.",1
"I love getting my coffee from Amazon because they have many gourmet varieties that are fair traded.  This coffee is no exception.  It has that ""Fresh coffee bean"" smell upon opening the bag.  Nice flavor once ground and brewed.  Highly recommended.",5
"I'm not sure this helps the tarter since my dogs need their teeth cleaned every other year but I can tell you they really love this stuff.  It does seem to help their breath, probably by settling their stomachs, and they never had a bad reaction to this treat.",5
"My daughter was put on the orange goodstart at birth.  But after going through several long nights, and her screaming bloody murder before she'd potty (she went two days without going potty), her doctor switched over to this formula.  She never spit up and she burped much easier on this. She started pooping 2-3 times a day. Although it was still hard balls, she didn't scream and it didn't smell as bad. Her dr. said she's still constipated and that is why her poop is so hard. So they have switched her yet again to the natural cultures in the green can. She's only been on it for 24 hours and has already started showing gas signs and has been spitting up all evening. Not sure if she just needs time to adjust or what. I know with the blue soy she seemed to have been doing much much better.<br />Only thing I dont like about the soy formula is the greasy residue it leaves in the bottles. You have to let them soak in hot water in order to clean them properly.",3
"I am a fan of these cookies and order frequently.  This was the first time that I had broken cookies,  They were still delicious but several were all crumbs. I compained in packaging feedback as well but it was the inside box that smashed the cookies. Only gave three stars due to breakage.  These are five star cookies!",3
"Popchips are ok.  However, these snacks are made from potato flakes, similar to ""Pringles"".  If you have ever eaten ""Funyuns"" the onion flavored rings made by Frito Lay you have already tasted pretty much what Popchips taste like, just without the onion flavoring.  If your not concerned with calories, but simply want the best potato chip you can buy, try ""Grandma Utz"" potato chips, a true potato chip.",2
"The best hazelnut coffee you can buy for a Keurig, but Amazon is charging (currently) almost $40 for 2 23-pod boxes; the price should by at least $15 below that. If you see this coffee here for $25 or less for a 48-count shipment, get it!",4
This is very powdery milk.  When I pour it out of the bag it flies everywhere.  This makes it messy to use.,4
"My kids and I have tried several brands of whole wheat macaroni and cheese, and this is definitely our favorite.  You certainly can taste that it's whole grain, but we've gotten used to it and think it's quite tasty.  As a mom, I like that the cheese isn't florescent orange and is quite easy to clean up as a result.  A yummy, ""healthy"" mac 'n cheese delivered by your UPS guy at a great Amazon subscribe & save price...what more can you ask for?!",5
Good size for a 60-80 pound dog. Might be a little small for any breed over that. Made in the USA and our dogs love them so they passed the test.,5
"Great product, but you should refrigerate them.  First batch I bought spoiled.  Talked to company and they said they were trying to solve it.",3
"I love to use this syrup in my coffee (and other flavors to make slushies for my kids).  The pricing is great with subscribe and save (and even better when they offer the additional 10% off).  The problem is Amazon shipping is horrible.  I had to have my last shipment replaced 3 times since the bottles kept arriving damaged during shipment.  The warehouse does put any protective packaging in the box or using a box way too big.  Then the bottles move around too much during shipment and leak all over.  Amazon is great about replacing the items but my last order was replaced multiple times because each time the bottles arrived broken open and leaking all over.  Great price, but really not worth the hassle.",2
"I love bold strong flavors and this is not quite there.  The raspberry fragrance is fantastic!  The chocolate is not present in the taste or the fragrance.  If smell alone will suffice or you like mild coffee, this one is for you.",3
"Love my K-Cups.  Thought this deal was too good to be true, so I snagged it.<br />I guess the only drawback was that the product had outlived it's shelf date.  I wouldn't mind it as much if I were totally aware of it when purchasing.  I still would have bought it, but I felt a little cheated when it arrived.  So far the product tastes the same, I am just glad I bought it for me personally instead of for work or friends.",3
"OH YES, this is puffed rice all right. BUT ITS BROWN RICE, not WHITE RICE PUFFED.<br /><br />and they don't tell you that up front.<br /><br />sorry, brown rice puffed, doesn't cut it for taste.<br /><br />there is nothing like white rice puffed rice for taste..<br /><br />now if they would make a frosted white puffed rice, it would sell.",2
I really like medium strength coffee but this is a little too bold to be considered medium. It is almost bitter when compared to other medium coffees.,3
"The bar is very tasty and has the protein I was looking for. A great product. I canceled just this month because the price went up by nearly $2. With shipping, a box now costs $14, which is still not bad compared to many other protein/nut bars on the market. Just a little too expensive for me.",4
"If you order a pound of Tootsie Rolls you're in for a treat.  Last Halloween I ordered 12 for the different Trick or Treaters in my neighborhood and filled a large pumpkin with the bitesize treats.  Would you believe it, the kids ran me out of 12 full pounds!  I suspect that some of them doubled back to my doorbell once they saw the quality of goodies I was handing out.  Don't worry, I kept a few for myself too.  Because as long as you're a kid at heart, you'll keep your yen for America's original candy, Tootsie Rolls, the treat so tasty they named a movie after it.<br /><br />You don't need to give them any special treatment.  They will keep in a candy dish in your apartment or home, or they can be safely and easily stored in cupboard or freezer.  Warning, don't try to give them to your cat, I have heard that they are not too good for our feline friends.",5
"This new feature of popping corn in a container that can be turned into bowel should appeal to most everyone, but in this case they should have spent more time trying to improve the taste of the popcorn. It's dry and tasteless. You could be eating sawdust and not know the difference. Their powdered butter flavor is worthless. Wonder why companies don't spend more time trying to improve the flavor of their food rather that how much and how fast they can get it to market?",3
"My local whole foods store has moved so I was on the lookout for some plain rice crackers. At least one of these  in the mix has an odd flavor, but the biggest disappointment is that they have MSG! What ""good sense"" is that?! Unfortunately, a list of the ingredients cannot be accessed on the website, only the nutritional information. Don't waste your money, drive to your local whole foods store. If you don't want to do that, come on over, I have plenty of these!",2
"We decided to buy this from Petco through Amazon instead of going to their store to get it. It was a little cheaper and it saved us a trip. To our surprise, the product isn't the same color or consistency as what we have purchased from their stores for the last few years. To make matters worse, one of our cats has suddenly developed a swollen lower lip. This can be due to an allergic reaction, and it makes us wonder if it's a response to the obviously different product we received and fed to them.<br /><br />Update 5-27-10:  As noted above, the first two cases were different than what's in the stores. Our next order was normal color and consistency. Looks like a Quality Control issue. I'll update further about our experience.",3
"I bought these because I ran out of the fragrant, fruity green peppercorns that I bought a couple of years back at Zabar's in NYC, and because at least one of the reviews made them sound similar.  The batch I got, however, are hot like a capsicum pepper (hot red pepper.)<br /><br />I wrote a note to JR customer service, and they sent me some pink peppercorns at no charge.",4
"I really liked how my hair looked at first when I tried this shampoo but by day 3 and 4 I started developing itchy bumps on my scalp. I also realized that this product was leaving a film on my hair. I had been using sulfate free shampoos for the last few years but I broke down and bought this because of all the great reviews. This shampoo is not for everyone. If you're at all sensitive to chemicals, stay away. I went back to an awesome shampoo that I stick with. Every time I try something new, nothing treats my hair and scalp the way Henna Hut shampoos do. I've tried them all and I like their Neem shampoo the best. I don't work for them. I'm just a customer who appreciates them more and more every time I try other products.",1
"First of all, I am NOT a picky eater, especially when I am cooking for myself. I regularly eat low-carb, understand low-carb junk food will never taste like the real thing, and I enjoy it regardless. This is the first low-carb snack I've ever made that I could not finish (and believe me I tried).<br /><br />I love the idea of an easily prepared mac & cheese cup, and anything low-carb with a shelf life. But I'm just not sure this works.<br /><br />The noodles are not macaroni, they are thin like crushed up angel hair. But they do not taste like angel hair pasta, they're sour (maybe the recommended time left them undercooked?). If you're looking for pasta at home, and can eat wheat gluten, definitely buy Dreamfield's low carb pasta instead. But if you are avoiding wheat gluten, maybe this is an option for you.<br /><br />I bought a few of these so I'm not sure what to do with the rest, I'm thinking I will get creative with the recipe and if I come up with anything good I will definitely post my ideas here! I haven't quite given up yet.<br /><br />Other than that, I was really disappointed the noodles were not macaroni and wished someone would have written about it in a review, so that's what I'm doing. :)",3

"Terra Blue potato chips are everything they say they are: delicious and so good that they're practically addictive, lower in fat than most other types of potato chips with zero tans fats, and they have a neat bluish color with just a touch of black here and there that gives them an aesthetic appeal. As another reviewer notes, it's very, VERY easy to eat a whole bag of these at once--they're only one ounce bags and even if the bags were larger these chips are as good as can be!<br /><br />They do contain salt and some carbs, so check the nutrition label if these are concerns for you. They are also kosher if that matters to you.<br /><br />Overall, these chips are the best! I highly recommend them.",5
"These are a hard candy--hard like a Lifesaver, not like a hard toffee such as the Rio coffee candy, which will soften somewhat in your mouth. The flavor is about as about as strong as the Rio and tastes very similar to the Rio when you have a good batch of Rio. It is noticeably less piquant and not as strong as the Bali coffee candy. The pieces about the same size as the Bali and they are not nearly as large as the Coffee Nips brand, which are annoyingly big on size and disappointingly small on flavor.<br /><br />They are not difficult to unwrap, being packaged in the same kind of individual pouches as the Bali.<br /><br />If you like the United, I think you will probably appreciate the Bali more. IF you like the United but prefer a toffee, you might like the Rio better, provided it's a good batch.<br /><br />_______________Coffee Flavor_____________Texture<br />Bali...........piquant/rich/strong.............hard sugar<br />Rio............moderate-varies by batch......hard toffee<br />United.........moderate.......................hard sugar<br />Kopiko.........piquant/rich strong............hard sugar<br />Coffee Nips....weak/bland.....................hard toffee",4
"So it has sucrolose in it. So what? It tastes great and is a lot better for you then sugar. It fights tooth decay as opposed to sugar which causes it. Ideal has no vile after taste. Closest taste to sugar, and will make a diet easier to follow. If i used splenda i would go back to sugar, if i used stevia i would be broke, if i used sweet n low or equal i would vomit. Ideal is not better then sugar but it is a great substitute and will keep those insane amounts of sugar out of your diet if you drink your coffee like i do. I bought a bag today and i'm gonna clean out my sugar shaker and fill it with ideal.",5

"I cringed a little after reading the ingredient list. Way too much grains and not enough quality protein for our dogs. Notice all of them are at the beginning, which means they make up quite a bit of the diet. Soy protein is included but some dogs don't do well with soy (mine) and meat should be the protein source in dog food, not grains.<br />Not recommended for your furry ones.",2
"I was pleasantly surprised by the stronger than I expected ginger flavor in this product.  It is excellent, if you like ginger, try this.  Best on hot biscuits!  Update.  I've just reordered, wish they sold it by the gallon, its different, something you can't find locally and excellent.",5
"This tea was a disappointment. Way too acidic for my taste.  I do not add sugar to my teas so maybe if you do, it might be acceptable.",1
"I wish I had read the reviews before I wasted my money buying this product.  I agree with other reviewers that this has a VERY artificial sweetner taste to it. I love chai lattes from coffee places and was hoping that this could replace those, but definitely NOT.  If you don't like the taste of splenda, don't buy this product!!!",1
"I used to buy 100% natural fruit roll-ups at a local fruit market down the street from me. They were sold individually for like 65 cents apiece and were AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS. They were nothing like the fruit roll ups for kids you find in the grocery stores today. Those things are gross and have no resemblance whatsoever to a real fruit roll up. I used to literally buy like $50 worth at a time and would just eat one after another after another. In particular the Apricot and Strawberry flavors were just outstanding. Anyways, I went to the market one day and they had gone out of business. That was about 8-9 years ago. I tried finding a different store that carried them and to this day I have been unsuccessful. I tried finding them using the internet but unfortunately I just cant remember the name of the company to save my life. I just remember they were sold individually, were round and actually quite large in diameter, and they came attached to a piece of cellophane.<br /><br />I came across Stretch Island Leathers on Amazon just a few weeks ago and got extremely excited after reading the description as it sounded exactly like a fruit roll up, just presented differently. While a Fruit Roll-up is large and thin, The Fruit leather is small and thick. Anyways I immediately order a box of the strawberry and anxiously awaited its arrival. I received my shipment 2 days later and immediately ripped open the box and dug in. They were exactly what I was looking for and they were just as delicious as I remembered them to be. I would up eating one after another after another, just like I used to do, until I had a fairly large pile of wrappers sitting in front of me. I honestly cant even express how excited I really am. Not only did I find what I was looking for, I found it on Amazon which means I can buy them in large quantities for a very reasonable price. On top of that Amazon offers them on a subscription based service so I don't even have to trouble myself with re-ordering more.<br /><br />The bottom line - Stretch Island Leathers are OUTSTANDING and my hunt is finally over. If you are a big fruit lover than you simply have to give these a try. Of course these are not just for adults, in fact these are absolutely perfect for kids especially if your trying to cut down on the amount of junk food your kids eat. They are all natural and have no added sugar. For those that have dietary restrictions, they are also gluten free and dairy free. I honestly cannot give a higher recommendation!!<br /><br />5 Stars!!!",5
"I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.<br /><br />TRY THIS INSTEAD: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCUBZ0"">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag</a>",1

After purchasing from the vet a few times I decided to check online and the price is significantly less and I don't have to make the trip to the vet.

Have been looking for a low fat/sodium kosher/pareve snack and so far this is among the best I've found. It's very tasty!,3
"I saw VerMints in a natural food store and immediately noticed the adorable illustrations. Second, they made ""Wintermint"" which is not available in all types of mint-making brands. Especially not those which are Vegi/Vegan friendly.<br /><br />I'm not sure how much more wonderful this flavor was before it ""reappeared"" in public. Its a light flavor. Think of it at the opposite end of the spectrum of something ""curiously strong."" I'd like to think its ""gently minty.""<br /><br />I can't wait to try the other flavors and collect the adorable tins!",4
"I bought the truffle oil to add distinctive subtle taste to certain foods.The infusion white truffle oil does add this earthy taste. It is a powerful taste and can be a turn off very quickly with too much, in that respect. You need to try it several times with not too much, not too little. (very much like saffron). This La Toursangelle oil is a good oil. Other truffle oils have a bit of the carrier oil taste. I don't have enough experience to compare all the truffle oils. I would use this truffle oil again but not to the exclusion of others.<br /><br />t",4
"Dark chocolate and raspberry are my two favorite flavors together, however, it is difficult to get a dark chocolate with enough cacao to give the health benefit you need to justify eating chocolate.  ;)<br /><br />I need a high protein bar that tastes good too and this did not fit the bill.",3
I really liked the pepper one! Difrent from any other vegi jerky i have had! I liked it tho! Jus a bit dry but that's the way real jerky is i guess wouldnt know since i been a vegi my whole life!!,3
"I only got to drink one cup of this to make this review, but I thought it tasted great.  What I like about good coffee flavor is that earthy, rich coffee taste that comes from quality coffee and just being fresh brewed.  I tested this right after the coffee maker had finished so it was as fresh as it could be.  I like a little honey and fresh cream in mine and I was sad I only got to have just one cup.  I had to share with others at home and they all liked it as well.  I couldn't tell if anything tasted different since it is supposed to be low acid.  It tasted like regular coffee to me.",4
"I'm not a new consumer of Ovaltine.  But if you've never had chocolate malt Ovaltine, then imagine a 'Whoppers' candy turned into a beverage, or a melted 'malted milkshake'.  I do understand that not everyone cares for malt, but for my 2 cents worth - this stuff should get 6 stars.  I can't always find this locally.  Usually I can get plain chocolate Ovaltine, but not the chocolate malt.  It's also seemingly unavailable at my local discount department store (Target.)  This 6 pack is priced comparably (you know, for when I can find it) and I got free shipping.  I'm just happy that I will have enough and know where to get it when I get low.",5
"I love Quakes for when I need a snack that is savory and not full of calories. My favorite is the Cheddar Cheese flavor, sort of like cheetos. I try to cut down the serving portion to about 12 pieces. Anyways, this flavor was new to me so I decided to give it a try. It was better than I was expecting it to be. It is sweet, but it has a hot kick to it. If you have ever had Mae Ploy sweet and spicy sauce, you will be reminded of that flavor. The sweetness might catch up to you however, and by about 12 or so, you will not want anymore. I think that they are good for an occasional snack.",4
"Everything is in the pouch, you don't have to look all over town for the different seasoning.",5
"This bar is super yummy, but I have to agree that falsely advertising it as an almond walnut macadamia bar, when most of the bar is peanuts, is a big turn off!",3
"This product is so light weight. It is easily tipped over. The plastic is not very heavy and if the dog is very rough with it at all, the doors can snap off, even break off which was the experience that I had with the first one I owned.<br />I would not recomment this product.",3
This is a very good chili and super simple to make but I only give it 3 stars because I think it is overpriced. The only thing innovative in this products is the small little packet of mixed spices. The rest of whats inside the bag are pinto beans and directions.  Oh and the tabasco sauce tied to the bag. This isn't worth the price to me. That being said....it does make for a neat gift for the person who loves chili. Its kind of like the cookie mix in the jar thing or a basket of treats. Its the presentation you are buying. Except this is chili powder in a cute bag with pinto beans and tabasco sauce. If it sold for less I would probably buy more people this as a winter gift. I know a lot of people that love chili.,3
Very disappointed. Way too much liquid - 3/4 can - and not enough vegetables. The vegetable and lentil is much thicker.,1
I ordered these for decoration on a construction themed birthday cake. They arrived so smashed that most of them aren't usable. Very disappointed.,2
"I have no issue with the product, which I actually love. However, for some reason, Amazon, or whoever is responsible for the shipping, decided to change the method for my last shipment. So, instead of receiving the product within 2 two days via UPS, they started using USPS snail mail, which took forever. I use the ""subscription"" service for a reason - so that I can count on the timely delivery of coffee and not run out. So, adding 5-6 days to the shipping time caused us to run out and have to make a trip to the store. Not cool. If delivery continues to be inconsistent, then there is no value to ordering this way, and I will go elsewhere.",2
"They are so easy to use since I have to give him a pill twice a day. Besides, my cat really likes them.",5
"This was good for pre-ground coffee. Being French roast it did have that characteristic stronger flavor. I'm not the biggest fan of that roast to start with, so take that into consideration. If you like it, chances are you'll like this product. My biggest attraction was the low acid. I couldn't tell for sure as it only made a couple of cups but I didn't have any excess acid reaction to the coffee. Not that I usually do, but occasionally I can experience some symptoms. None in this case. Not really a scientific study, but it is what it is. Very conveniently packaged. Try it.",4
"I was a huge fan of canidae, but beginning about a month ago, the company changed the formula to cheaper raw materials, smaller bags, and worst of all outsourced manufacturing to Diamond pet foods (yes, the same company linked to multiple recalls in the past). Please do a search on google/consumeraffairs.com. I will not be giving my dog this brand anymore. It's the same mass produced garbage as is iams, eureka, etc.",1
I buy these for my son every year for Christmas and they are all gone by New Years.  he would be crushed if I missed a year.,5
"Let me for the sake of fairness begin this review by stating that I and my family like our drinks very strong.  That said, it takes three or four of these bags to make a proper quart of sunbrewed tea, and then I still feel like it lacks real tea flavor, so I usually throw in a black or iced blend bag on top of those.  The blackberry flavor is very nice though - it is NOT sugary sweet.  Also, for those of us who like pretty food, the color is really beautiful when this is sitting in a glass pitcher.  :)",4
"I got the wholesome white bread mix, and I like the taste of it.  The only problem I have is I can't get it to rise in my bread machine.  I turns out great but it is a mini loaf.  I tried mixing it is the machine, and mixing it by hand and cooking it in my machine and I get the same results.  I have not tried making it in the oven which is another option.",3
"I thought these would be the perfect answer. Sadly, I guess the pressure with which my Keurig machine shoots the water through the k-cup is too much for the disposa cup, because every single time I tried it, coffee grounds were spewed up through the tiny hole in the lid of the disposa cup all over the inside of where the k-cup sits in my keurig. And yes, I used them properly.<br /><br />So the issue, at least in my Keurig machine, seems to be with the lids. Some have suggested its a design flaw with the Keurig machine. In either case, these disposa cups were NOT the answer for me.<br /><br />Biggest waste of money ever. I cannot recommend.",1
"I like this cereal (I add a few chocolate nibs and blue/strawberries), but was SHOCKED when I read the ingredient list: Aspartame! The ingredient (Aspartame) is not even in the latter portion of the list.....sighs....shocking.",2
"This product is manufactured and distributed by Apure Foods, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hershey's founded in 2010 ""to bring cocoa-based health and wellness products to consumers"", according to the Hershey's website.<br /><br />That being said, my wife and I thought it was pretty good. We both enjoyed it and will likely purchase it once in a while in the future.<br /><br />The taste took some getting used to, as it is not overly sweet-tasting. It is made with cocoa rather than chocolate, for example, and although brown sugar is ingredient no. 2 after oats, it tastes ""healthier"" than you would think after reading the ingredients list. The combination of the cocoa and cranberry flavors is unusual, and struck us as original.<br /><br />The nutritional information indicates that a 35-gram serving contains 24g carbohydrate (including 13g sugars and 3g fiber), 7g fat (including 2g saturated) and 3g protein.<br /><br />All in all, a good offering for those who can afford the carbs, and a surprise for me to learn that Hershey's even has a ""health and wellness"" segment.",4
"The product had an ""off"" smell to it. Like perhaps the oils in the coconut were turning rancid.  I was disappointed, I was expecting more of a pleasant coconut smell.",2
"Ordered this for my oldest son who is 21 an drinks Monster or Red Bull. His comments were that the taste of this was awful, and although he did feel an increased level of energy, he'd never buy this but would stick with Monster or Red Bull. I think that about sums it up - if a drink doesn't taste good to you, you're not going to buy it.",2
"I've tried both the Italian and Colombian Via varities, and while there's definitely a 'Starbuckiness' to both, neither is a substitute for the real thing. However there are times when the real thing just doesn't work, and at those times Via gets just enough things right to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />I'll start out with the negatives. Both varieties remind of drinking from a pot of 'yesterdays' coffee. The kind where you can't finish the pot of coffee and rather than toss it all out, you let it sit and cool overnight and then reheat it the next morning. The next day the coffee is always more bitter and the flavor is flat as compared to a fresh brewed cup. Adding milk or cream helps, but the underlying flavor is still a bit off-putting.<br /><br />Though the worst part about the Via brand is the after-taste. There's something off about it. I don't know quite how to describe it. Almost like a tinge of paper/cardboard taste to it which is a bummer. I find I drink a cup of Via faster than a normal cup of coffee in order to combat that after-taste.<br /><br />Having said all that, I think I'm still likely to continue buying the Via brand. I understand this is instant coffee. I mean I'm tearing open a little pouch (love the design), dropping in some hot water, and I've got coffee. Just like that. That's pretty great. That ease of use, and fairly reasonable pricing means that in circumstances in which convenience trumps quality I can find a place for Via. Camping, too lazy to drive to a coffee shop, otherwise stuck drinking Folgers, quick pick-me-up during a zombie invasion, etc... are a few examples of when a packet of Via could come in handy.",3
"It makes a decent wine, this is made to drink when the wine is young, while the wine is just OK at a young stage, it says aging will cause it to lose the fruity taste but since it makes about 30 bottles I think there will be quite a few that will be left to age. I have made wine before and it has turned out well and tasted good after aging. This kit has the ingredients necessary to make the wine but you do need to have your own fermenting container, carboy, the air locks, bottles and things like that. It is easy to do and the price is reasonable. The quality of the wine isn't great but it is acceptable.",4
"Walkers Products. Their shortbread line is wonderful. But the Highland Oatcakes ... really, really dry. And there is no compensation for the dryness ... like taste. Thought I was trying a new thing based on the Walkers brand. Guess I'll stick with what I know ... the shortbread.<br /><br />Walkers Highland Oatcakes are nothing to write home about. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.",2
"Coffee quality is as good as expected but, close to expiring. Next time, I will spend the extra few dollars and buy the coffee localy.",4
"I got the case of beans in the mail yesterday.  Today when I got a chance to open the box, every single can was dented.  The shrink wrapped case was placed in a bigger box and the shrink wrap had opened during shipment, but I don't think that all of the dents were because of this. The cans in the middle of the case were dented and had not come out of the shrink wrap.  I am going to write Amazon and Eden to see what they can do for me.",1
"I love this product.  It is not bitter, like stevia.  In fact, it is grandular and I cannot tell the difference between Ideal and real sugar. Ask your local grocery store to carry it.",5
I've tried several different flavors and I have yet to find one that I like. It has a nasty after taste and I can't stand that. This product is not for me :(,2
"I bought this flavor by accident as I had been buying the anchovy, sardine, salmon meal version of Holistic Select over the past year, and I wasn't paying attention. The chicken is $2 less than the anchovy & sardine one, but both our cats seem to like the anchovy & sardine better. Overall I will stick with Holistic Select because I believe it to be a high quality cat food, and worth the premium. One of our cats will not eat moist food if his life depended on it so we went with this brand which seems to be one of the best dry foods on the market. I just placed an order for the duck meal Holistic Select so we shall see if that one is a hit too.",4
"For those wanting dark chocolate, this simply is going to do the trick.  It's 54% cocoa solids and really quite sweet.  In terms of texture, it's a bit grainier than average.  It's not shiny, but kind of matte, and melts pretty reasonably.<br /><br />Each 2.25 oz (64g) bar has six large-ish squares, making portion control a little challenging.<br /><br />In terms of flavor, this definitely earns a solid three stars.  It's really not bad at all, like a very reasonable cocoa.  It's so sweet that it tastes a little like a really high end milk chocolate at first, with a good finish for a milk chocolate.  All in all, for a dark chocolate this is better than Dove (less ""smooth"" because it's grainier, but definitely a better finish), but can't hold a candle to a good high end dark chocolate like Lindt.<br /><br />In terms of organic chocolates, Green & Black makes a darker, smoother, better finishing chocolate, and the bars are bigger, too.",3
"I tried this tea, based on the 5 star reviews of the other reviewers. Perhaps none of the other reviewers have been to Japan or tried real Sencha.<br />I was severely let down. This tea is weak at best, and not a good representative of Japanese Sencha bagged tea.<br /><br />Instead I would recommend Maeda-en, Yamamotoyama, and MyGreenTea as better tasting and more authentic Sencha. Amazon sells all of those 3. Considering the price of Harney & Sons tea, spend your money on a better tea. Even Kirkland brand green tea has more flavor vs. Harney & Sons.",2
Bought it for the wife who is on a diet.  She likes it and keeps her on the diet.  How can I loose?,4
"I've found that most Glutino products taste quite good. However, I was very disappointed in the breakfast bars. I tried the apple and the blueberry. They both have kind of a bitter taste and you can hardly taste the fruit. They are edible but not very enjoyable. Some folks might feel differently about the taste but, if I were you, I would try one box from a health food store, before I ordered boxes and boxes of them from Amazon.",2
"We use this type of oil in a chicken marinade we just love.  The oil has a very very strong smell.  We are not unhappy with the product, but the oil just has a very very strong unpleasant smell.  We use 1/2 of the amount the recipe calls for.  Will not re-order this product again.",1
This product arrived on time just as it was advertised online! I can never find these anywhere and I crave them constantly!! So good!,5
"I received this product through the Vine program.  As described, this is a creamy chipotle sauce that has a pronounced flavor without being hot.  While a bit high on fat at 11 grams for a serving (two tablespoons), the flavor is strong enough that you can reduce the amount used to control the fat content.<br /><br />This sauce works well for wraps where you do not need a lot of sauce to carry the flavor.  It does not work as well in salads in that the tendency is to use more than a serving portion and that really can drive up the fat content of your salad(although the flavor is good)!<br /><br />Over all, I would recommend this product and only suggest a little self control in the portion size.",4
I bought 21 0z freeze dried liver. Half the container was filled with powder instead of pieces/chunks. I feel I was betrayed by the company. Hence I did not get what I paid for,3
"My dogs LOVE these and so has every foster dog that we have given it to.  These are a treat not a replacement for a meal.  They are full of great ingredients and none of the bad stuff.  They have a high protein and fat content but you shouldn't be giving your dogs 10 a day.  Honestly, we have dogs that range from 35-60 pounds and they only get a 1/2 a cookie at a time.  My husband is a veterinarian and he was impressed by the quality of the ingredients.  They are a great treat and we will definitely buy again.",4
"I had purchased this toy since they said it was durable for active chewing dogs. However, my 11 month old German Shephard/ Retriever tore this thing up in less than five minutes. I would recommend this for a dog that doesnt tear up its toys as it is cute and has two squeeky's in its mouth.",1
"HAVE ORDERED THIS BRFORE AND THIS TIME JUST DOESNT SEEM AS FRESH. WHEN I OPENED , THE CONTENTS SEEMED STALE, BUT THE DATE ON THE PACKAGE WAS OCT2013.....COULD HAVE BEEN A PIN HOLE IN BAG AND I COULDN'T FIND IT.",2
"My dog seems to really like these. I'm sure they're not the healthiest dog treat out there, but hey we all splurge sometimes. For some reason he won't eat the KONG while we're away from home, at work. But once we're home and he's had his walk he usually goes and finds his KONG and carries it out to the mat at the front door to enjoy his treat! I sometimes add peanut butter to it or plain yogurt. He digs it, the only problem is my dog gives up too easy. If the Ziggie breaks off leaving half of it too far for him to reach it, he's over it. He'll just leave it there, leaving me to have to dig it out for him later.",3
"I was delighted with the popcorn it came on time and used it for a kids party, everyone enjoyed it even the adults",4
"If I could give this no stars - that is how I would rate it.  Called extract, but is, in fact, artificial.  Misleading information - no indication in the detail that this is an artificial flavoring - be warned.  Only realised when I actually received the item.  Learn by my mistake.",1
Watch stores sales an you will get this item much cheaper. Cheaper in any store that sells cereal in the bags............,3
"Sadly, this tasted like nail polish remover smells.  Really bummed out as I love Seattle's Best Coffee Vanilla (a Starbucks-owned company).",1
Very good tasteing product but I need to use it the smallist setting on my B-60 to really enjoy the depth.,3
"I ordered the 1 lb. fruitcake (along with the 1 lb. date-nut cake), and when both of them came in one small brown box I got concerned. Like others who have ordered, I was a bit taken aback by how small it was. So I took my first bite with full intent of savoring it. It is very dense. It carries its weight in fruits and cake bread: pineapple, cherries, raisins, walnuts, pecans; the cake is lightly sweetened with honey and soaked in 120 proof brandy.<br /><br />The 1 lb. portion (16 oz.) contains 8 servings. Each serving is 2 oz., worth 220 Calories, 80 Fat Calories. Hopefully that gives you an idea of how dense this fruitcake is. It is packed with goodies. For its amount, personally I find it a bit overpriced, but if you can savor every bite, then it's worth it.<br /><br />By the way, I uploaded a photo of the 1 lb. fruitcake in my hand, just to give you a sense of size so you're not surprised when you order and receive it.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? Not immediately. I'd shop around and try other ones just to compare. I may or may not re-purchase, hard to say, but this was definitely worth a try.",4
"This looks great and is very sturdy, but it is very difficult to get the ice out because it is so stiff (can't twist it at all).  I turn it over and hope it works eventually.  Switched to the flexible ones.",2
"Herbs de Provence can bring many dishes to life. Baked chicken and root veggies are a good place to start, for those who are not familiar with this herb mix. Then expand the horizons by searching all the wonderful online recipes. Winter is coming; it's time to enhance those savory stews and one-pot dishes --- to take the plain to the extraordinary.<br /><br />I personally like this French gray salt and herb combination because I don't like to overdo it with the herbs. I prefer a more subtle flavor. However, if you prefer more herbal punch, you may want to stick with purchasing the herbs alone, or make your own mix, which is quite easy to do. Otherwise, you will be fighting with the salt.<br /><br />If you need to watch your sodium intake, you need to know that this product is heavy on the salt --- and the crystals are very large, so it is easy to over salt your dish. You will be fine, if you make adjustments for salt required for your particular recipe. This is just something to consider, when ordering this combo product.<br /><br />I can attest to the freshness of this product.  Upon opening the glass jar, the fragrance was very potent and lovely. I also prefer having the herbs in a jar with a twist-on-lid.  This will help maintain freshness.<br /><br />All said, I highly recommend this product, with the reservations mentioned. These concerns are manageable. Just remember that this product is predominately salt, with herbs as the secondary enhancement, but the herbs won't go unnoticed.",4
I have had this product on auto ship for several months without problem.  Last order I recieved did not work properly.  Cup over flowed coffee for what ever reason would not allow coffee to flow though.  I tried everything to fix problem.  Brought new cups and work fine so was cups.  Have one more order on way if work no problem but if over flow again will cancel.,1

"When I saw this product at one of my favorite kitchen stores, I just had to try it out, especially since I love this coffee cake and the Barefoot Contessa show.  I figured it would be a great mix.  I was very disappointed after baking the product that the cake itself was very dry and the crust was very hard.  The flavor was there, but might need to add pudding to the mix or something else to add moisture to it.  For the price of $14.95 that I had paid, it's probably worth it to just buy one already made from a local bakery.  Definitely not worth the price paid.  Sorry, Ina!",1
"This is an intense, rich, flavorful coffee. While I like a robust flavor, this one seems quite acidic. It does ""chase fog"", for sure! I think it has a real caffeine kick to it. The cups are intersting in that they have a wider brim so they fit right into the Keurig without touching the bottom poker. I brewed a 12oz. cup and a 16oz. cup. The 16 was more to my liking, but the acidity of the coffee made it difficult to finish either cup. Just a little too strong for my liking. Interesting packaging. We drink several cups a day, so I don't believe it would get stale. And they do fit right in the carousel.",3
I first tried this at Walmart and I believe they have them at Trader Joe's as well as at Walgreen's.<br />It's a healthier alternative to eating potato chips- although they are quite addicting and the temptations to down the whole bag is great...<br /><br />It's a good snack if you like the cheddar popcorn or just have a craving for a salty snack.,4
The dogs absolutely love them but their odor is awful - like rotting fish. I have bought this product many times and noticed that some batches smell much worse than others.,3
"I'm certainly no Paprika expert, but we bought this after reading glowing reviews from Mark Sisson <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982207743"">Primal Blueprint Quick and Easy Meals: Delicious, Primal-approved meals you can make in under 30 minutes (Primal Blueprint Series)</a>.  Its OK.  I guess its maybe better than the stuff we get at the grocery, but not worth the $$ in my opinion",3
"I did not enjoy this coffee. This is more of that old world kind of beverage. You are drinking and feel transported 200 years ago, when they did not have keurig's and startbucks, if you know what I mean. It almost feels dusty. Not enough boldness, not enough flavor, not enough depth. Not for me.",3
"I started running a couple years ago, and I ran my first marathon last year.  I always carry PowerGel with me on my long runs.  Yes PowerGel is just sugar and caffine, but when I'm bonking 15 miles into a 20 mile run, I am super glad I have one in my pocket.  I think the benefit comes mainly from the sugar, but I do tend to buy the flavors with 25mg of caffine.  In general I give PowerGel 4 to 5 stars, but I'm giving the Tangerine flavor two stars because I didn't like the taste.  All the other flavors are much better.",2
"I have Purchased these Chestnuts Several times and both me and my sister enjoy eating them. They do come in pouches and are slightly moist. I was surprised by that at first, but I found that it doesn't detract from the taste but instead makes sure you don't end up with a dry mouth after eating them. The pouch is moist and that is what makes the Chestnuts moist, if the Chestnuts remain outside of the pouch they are no longer moist.<br />Recommended.",5
"Both the mild & hot are amazing, but we prefer the hot!  GREAT on hotdogs, grilled chicken and even BBQ!!!!",5
"their New Recipe for 70% is totally atrocious and horrible.<br />It's greasy, cheap tasting with soy lecithin  ""to aid the chocolate flowing and molding properly"" according the their QA.<br />I don't buy it because their other bars are just fine without soy. Keep in mind that the lecithin is most likely derived from GM soy.<br />Many people are allergic to soy - they don't care!<br />Shame on Lindt! I'm glad others hate it too, maybe they will get a message.<br />You may just as well buy cheaper brand from the candy machine.",1

Idiots!  Why destroy the health benefits of one of the best breakfast cereals on the market by adding sugar to it??!!  They might as well have added more salt while they were at it! I'm sure that would have made the cereal taste better too. I don't know anyone who is happy with the new Special K Protein Plus recipe. They need to restore the original!  Until then they have lost my business.,1
"My shipment was all over 2 months overdue.  Too much flavor lost by then, and too dry.",2
I expected more than it turned out to be. My family seemed to like it but they weren't too crazy about it. I'm more excited about donuts than these cookies.,1
"I never heard of Reggie's before I ordered some here on sale. Good, finely ground coffee with a nice aroma!",5
"I had tried Green Mountain Sumatra Reserve and found it delicious and strong. It's not available on ""subscribe and save"" so I read the reviews and opted for Wolfgang Puck. My husband likes it and I like the flavour but it's very weak in comparison to the Green Mountain. I have to order something else for me.",3
"We love the Muir Glen line of Organic Tomatoes.<br />I use them for everything now - Soups, Chili, Salsa, pasta sauce and more!<br />The fire roasting gives foods a great flavor and my wife loves the fact they are organic.",5
"I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though.",3
"(I'm not sure why it isn't marked as such, but this is a Customer review from the Amazon Vine(tm) Program.)<br /><br />On the plus side, it's easy to make: you only dirty a skillet and spoon.<br /><br />On the minus, it doesn't taste like much of anything. For all the seasoning and cheese, it still seems like it needs salt. It doesn't taste like any cheeseburger I've had...or even like one of those beefy mac dishes. It's just bulky stuff that lays in your stomach.<br /><br />I really can't recommend this to anyone.",1
"I like a robust coffee, and for a k-cup, this very nearly delivers the flavor and strength I like.  I would buy it again.",4
"I have purchased directly from the Coffee Bean Direct website many times with great success.  While ordering a few items from Amazon I noticed that they also sold here and my order was eligible for Super Saver Shipping, so I added a bag to my order.  When ordering direct from CBD the order arrives with strong aroma before you even open the package and the roast date is literally only days ago.  The bag I ordered through Amazon arrived in the same box as my other items and that made me wonder, as I expected it to arrive directly from New Jersey and CBD.  The bag didn't have the strong aroma and I noted the Julian date code on the bottom of the bag and it was 43 days ago.  I think the product description is a bit deceiving as it is the same as on their website.  The beans maybe roasted with 24hrs of packaging, but take into account they must send bulk amounts to the Amazon hubs and these may site for weeks or months before being shipped to customers.  Still good coffee, but nothing compared to buying directly from them.",4
"Thanks to all prior reviews to help me decide to give this a try and I'm hoping that my experience can encourage You!  It is not a no tear/poke trash bag.  My compromise to the poking or wetness issue is to use a newspaper lining for between the bag and the trash can along with a container of baking soda then one more sheet of newspaper inside the bag.  This helps with absorbing the condensation and prevent common tears.  I know, I'm wasting paper.  But, if I don't find a responsible routine or green item that is convenient, the Family will not be so eager to follow!  My theory is that I'm only being about 90% eco-conscious with a product that can be 100% good.  But, if I don't find a way, we will only be frustrated and falsely find these bags not working for us at all and going back to the mere 10% responsible minded citizens using recycled bags (which is still great for our kitchen recycling trash!).  The kitchen trash goes to the outside garbage 1/2 to 2/3 full every 3 to 4 days (the smell starts and we did not want to stuff it only to have it tear). These BioBags are more expensive than the traditional trash bags, but this routine works well with our family, and we feel better if our regular trash is going straight to the landfill w/o stopping off at the possible recycling sorting facility as our area have a great independent recycling system with lots of toxic/hazardous round up opportunities and locations.",4
"Good pistachios, but...about 20% of the bag is empty shells. I'll need to reevaluate before I order this brand again.",4
"I agree with the other reviewers that the chocolate can be a tad crumbly, but this only occurred with my first order, and the taste of these bars is still absolutely AMAZING!!<br /><br />These bars are gluten free, have three basic ingredients (coconut, rice syrup, dark chocolate), and are a wonderful treat that I don't feel terrible after eating.  Try a box and you'll soon find out how incredibly delicious they are.",5
"I received a box with 11 bags, not 12. I noticed that another reviewer had the same problem. Also, in some of the puffs there are some really hard bits, which is weird. I hurt my tooth. I normally love this stuff but I won't buy it from Amazon again, even though the price is much cheaper than at grocery stores.",2
"Yes they are organic and no preservatives or high fructose crapola, but this product uses white flour.  That means no hull on the wheat and no fiber... as was intended by nature.  Also it has a lot of sugar and thus high calories.<br />They taste very good, like a dessert.  It is easy to eat two at a time but with so much white flour and sugar they can add weight to you and raise blood sugar levels.<br />I recommend only eating on occasion and as a small treat or dessert in order to curb a sweet tooth.  It is not a good choice for a breakfast item.",3
"Last month after my local pet store ran out of the Cosmic cat grass my cats had long been using to fight off hairballs,  I came here to Amazon, found two products that looked interesting and bought  one of each.  I had very disappointing luck with this one.  I  read the instructions and followed them clearly, paying particular attention to keeping the soil moist and warm and the light dim until germination. I used an 8-inch garden pot and the same Miracle Grow potting soil that had worked wonders in my outdoor garden pots.  But the results were disappointing.  All I got were a scattered few strands of grass.  A  second attempt, using more seeds and a different, smaller pot netted the same meager results.<br /><br />Meanwhile my other purchase, the Pet Greens Garden Wheat Grass Self-Grow Kit--which came with similar instructions, but  its own soil, disposable planter pouch and far fewer seeds at twice the price--produced a veritable thicket of grass that kept  growing and growing and, despite daily grazings from three cats,  lasted  five full weeks.<br /><br />I still have some Nibble-Licious seeds left, so would gladly appreciate comments from those of you who've had good results with  this product on what you did right that I may have done wrong and how to fix it.<br /><br />\<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006348H2"">Pet Greens Garden Wheat Grass Self-Grow Kit</a>",2
"I love ginger snap cookies, and finding good ones is really difficult unless you bake them yourself. I had high hopes for these but my hopes were dashed when I got them and tried them.<br /><br />Right off the bat, I noticed they had a lot of ginger in them....enough to leave a slight tingle on the tongue as an aftertaste. This is great if you love ginger like I do, but could be a problem for some people.<br /><br />I noticed when I opened the bag and grabbed a handful that some of the cookies were too dark and had been over baked. A little darkening on the bottom is fine, but when the sides are starting to get a little burnt and you get a burnt taste, they are overdone and need to be thrown out. Either the ovens need better temperature control, or the inspectors need to be more careful.<br /><br />Finally, I was pleased with the ingredients until I read the list closely. While using organic flour and organic sugar made these seem very healthy, I noticed that the shortening used was palm oil. They used a fancy name for it, but it is basically just palm oil, which is the vegetable oil that is highest in saturated fat content of all the vegetable oils. Why they would use such great organic ingredients and then have an unhealthy fat in them is a mystery to me. It is also a deal breaker.  I guess I go back to baking them for myself.....",3

"This is by far my favorite popcorn of all time. Petite, fluffy kernels are delicious and light as air. I pop this several times a week in my Back to Basics popper. One thing to keep in mind: the kernels pop up quite a bit smaller than ordinary corn, so you should measure out more, to fill up the popper. For instance, normally I measure out nearly a half-cup of ordinary corn, but for the Vintage Red I usually use almost 3/4 cup. Happy popping!",5
"I cannot recommend buying this product.  I think the manufacturer is fobbing off its dented cans on Amazon customers!  Out of a package of 12 cans, only 3 were not dented in the package I received -- and I see from other reviews that I am not the first to experience this.  I wish I'd read the reviews before placing my order.  I don't think this was an Amazon fault, since the flat was pre-packaged and I think Amazon simply shipped the flat as they received it from the manufacturer.  Amazon took immediate and very good care of me in this situation, exceeding my expectations, so I have no quibble with them.",2
"This is a very delicious snack. At 130 calories per pack, it's not terrible for you either. You won't be disappointed in this snack.",5
"Not sure why but the texture bothered me with these, the smoothness of the straws is weird. And they have very little substance and taste. The upside is there are a lot in the bag so I guess if you eat them all, you feel like you had a snack. They're just not for me :(",2
"My order arrived leaking, which was an annoyance. That in and of itself isn't a reflection of the product. I wish ""Clear"" brand made a shampoo for men NOT geared for dandruff since my guys don't actually have dandruff. My younger son has a lot of trouble with hair breakage and thus thinning hair, so I hoped a shampoo designed for a healthy scalp would benefit him. He's been using the product every day and his hair seems to be tangling more. It isn't long hair, by the way.<br /><br />While Clear Men Scalp Therapy may be advertised as a shampoo for a healthier scalp, the product doesn't appear to work any better than any other shampoo on actual hair. If anything, it seems to leave hair drier than Pantene or even Suave products. Bottom line? I suppose if one's hair is on the oily side with dandruff, this could be an OK shampoo. Personally? I'd think other products would work just as well or better.",3
"Delicious, no artificial taste whatsoever.  A brand name at a great price.  Save plenty,  vs. buying small packages at the market.  Plus, I love the cherry gummi bears, and these are ALL cherry gummies.",5
My dog is 3 and he has been chewing and licking his paws for as long as I can remember.  Probably half his day was spent chewing and licking.  He has had many steroid shots and has been taking claritin twice a day for several months.  Nothing has worked....I decided to try this dog food before taking him to a specialist and it has been amazing.  He has been eating the salmon and potatoes formula exclusively for about a week and a half and now he is hardly ever licking his paws!!!  Today I even skipped his claritin and he has not licked his paws all day.  No more grains for my dog!,5

"Ordered the 34 count and it was Extremely disappointing.  I expected to get at least one-two of every flavor shown on the 34 count sampler.  I would say about 24 are either Hazelnut or Vanilla.  Which are last I need since I buy Hazelnut by the 80 pack carton at BJs.  No Mudslide, no Butter Toffee, No Donut House Cinnamon Roll, No Hawaiian, No Limited Edition. No Khalua, No Cappucino, No Timothy's coffee.  This is a farce and I am so disappointed in Amazon.  I have never had a problem before but this was really a ""bait and switch"" as far as I am concerned.",1
This bar just tastes plain weird.<br />There. I said it.<br /><br />I love KIND PLUS bars in general...they are like candy but with nuts and other awesome things.<br /><br />The Mango one tasted like Mango and coconut - and entirely TOO SWEET. Almost sickeningly so. Won't be buying the mango one again.,1
"This was the most incredible soda I had ever drank, it still goes by the original 1800's medicinal recipes, & tastes amazing & seems healthy compared to most sodas. However two days later I found you can order 12 bottles for only 10$ from the official website of the maker of the product [...] & felt ripped off that I paid 6$ for 3 here on Amazon when I could have gotten 12 for 10$ at the KutzTown website.",4

"Science Diet, like Walmart brand Ol Roy dog food is made up primarily of corn and other known dog allergens. My last dog had so many health problems and allergies as a result of being fed nothing but SD. Now I'm better informed on dog nutrition and only buy 4 or 5 star foods according to dogfoodadvisor.com and practice the rotation diet. Never again will I subject a dog to overpriced, crappy food when you can get the good stuff for the same price or less. Even if you have to pay more for better food it works out cheaper because they'll have fewer health problems.",1
"Like many others, the price point of this coffee got my attention but what's the point of cheaper coffee that's all but undrinkable... Grove Square, anyone?<br /><br />So before ordering on price alone I wanted to see other reviewers contrast and compare this blend to other k-cups such as Timothy's Midnight Magic, Emeril's Extra Bold or Jet Fuel. After all, given the wide disparity of opinion about which k-cup blend is bold, strong or rich in flavor, at least finding common ground with others who enjoy the aforementioned brands you can estimate the appeal of the flavor to your own palate.<br /><br />At the time I placed my order I didn't find any clear indicators from other reviewers along these lines, hence for what it's worth, as one who enjoys the previously mentioned k-cups, I can say that overall San Francisco Bay French Roast measures up pretty darn well to the more expensive brands.<br /><br />Now if cost were not a factor I'm not certain this would be my first choice as this blend has a somewhat smoky after taste and I prefer a more fruity or sweet flavor. But hey, this is French Roast and as such the taste seems well suited.<br />Nevertheless, no regrets...it's a nice bold brew (with an appealing price) that I look forward each morning.",4

"Love this product! I'm committed to a low-carb lifestyle and find it easy most of the time. However, there was one carb I missed; Asian noodle dishes, like pad thai. I got the angel-hair sized noodles, and they look like rice noodles, and come packaged in a liquid filled bag. I was surprised by the weight of the shipping box. They are made from plant fiber so no calories, carbs, sugar, wheat, etc. Crazy impossible, right?<br />I used these in a chicken dish with a spicy sauce, and they were really enjoyable, not funky, and cured my Asian noodle craving. The consistency is very similar to ""al dente"" rice noodles in pad thai.<br />So if you are watching carbs, calorie, sugar, gluten, etc. and are looking for a pasta alternative, check them out.",5
"Nice brand and excellent quality with lightly salted, Bought halves instead of full for hefty price. These are generally fresh tasting out of the tin",5

"I've been using the Madhava organic blonde sugar now for about 2 weeks.  I don't use a lot of sugar on a daily basis but I have used it in my coffee and tea instead of my usual agave syrup and used it on some hot cereal.  I found that I needed to use a bit more of the coconut sugar to get the drink/food up to the sweetness level I like, but all in all it tastes fine.  I don't know what the glycemic index is of the coconut sugars but that data would definitely determine whether I continued to use it more regularly (since I seem to need to use more).  I tried the darker coconut sugar too and will review that on the relevant page.)",4
"If my cats could leave reviews they would probably give this product a 1 star. Fortunately they can't, so I'm giving it a 3 stars for effort :)  I realize that different cats used to different foods, however mine for some reason would rather starve than eat turkey formula cat food from Wellness. Otherwise I trust Wellness brand, they seem to put good ingredients, and no grains.<br />Also there was no mentioning anywhere about quantity. It comes in 12 large cans.<br />Before getting it tho, I suggest you go to local Petco and get a smaller can of same Turkey formula and check if your cats will eat it.",3
"We make our sweet tea in our house from tea bags.  I was curious to give this water enhancer a try to see if it would be a good substitute for days when I just didn't feel like making a whole gallon of tea.  While I found it to be ok, it really didn't satisfy me as a good substitute for our tea.  The bottle was also a little difficult to use--sometimes it would put out a drop or two and then other times it would squirt out a bunch.  I'm sure there's a trick to evening the flow but I couldn't do it.<br /><br />As a side note, this is much pricier than buying other drinks (e.g. soft drinks), particularly when you calculate the added cost of bottled water if you use that.  I probably wouldn't buy this again.",3
"I had never realized how popular Dunkin' Donuts coffee was until I saw all these ""donut"" k-cup coffee clones.  I've tried Dunkin Donuts, Donut Shoppe and Donut House varieties.  The Donut House flavor is the mildest/smoothest of the 3 with a muted bitter aftertaste and, of the 3, I like it the least.  The Donut House brand comes in 2 additional flavors, Chocolate Donut and Cinnamon.  Both are flavored additions of their base coffee.<br /><br />The Cinnamon Roll smells fantastic while brewing and hints at the promise of sweet tasting coffee.  Alas, that hint is all you get.  The coffee tastes the same as the base mild/smooth Donut House coffee flavor but has a slight (very slight) cinnamon flavoring (not sugar cinnamon like on toast, certainly not a ""cinnamon roll"" taste, but more like they sprinkled actual cinnamon spice into the coffee).<br /><br />I use 10oz mug sizes so I tried an 8oz size to see if that affected the taste.  It did make for a stronger coffee taste but the flavor tasted the same, maybe slightly more bitter.<br /><br />It's not a bad coffee, and I kinda like the milder flavor for evening drinking but if I get it again, I'll stick with the Donut House plain flavor.",3

"I bought this last year to go along with my new home espresso machine. I love Ghiradelli dark chocolate so I was really excited to try this in my cafe mochas.

"The coffee  beans were not as dark roasted as expected, resulting in a rather weak cup of coffee.",2
"Didn't taste like grape to me, it tasted more like purple lemonade.  It has a very very faint artificial  'grape' taste, but seriously, if the drink didn't have a slightly purple tint to it and it wasn't labelled as such, you'd probably never suspect it was grape at all.  Now in all fairness, the flavor's not especially bad, but if it's lemonade you're after, why not just buy the Lemon Lime flavored 'Pure Fitness' powder - it's really quite good and as others have also mentioned, it doesn't cause the headaches that aspartame does.",3
"As a frequent NOW customer, I was surprised at the poor quality of their coconut oil.  It was yellow, cloudy, and smelled so rancid that I didn't dare eat it.  NOW usually sells good products, so maybe I just got a rare bad batch of coconut oil - who knows?  I think I'll stick with Nutiva organic VCO, which has never disappointed me.",1

"The gift basket arrived this morning.  In usual Amazon style, the basket was packaged very well for shipping (double boxed).  However, when I opened the inner box, I was immediately disappointed.  The basket looked nothing like the main picture on Amazon.  All SIX (6) sample-sized gluten free treats were packaged flatly inside the crocodile leather-LOOKING cardboard basket.  NOTE: If you click on 'other views' there is a picture of how the basket actually appears upon arrival.<br /><br />The basket contained (SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION):<br />Almond Crunch<br />Black Truffle + White Cheddar Popcorn<br />Garden Select Vegetable Chips<br />Ginger Snaps<br />Sea Salt and Cracked Pepper Kettle Chips<br />Valdosta Pecans<br /><br />I found the overall dimensions to be only 11.5L x 7.5D x 4.5H at the WIDEST points.  The basket is still moderately attractive, but not nearly as attractive as pictured.<br /><br />I had ordered the basket as a birthday gift for a dear friend with Celiac Disease.  She was very touched I had found a basket of treats which were specifically suitable for her condition.  However, as she opened the basket, I was somewhat embarrassed at how little each package contained.  Each product realistically offered nothing more than a generous handful of the snack.<br /><br />I would estimate the retail value of each of the six snacks included to be between $1 and $2.  As stated, the basket itself is nothing more than embossed cardboard of low-end dollar store quality.  The ribbon, shrink wrap and shredded paper filler might add another dollar or two to the cost.  And, of course, we have to take into consideration that as a ""free shipping"" item through Amazon, the shipping cost is most likely around $10.  With shipping making up nearly half of the cost, I estimate the value of the basket to be roughly $25 SHIPPED.  I believe the basket and contents itself to be worth more like $15.<br /><br />At $34.99, I do NOT believe the basket is a good value.  If you look carefully, you will note beside the price it states ($26.92/lb).  You should use that notation as your 'value indicator.'<br /><br />In conclusion, the basket DOES make an impression as a THOUGHTFUL gift for someone who has a special condition.  However, you could make a basket of your own gluten free treats for a far better value.",2
"This is a very good product with a super Waffle Recipe on back - wow they are good!<br />A little pricey but, I buy Pearl Sugar by the case on Amazon.com and it brings the cost down.  Also available on eBay from my Danish friend who lives in the south (USA).<br />The waffles that you make with this product are called Liege Belgian Waffles. NOT DIET FOOD AND VERY ADDICTING - even cold they are outrageously good. Slap some Vanilla Ice Cream with berry of your choice - over the top!<br /><br />For a Liege Waffle recipe we will need:<br />2 cups flour<br />1 cup pearl sugar<br />1 cup melted butter<br />3 eggs<br />1 (1/4 ounce) package yeast<br />1/3 cup lukewarm water<br />1 1/2 tablespoons sugar<br />1/8 teaspoon salt<br />2 to 3 teaspoons Pure Mexican Vanilla - substitute store brand Pure Vanilla<br />  (Tip - Mexican or any other vanilla should not contain syrup or sugars of any kind this is a cheap filler)<br /><br />How to make Liege Waffles in nine easy steps:<br />1. Take the lukewarm water and mix in yeast, 1 1/2 tablespoon sugar and salt. Let the yeast develop for 15 minutes. In the meanwhile you can melt the butter, but be careful - do not burn it.<br /><br />2. Now take a large bowl and put in the flour, make a hole in the middle, pour in the yeast that you made in step one. Also add eggs and melted butter and knead until you get nice and even dough. Then let it rest so the yeast does it's magic and the dough doubles.<br /><br />3. Now take pearl sugar and gently mix it in.<br /><br />4. Again, let it rest for 15 minutes, in the meanwhile you can turn on the waffle maker so its nice and hot.<br /><br />5. All there is left is to pour the waffle dough into the waffle maker and bake for 3-5 minutes. Because we mixed in the sugar late in the process it will melt and caramelize and give that special Liege waffle taste. Just be careful when you take them out of the waffle maker, caramelized sugar can make them sticky.<br /><br />NOTE there are different kinds of Pearl Sugar - know what you are buying and for what!",5

"Well, back to Mama noodles we go...<br /><br />I had high hopes when my friend I was visiting in Portland was using these for a quick long-day-at-work meal-between-meals. THEN I read the label.<br /><br />Hydrolyzed soy protein.<br /><br />Not only is soy already bad for your health beyond a quick-reached 10g a day ""healthy moderation"" level, but hydrolyzed soy (hydrolyzed ""vegetable protein"" almost always being soy, too) is full of MSG. It's not alone-- autolyzed yeast, corn-sourced maltodextrin (which is nearly all maltodextrin anymore), the list goes on, but in short they are all MSG... only unlike Europe, America does not require that special ""enhancer"" code for various food additives and we as a result have to constantly be stealthy (thanks, Monsanto).<br /><br />So that said, I did taste a bit of it, trusting his comment of no MSG (it makes my head and stomach both feel like a vice grip is being tightened on them)... and as I am sensitized to the weird not-salt flavor of it, I stopped and asked politely to see the package. Sure enough, glaring at me is MSG... For taste, I'd give it 3 stars overall--the MSG taste isn't super-strong, but it is apparent enough to set off all my alarms nonetheless, so I couldn't enjoy it.<br /><br />For ethics, it's a miserly negative 10 stars...",2

"If you know anything about canine nutrition, or care enough about your pet to want to feed them something that's good for them, you won't pick this food. Yes, it's better than Wallyworld's Old Roy (which fails my two tests below much worse than this does), but it's far from great. Here's why:<br /><br />Like all other crappy dog foods (95% of what's on the shelf at the store), corn is a major ingredient of this dog food (#1 on the ingredients list! Couldn't be worse). Dogs do not digest corn well. It makes for terrible dog food. And the meat that's included is of the ""by-product"" variety. So, it's ground chicken bones and toenails, not muscle tissue (""meat""). So why are these things in there? They're cheap. Filler. That's it.<br /><br />Here are my own personal rules for selecting a good dog food:<br /><br />1. If the word ""corn"" appears ANYWHERE in the ingredients, I pass. It's not good for the dog. Other grains are more okay: rice (preferably brown, not brewers), etc. A few non-corn grains are fine, but you don't want your pet eating mostly grains. While omnivorous (most fruits and veggies are great), dogs are Carnivores.<br /><br />2. Meat must be high on the ingredients list, preferably in the #1 position (""meal"" is okay; just means dried meat. ""By-products"" are not okay).<br /><br />Those two rules pretty much guarantee you'll weed out the junk. And yes, Science Diet is junk, despite what your vet told you.<br /><br />3. My $ rule: $1 a pound or less, because I'm frugal. This is about the price point where great dog foods are obtainable (that doesn't mean all expensive dog foods are good; in fact, all of the big brands (purina, iams, eukanuba, science diet, etc) are all well-marketed, overpriced junk). The only major exception to the ""good food usually costs more"" rule that I've noticed is Costco's dog food, which is actually pretty good, and only about 25 bucks for a 40 pound bag. Best deal in canine nutrition, I think.<br /><br />Where'd I get my info? A lot of research. Start with a google search for the Whole Dog Journal's annual review of dog foods. It's the most authoritative thing out there.  Additionally, my wife is a dog trainer (the Best Friends type, not the Cesar Milan type; corn is to dog food what the ""dog whisperer"" is to dog training: junk) and works at our local humane society, where they get to test a LOT of donated foods.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and I teach the Mammalogy course at our local university. I understand mammalian anatomy and digestion.<br /><br />If you care about your pet, do your homework, people. And please don't use the ""but my dog likes this brand"" test. I love ice cream, and would eat it at every meal if I could, but my wife tells me it's not good for me. Cheap dog foods are loaded with grease to make dogs want it. Doesn't make it healthy.",3

What I received was a great selection of coffees, no repeats, lots of flavors, different blends and roasts.  All in all a great product!",4

"This is a fruit juice added wine kit similar to Island Mist but lacking the quality. The fruit additive smells and tastes extremely chemical in nature, like a bathroom cleaning product, and the finished wine carries this hint of bathroom over with it. It is sweet and may appeal to some people, but I do not recommend it for any but the most unsophisticated palate.",2
"My 8 month old pit mix pup chews everything, including the landscaping, seat belts, and our English mastiff.  This product apparently has a wonderful flavor; he worked on it non-stop.  At 48 pounds he's a decent chewer, but certainly not the jaws of death, yet he managed to chomp off 1"" sized chunks within 20 minutes.  I had to throw the bone away a half hour after opening it.  I didn't want to chance the good flavor tempting  him to swallow the pieces.<br /><br />That said, flavored Nylabone products are generally big hits here, so I quickly ordered two chicken flavored Soupers.  They don't offer the same satisfaction as being able to knaw off a piece and therefore are not chewed on as often, but they last years and have been a safe option in our house of many dogs.<br /><br />I'd recommend the Flexible Bones for little, really young pups and weak chewers.",3
A very refreshing hot beverage. Just not what i wanted. Its very sweet and sticky. Wont dissolve in cold or normal water. You have to use warm water/milk. I cant use it in my protein shake. The Chocolate version gets my 5 stars. This is junk for me.,3
"They recently redesigned the packaging for these; instead of a foil tab that you pull up or punch through, you have a foil-covered hole just barely big enough for the straw.  Want to pour it into another container, such as a glass or a sippy?  Find yourself a pair of scissors.  Your child pushes the expandable straw in?  Find those scissors.  It's a horrible design, and when I pointed this out to them I was brushed off with ""our testing showed this was better.""  I'm wondering if anybody who works there is a parent of a little kid.<br /><br />The milk itself is good, but this packaging just makes it a royal pain.",2
"I prefer rich, strong coffee and this product is a bit bland for my taste",3
"Good stuff....but.  I'd gotten some at Walmart but didn't really pay attention to the price (for one bag).  I enjoyed it so much that I searched for it on Amazon (in bulk) and ordered three different flavors.  I happened to be in Walmart the next morning and discovered to my surprise that it was significantly cheaper there.  (Walmart $3.50 for a 3.5oz bag, Amazon about $23.00 for ten 1.5oz bags - almost 50 cents an ounce more from Amazon plus you have to purchase it in bulk).  I find that I tend to order blindly from Amazon when I'm actually purchasing from Amazon and not a third-party vendor because I'm so used to fantastic savings.  This was a bit of a wake-up call.  I will give kudos to Amazon for their customer service policies, though.  I was able to cancel my order relatively hassle free.",3
"I've been an Illy advocate most of my life having worked in an espresso bar for several years where Illy was served exclusively.  I brew coffee in both my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A2BU3Y"">Saeco 30013 Aroma Traditional Espresso Machine, Stainless Steel</a> and my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CNY6UK"">Bialetti 6800 Moka Express 6-Cup Stovetop Espresso Maker</a> and Illy ground has always worked well.  Still, this Lavazza four-pack is less than half the price of Illy, so I decided to give it a go.  Using both methods, the Lavazza produces a delicious full-bodied cup of coffee.  I still prefer Illy slightly, but I will relegate Illy to times when I want to spoil myself.  Lavazza is the better choice for an everyday espresso for me.",4
"I have been an avid Canidae supporter for about a year and a half.  My breeder recommended it and I was VERY impressed with how my dog responded.  However, a few months back they changed their formula, (they also lessened the bags from 40 to 35lbs AND raised the price!!!!) and it is terrible!!!!  I went through 2 bags and couldn't understand why my dog was consistently producing loose stools, when she never had before.  Randomly, I found 1 bag of the old formula left at my local dealer so I bought it.  Immediately her stools firmed up.  Now I am again on a bag of the new formula, and again my dog is sick.  I am done, I will no longer support Canidae.  Do not buy it!  Do your research, at this kind of money there are A LOT of better dog foods out there.",1
"The first few daysI noticed a difference,after that I am not sure, I can't say I see much of an increase in my supply, of course my child is two years old and nursing is more of a comfort thing for him. But I keep drinking the tea, I just like it.<br /><br />Lisa",3

"We have a 5 year old mixed breed dog who weighs about 85 pounds on good days.  Frankly, she has had a rough time of it.  She caught the very tail end of the dog food crisis, ended up with kidney problems that rear their ugly heads now and then, and has become the world's pickiest dog food eater.  Chances are good that if she will eat any given dog food, it is a 50-50 proposition as to whether or not her kidneys will act up.  As a result, Miss Ted's people have tried any number of dog foods - the cheap stuff, the expensive stuff, the special diet stuff, the stuff from Walmart, the stuff from the grocery store, the stuff from the pet store, the stuff from the vet, even the refrigerated stuff, so I was happy to be given a chance to try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VJ0B0I"">PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound</a>.<br /><br />The bag arrived beautifully packaged and unlike his normal habit of simply leaving things on the porch, the UPS driver carried this all the way upstairs for  me.  (I  was very grateful.) Miss Ted happened to be in one of her ""that stuff is poison and I'm not going to touch it so I'll just eat the cat's food until I can get into the pantry for some real people food"" mood, so her bowl remained untouched.  We tried another half-dozen times over a period of 10 days or so and got the same reaction every time. The dog food looks fine and smells fine, but Miss Ted won't eat Beneful - even if she hasn't eaten anything but the cat food in a couple of days.<br /><br />Others have pointed out some of the controversy surrounding this particular dog food, as well as the low rating given to the product by the Dog Food Advisor due to the high fat and carbohydrate levels.<br /><br />Grandma's $0.02:  if you are feeding strays like Grandma did out West, then this might be a good option and having the dog food delivered is a fantastic service.  On the other hand, if you have a ""special needs"" dog, the is probably not the best option.<br /><br />Your call.",2
"Perhaps I got an old batch, but I found the popcorn to be a bit stale when it popped up. In terms of ease of use, nothing could be simpler. Add the oil, turn the kettle on and when it's smoking add the popcorn and seasoning (and if you're me, when it's done popping put it in a bowl, drizzle with real butter and microplaned parmigianno reggiano- OMG SOOO good). No one else has complained about it tasting stale in my house so I might just be too picky. I'm not sure if we'll buy this brand again, but in the mean time it is working fine for us.",3
I like a bold coffee that isn't bitter and this one meets my requirements.  I keep trying other blends but am never disappointed when I come back to Italian Roast!,4
"My puppy loves it, and I love my puppy.  She doesn't eat a whole lot just yet, but she will soon.  Looks like it costs about $50-$60 for a month's supply.  Considering that I spend that much on myself in a week, I'll gladly spend that much on my sweet Layla for a month.  The better you spend on dog food, the less you'll spend in the veterinarian's office.  And that's exactly what I told my vet when I took her in for her rounds of shots, and she agreed wholeheartedly.  She only wants my money for routine office visits.  I firmly believe that Wellness dog foods will help ensure that you only take your beloved pet to the vet for routine maintenance.",5
"These are delicious soups (healthy, though typically high in sodium, but be aware that the great price on these (as compared to buying the supermarket) is largely due to the size -- these are HALF THE SIZE (16 ounces) of the typical Imagine soup product one sees in stores (presumably 32 ounces). I bought expecting 12 of the normal sized boxes, and so was disappointed. As long as you know what you're getting (one box is good more or less one generous serving), you can enjoy.",1
"I have been giving this bisquit to my dog. Tired of buying the bag frequently, I searched for a better deal online for 20 lb box. I got the box cheaper than buying equivalent amount of bags even after adding shipping cost. My dog loves this bisquits. Only problem, though it is minor. was that there are more broken pieces than good conditioned bag product. It is understandable but I hope there are less of that.",4
It is nice to have something a bit different than the bottled grocery store catsup.  This goes well on burgers and hot dogs.,4
Both of my dogs love these treats and go crazy over them.  I feel good that I'm giving them something that is healthy too  .,5
"I didn't really care for this tea that much. I've been trying out teas to find which ones I like, I've tried about 30 so far. I like Celestial seasoning's Mandarin Orchard green tea and Salada green tea better than this. I find most Stash brands to be astringent tasting, leaving my mouth feeling dry. If I really watch how hot the water is and steep for only a short time, then the taste is bearable but very weak. My husband also doesn't like any of the stash teas that we've tried.",2
"We really like this cereal. My whole family eats it almost every morning, even my preschooler. I mix it equal parts with rolled oats, and add dried/fresh fruit and nuts. It is bland by itself but great with the fruit. I also replace a portion of the flour with it in many baking recipes like banana bread and similar items and you cant tell the difference. Very good.",4
I totally love POPCHIPS - but the Sea Salt and Vinegar just has too much Vinegar taste for me.  I felt like I was eating just vinegar.  I took the rest to work and some people like the flavor and some said just to much vinegar for them.,2
"WE were a bit underwhelmed. The noodles were typical of macaroni-type food, but the seasoning and the cheese was a bit strong.",3
I wish they would use xylitol or stevia instead of sugar to make this healthier.<br />It's very delicious and probably healthier than soda though. I would recommend this for an occasional sweet treat. Addictive.,4
I have heard some negative things about raw hides for dogs and associated stomach problems if they eat too much.  My miniature schnauzer never really took a liking to chewing on things for a long time so these are a good size and make me feel better that they limit how much she can eat.  It just worries me a little bit how fast she eats them.,3
"This is a must treat for cats who love seafood (most do). Besides being tasty, its crunch can also help with teeth cleaning. My only concern is the price. At times, I paid no more that $12 for a ten pack. Now, the price is over $15. Its fluctuated like this since I've been purchasing them.",5
Great almond paste at a good price.  It's tough to find anything other than the tubed variety in grocery stores.  Even my local Italian deli did not carry the canned paste.  This paste works perfectly in my pignoli nut cookie recipe.,5
"Like Jonathan, I think this coffee is good but not to my liking as an espresso.  It lacks that ""winey"" zing.  Milder, with almost a chocolate taste.  BUT, mixed with SB's espresso - the qualities of the two make a great espresso.  Also, added half and half with regular coffee (Like Folgers) makes morning coffee come alive.",4
"Great product,... wholesome ingredients that blend very well.<br />Try adding some of your favorite nuts (pre heated )<br />Almonds, walnuts or pine.<br />Enjoy",5

"Chips Ahoy chewy cookies- yum!  Or so I thought.  I felt the cookies were meh.  Just ok.  Nothing to sing home about, not super fudgey, just mediocre.  They were just something I ate mindlessly and really could care less about<br /><br />I think the biggest pitfall for me to ding this product was the packaging, there's a pull top so you can open the cookies from the top (think of baby wipes, not the push lid but the refills where you pull off the top to open them and it's sticky) instead of having to open at the end and slide the cookie tray out.  Good idea, right?<br /><br />Idea and effort get an A.  The execution, not so much.  It would have been awesome had the package been resealable (mine was not, maybe faulty packaging? Who knows).  Other than that, good idea.  The cookies were just ok.  Not sure I would buy them in the store, that's just me though...",2

"I like a large variety of herbal teas but not this one. Here, the flavor of  Omega 3 strongly overwhelms the tastes of pomegranate and blubbery. Probably, this tea is good for you but it has a distinct ""fishy"" taste.",2
"These are pretty good size pieces and are very hard and do not become soft like a lot of similar items.  They taste decent have a mild banana flavor.  This product requires your child to have some molars to be able to chew these up, my 18 month old has some trouble with them and prefers other things much more.",2
"Yes, the wasabi coating can be uneven to the point where one bite isn't hot and the next one is so hot that it makes my eyes and nose water but I think this variation makes these babies a bit more fun to eat. This is a tasty, satisfying, high protein, low carb, low glycemic index, and low fat snack food that I can indulge in and still lose weight. How cool is that?",5
"Eh, OK rice. Flavor was a bit mild for me. Prefer Lundberg. Very fresh rice, though! If you prefer the taste of white rice over brown, you may like this rice.<br /><br />I only make my rice on stovetop, using stainless steel cookware on an electric stove. If you use that method of rice cooking and use the suggested amount of water on the jar, it will turn out mushy. Using 1 c rice and 1 1/2 c water works much better.",3

Sorry but this product tasted just awful.  I bought a few different flavors and did not like any of them (and I am a diet drink lover!)  It was very artificial tasting and left a strange after taste.,1
"I read the reviews. I read the ingredients list. I thought I hit it all.....Tried it at last and got ripped off by<br />1.) Price is double that of other websites; amazon for shame on you!<br />2.) Sucralose - discovered when experiments with chlorine compounds to produce new pesticides was tasted by a human. Ummm...it wasn't on the list of ingredients! I tried it once and noticed it right away, picked up the box and there it is, sucralose. I threw this away, the bitter taste AND aftertaste isnt worth it. I don't care how much brown sugar they say they added, you cant put both together and expect a postive result.<br />Dont buy this unless you want a bitter taste and the sure to be in your near future-health problems with cancerous after effects of chlorinated fake sugar.....",1

"We had one of these cubes for 3 years for our English Springer Spaniel. He loved it. One day he got his canine tooth stuck in the round insert. He immediately began howling in pain.  He was howling so loudly while my husband and I safely detached it. I have never heard my dog cry this way before, or since then. We immediately threw away the cube.  By the way, the cube was not damaged when it caught his canine tooth.  It was a freak occurrence, but one we would never chance again.  We were lucky.",1
"I don't know if it's just me, but too many varieties of Cadbury chocolate are just too sweet! The Cadbury eggs and dairy milk bars are the best, but still quite sweet. The curly wurly bars are just not good enough to be worth the price, if you like really sweet chocolate, then get them, but if you're not a fan of really sweet chocolate then I advise against buying these.",3
I recently started eating healthier and needed a low calorie chip to eat with lunches at work. I usually love anything ranch flavored and was excited to try the new Southwest Ranch cracker chips. Their flavor was actually TERRIBLE! I literally thought they tasted like poo. I could only force myself to eat two or three chips. I then had my friend taste them (hoping I could give away the box) and he hated them too. Now I have almost a whole box of these  that I will be throwing away. The texture wasn't very appealing either so I'm not sure if I will ever try another flavor.,1

"We have been big fans of these Altoids for a long time. They are a great breath freshener and cough suppressant. It makes a suitable replacement for preserved ginger candy. However, the old Altoids made in England were much better than the new ones made in the US. The English version was not as sweet and tasted more like real ginger. We still have some of the old version and the differences are very evident. Still, the new ones are the best mass produced mints out there in the market - and the only place we could find to buy them is through Amazon. They are not on retail racks.",3
"...lousy packaging/storage.  While the food itself is wonderful and the cat loves it, Amazon really made a mess of my order.  When the cans were opened, the contents had separated into solid and liquid.  We tried to mix it together again, but the cat refused it.  I email the company and sent a picture along and they said it had been subjected to extreme heat and had cooked in the can.  It wasn't hot locally, so I believe it happened while in Amazon's hands.  Additionally, Amazon has been less then helpful in processing the return.<br /><br />So, buy the food for your cat if it likes it, but just not from Amazon.  Get it from a company that handles food products regularly; they probably know a lot more about keeping products edible.",1

"I have tried both the Green Mountain Hot Cocoa k-cups and the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa and the biggest difference I find is that the Cafe Escapes brand tastes like it has an artificial flavor, perhaps it's the sweetener. The flavor is not as rich or creamy and it is much sweeter than the Green Mountain brand. I would recommend the Green Mountain brand if you are having trouble deciding between the two.",2

"My dog loves this treat and it's great for training and teaching tricks.  I would not recommend them if you have a small dog prone to dental decay.  After going through many bags of these treats I learned that small dogs prone to dental problems should not have soft or sticky treats because they may promote dental problems. I did not know this and he recently had to have 7 teeth pulled.  I don't think it was entirely the fault of this particular treat but a combination of problems, but I think it could have been a factor. Overall, these are great for training.",3

We thought he was going to die, these symptoms all happened over a few days time.<br />We took him to the vet, they ran tons of tests found nothing wrong and gave him a hydration IV and sent him home with instructions for a diet of puree chicken and rice. Days later we gave him a little bit of the dry cat food with his special food. Hours later he was terribly sick again. It was then that we realized the food made him this deathly ill!<br />DO NOT BUY GOODLIFE it almost killed our cat!",1

"I can't even describe the flavor of this creamer...it's definitely not chocolate or mocha.  It's terrible.  Like others have said, I thought maybe it was expired or may it was just one in the box that was bad.  I tried tasting some of the creamer alone (without coffee) and it was just as bad.  Hopefully the other flavors are better...kind of an expensive way to have to find out by buying a whole box and then not liking it.

The grain has a pleasant texture with some crunchiness left in the soybeans and it's not drowned in sauce.<br /><br />The pilaf is vegan and kosher and contains no MSG or preservatives.  The label also claims that it is gluten free but it contains cracked wheat so I am suspicious of that claim.<br /><br />The pilaf is packaged in a shelf-stable, microwavable, stand-up pouch.

"The Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink additive has a fairly good flavor. It doesn't have a bitter aftertaste like some of the other energy additives. However, it gets 3 stars because I really didn't notice an increase in energy at all. It does have a fairly high caffeine content so I assume that is where the energy is supposed to come from. For those that are sensitive to caffeine this will probably give you an energy boost but not the equivalent of an actual energy drink.  I think if you are looking for a low calorie vitamin additive this is a good choice for you. If you are looking for an energy boost you might want to try something else.",3
"Organic, fruity, affordable and not too sweet. What's not to like? To the reviewer who say these lack flavor, I can only imagine she's got a bad batch. Love 'em so much that I'm having these delivered to me regularly. Between me and my 2yo, this bag will probably last us a year. :D",5
"Below is the original review, which was a stellar 5 star. However, after I ran through my first 6 pack and all the jars were great, I ordered another 6pack. So far the first 3 jars have tasted awful. Flavor is awful, bitter, no garlic taste, it's like the peppers were rotten or something. Just really not edible. I can no longer recommend this. I would steer away from it due to the inconsistancy. Guess I'm gonna have to ordering more expensive Italian brands or go to Italy afterall.<br /><br />--------------------Old Review-----------------------------------------<br />This is exactly the same as the stuff I remember having in Italy, which figures because it is from Italy. It may be a tad on the expensive side but it is worth every penny. I purchase by the 6-pack which lasts me a few months. I love the flavor. The peppers will give any sauce the signature Italian heat that you can't get with Asian or Mexican peppers. It's hot but not too hot, and it's full of flavor.<br /><br />I use it in my pasta sauces or just as a bruscetta. It goes great with a little marinara and shrimp. I also once fried up some pine nuts in a pan with olive oil and then added this to it, and bam! great spicy pasta dish. I bet it goes great with pesto to make a spicy pesto... hmmm I'm gonna have to try that next.",1
"Our cats eat the Chicken and rice dry food from this fabulous line and one of them has allergies and a very sensitive stomach, but this is the only food she will tolerate besides human baby food (chicken), but for some reason they wont even touch this.

Glad we have the dry version and would suggest trying this line to anyone for a healthier cat.",3
"I love Vita Coco and I like Rihanna but this flavor is just terrible. I like all of the other Vita Coco flavors except this one. When I first tasted it, I immediately checked the expiration date to make sure it did not go bad. Then I tried a few more hoping I will eventually like it and convince myself that Vita Coco can't possibly be this bad. But in the end I came across a bottle that just had a very foul taste so I decided to throw all of the remaining drinks away.",1

"My wife originally ate one a few weeks ago and told me about how the next day she had sharp stomach pains and spent quite a bit of time in the bathroom.  I didn't think much of it and I ended up buying one for myself (admittedly by mistake, I just wanted a regular beef stick).  They taste okay; the spiciness is interesting that it has sort of a delay but, it does seem to stick around long after the burn starts.<br /><br />However, the next day I woke up out of a deep sleep from sharp pains in my stomach and had to use the bathroom twice.  And the pains are very sharp, I had to keep clenching my stomach and I was rocking back and forth.  I feel bad that my wife had to experience this during work!<br /><br />tl;dr: Tastes okay, but the 'end result' is not worth it... unless you've been constipated for weeks and have grown desperate for a cure, you'll probably not want to experience the end results of this delicious beef stick.",1
"My dog had been taking pills without issue for several months.  Due to a recent surgery, her daily pill count has gone up dramatically, and it has become increasingly difficult to get her to take them. I have heard many people saying how wonderfully these pill pockets work, so I finally decided to give them a try.  First, I think they are ridiculously expensive (although reasonable at Amazon, these cost almost 30% more at my local pet store, where I unfortunately bought them).  Second, if the pills taste bad (particularly if they are tablets that are cut in half to lower the dosage), it is likely that your dogs will still spit them out if they are anything like mine.

"I have two cats and have always been feeding them this food,one is 5 and the other 9 years old and they are both 15 pounds.So they are fat and I could never figure out why,since they only got to share on cup between each other all day.So about two weeks ago I did some research on this food and my eyes were opened.I feel horrible that I fed them this junk food and I thought I was giving them the Best out there,since my Vet gave it to me and said it was great for them.<br />So anyways my male cat is now on Wellness Indoor dry and expensive wet food like Blue Buffalo,Wellness and Merrick.He loves it and I had no problem switching him over and I already notice the difference in his energy level.But my biggest issue is my female cat,she will not touch any other food than her Science junk food.I tried mixing it with the new food,starting at 75% old to 25% new,nothing she wouldn't touch it.So I tried 90% to 10%,still nothing.She cried and wined and didn't eat one morsel in four days and was just laying in one spot all day having even less energy than before.So I called my new Vet and she said now it is getting dangerous because she wouldn't eat at all.I had to give her her old junk food back,because I did not want her to die.I have no idea what to do,she is so addicted to this food and I can't get her of it.She hates wet food with a passion.I am worried about Diabetes if she will get any bigger.So I am really sad that nothing seems to work with her.<br />I made her a junk food addict,it's my fault.I wish I never started her on this food at all.",1
"I found Brooks Rich & Tangy Ketchup and immediately bought it.  I love ketchup.  I put ketchup on my ketchup, but I wouldn't ever buy this again.  I'll stick to Heinz.",1
"By initial appearances, this looks like it could be very good.  Sweetened by honey - good, natural - good, but then take a look at the actual ingredients.  Not much natural about this.  Sure honey is one of the ingredients, but so is sucralose.  I know plenty of people are fine with this or use it as a substitute for sugar for dietary reasons, but I can't stand the stuff.  The mix of different tastes (tea, pomegranate, sucralose) is very unpleasant to me.  Of course tastes vary between any two people and you may enjoy this, but be aware that it does contain artificial sweeteners if that is not what you are looking for.  I have also tried the Mango version and although it also contains sucralose, it is a bit more tolerable.",1
"When I bought this, I thought it was for 2 packs of 24, which is usually what I get for $22.00.  However, when I got my order it was only 1 pack, so I returned it. I found the exact K-Cups for $12 for 24 at at different web site. This was a rip off.",2
"I did not read the k-count carefully and was extremely disappointed to realize that I paid over $1 each per k-cup for these teas.

I was expecting more quantity and something that looks store bought. I am very disappointed for the price.",2

"I recently dropped coffee for tea. I bought some Moroccan mint to compliment my Stash double bergamot. The Moroccan mint wasn't exactly what I thought it would be. It tastes almost exactly like spearmint. It isn't very strong either. I guess I like super strong teas (being a black coffee drinker). Either way, it is a great tea. Definitely recommend it.",4

"The Honey Grahams are excellent.  Not sweet like white-flour grahams, but filling and satisfying since made with whole wheat flour.  I make 3 peanut butter + graham cracker cookies per day (with other goodies) and they are very satisfying.<br />My problem is the packaging.  I'm just finishing a pack of 12 16-ounce boxes and there was not 1 box with unbroken crackers.  Box after box after box after box of broken crackers.<br />Mi-Del needs to package them in larger boxes and to cushion them with shipping materials such as  bubble wrap-- <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GHJM9C"">3/16"" x 175ft x 12"" BUBBLE WRAP ROLL * SMALL BUBBLES</a> or packing peanuts--<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CCSLQO"">2 Bags Green Loose Fill Shipping Packing Peanuts</a><br />Mi-Del should also have the word ""FRAGILE"" printed on the cartons so they are not tossed or handled roughly by shipping & receiving.<br />These are great graham crackers with no sugar and with no white flour.

"Very pleased with this. Good lavender flavor, good scent. The taste is strong, clean, and sharp.<br /><br />The website of the manufacturer appears to reflect a company preoccupied with product quality and health.<br /><br />This doesn't appear to be the most economical lavender flavor available, but when you factor in the size of the bottle--4 oz., twice the size of most--it has a very competitive price.<br /><br />I find this roughly on par with the Herb Pharm lavender <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001TL6FS"">Lavender Extract 1 Ounces</a>, but only 1/4 the price,<br />and greatly superior to the chemical-tasting Star Kay White <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L1XMAA"">Pure Lavender Extract 2 oz.</a>",5
Will not order again and may not finish the ones I have here. These are not bad but just not very good either. I compare these to Bugles chips in taste. Do yourself a favor and buy 1 bag locally 1st before buying a case online and then not wanting to finish the bag let alone the whole case.,3

"We have tried several brands of so-labeled Chocolate Raspberry Coffee, and this was the worst so far. It has no flavor or aroma of chocolate or raspberry, and has an odd chemical taste as well. Other brands weren't great but at least were tolerable as plain coffee. This one is not.",1
"I don't normally buy stuff like this, but my husband was in an odd mood and wanted to try one at a gas station. I don't really trust beverages like this that go so far into selling the supplement side of the beverage that they don't even mention flavors. I'm not against adding nutrients to drinks, but the benefits are limited and I view it as a beverage first and foremost. Anyway, Hubby wanted to try one. After he tried a sip he passed it on to me. I smelled it and said it smelled familiar but I couldn't place it, some kind of vitamin or medicine maybe. He just smiled and told me to drink it. I took a sip, and it tasted very much like it smelled. Then he filled me in on why it was familiar, it tastes exactly like Flinstones chewable vitamins, It even has a kind of chalky texture. In the end it wasn't disgusting, but it wasn't great either. If you really want a drinkable supplement and miss the taste of those chewy little vitamins, go ahead and try one.",3
"As I am looking to shed a few of those winter pounds, I wanted to try Snackwell's Caramel Popcorn. It is simply ok as most diet foods are.

"The coffee is fine, and the price is a bargain, BUT...when the box was delivered, there was loose coffee coming out of the bottom of the box.  Some of the K-cups were open and had to be thrown away and were not useable.  It looks like the K-cups are just thrown into the carton and some were torn open in the process.  The box was undamaged so the damage was not incurred during shipping.  If it occurs again, I'm going to cancel the subscription.",4
"If your dog chews these up into tiny pieces, they're probably good treats for him/her.  Our Golden Retriever chews them down to two inch or larger pieces that she tries to swallow.  They get caught in her throat choking her and we have to get our fingers down her throat past the piece to pull it out, very abusive for the dog.  If we don't catch the problem when she first starts to choke, it could be fatal.<br /><br />We've stopped giving her these treats.",1

"i've been enjoying the ""just Tomatoes"" brand of dehydrated fruits for a while and decided to branch out.

"In two words...awful and artificial.  I didn't find any place I could find out what the ingredients were in this until after I got it and it tasted so weird.  I know, I should have checked it out first, but I didn't even suspect artificial ingredients would be a concern.  Anyway, it is non returnable but Amazon did refund my money for this because to us, it is not fit for consumption.",1

"Generally, these Quaker oatmeal cookies were a disappointment.  The major positive is that the first ingredient listed is whole grain oat flour.  Other pluses are that the cookie is not particularly sweet, individually wrapped, and it is soft, but not crumbly.  My husband and I tried these cookies for dessert last night.  The first issue was that they are 170 calories each, meaning we only had one, even though their size is not particularly large, around 3 inches in diameter.  Second, the overall taste and texture impression of the cookie is that it is commercially made; it will not remotely remind you of homemade.  Third, and personally, there are not enough raisins.  Finally, both of us noticed the cinnamon flavoring, which was border line too much; the ingredients list indicates allspice as well.  The only ""fortifications"" to the cookie are calcium (4%) and iron (8%).",3
"On a trip to Paris we visited the Maille store.  They have hundreds (or more?) of different flavors of Dijon mustard.  We selected a few in the smaller bottles and 2 or 3 ""poivre vert"" in the normal size.  All were wonderful but we quickly realized just how lucky it was that we brought home so many of the poivre vert - Dijon with green peppercorn.<br /><br />It's difficult to explain why - except as a base for my families favorite salad dressing, I'm not a big fan of plain Dijon mustard - but this combo makes an amazing mustard.<br /><br />At first we used it on turkey burgers.  We rarely eat beef and until we found this mustard, felt as though we were sacrificing every time we had a turkey burger.  Now it is one of our most favorite foods.  Combined with a slice of red onion, the green peppercorn mustard just makes the burger something unbelievably tasty!<br /><br />We could not find any way to buy the Maille Poivre Vert mustard here in the States so when our Son and Daughter-in-law travelled to Paris we asked (begged) them to find the store and bring some home, which they did and we savored every drop.<br /><br />This past Summer they visited France again only this time they brought back a bottle of Edmond Fallot 'moutarde au poivre vert' along with some of the Maille.<br /><br />They told us they picked this up in the Dijon region of France (or town?) and fully expected we would like it better.<br /><br />It is at least as wonderful as the Maille.  We may not have a palate sophisticated enough to discern a difference between the two but THIS one is available (placing my first order today via Amazon) here in the US.<br /><br />I am sure EVERYONE who enjoys a sandwich or a burger will love what this mustard adds to the flavor.  It's even great added to cheese and crackers!",5
"I pre-ordeded this product before its release, so I had no reviews to warn me that it was sugar-free, nor was there any mention in the product name. The aspartame ruins what would be a decent tasting cider. I don't like artifical sweeteners, but it would have still been good if the sweetener was Splenda or Stevia. That aspartame takes over the taste!",2
I have hot cereal every morning. I mix muesli and oat bran together and cook it in unsweetened almond milk. You can add fruit and nuts if you like. Use some sweetener other than white sugar. The Red Mill Muesli gives it a great taste and texture. It's hard to find this muesli anywhere. I'm glad it's sold on Amazon. By the way you get more than enough fiber if you make it like I do.,5

"Over the past year or so I have come to appreciate the depth of flavor in many dried and dehydrated vegetables.  They are great in anything that requires a long cooking time.  I was, however, disappointed in these peppers.  They are quite bitter and the container has many seeds in it.  If you are looking for the flavor of sweet bell peppers, it is not to be found here.",3

"I've been ordering a lot of these. Many of these go directly to my daughter's house. This is to let people know that most of the cans in these packages are DENTED. In the beginning I had thought it was an occasional can or two but I see in the last shipment that all of the cans were dented. It was just a matter of degree. However, when I purchased these at the retail store, none were dented. I think this is a good enough reason for me to think twice about buying these via Amazon in the future. I don't believe the price difference is all that much. I would hate for my cats to get botulism from the poor quality of the cans.",2
"Wow, I have to say, I did not enjoy this drink additive at all.  I've tried several other brands, some I liked some I didn't, but this was my first opportunity to enjoy a MIO, and it didn't speak well for the brand.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this product would probably be the taste.  It's supposed to be mango peach and honestly it didn't taste like either of those things.  The suggested serving is 1 squeeze per 8oz serving so I tried that at first in my water bottle.  It tasted like extremely watered down indeterminate flavored gatorade.  Not so good.  So the next time I amped it up and did 3-4 squeezes into my water bottle.  This time the flavor was stronger but it still didn't taste a thing like mango or peach and actually I felt like I was drinking that sugar water they place in hummingbird feeders.  The color was about the same too come to think of it.  It was kind of disappointing not only for the taste, but for the fact that I needed to use 3x the amount suggested to actually taste anything.  This means there probably won't be the 24 servings it says it has.  Not that I'll probably finish it.<br /><br />The only thing this had going for it was that the ingredients were somewhat natural.  But then they through a bunch of red and yellow dyes to bring that down.  It also has an attractive bottle that it comes in, easy to tote around.  But that only goes so far.  This product is supposed to flavor water and since it fails in that area I can't really recommend it.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011",2

I got the box of 1-oz packs and it's pretty consistent among the packs.",2

First off the pepper flavoring is nice not too much. Just the right amount of spice.The saltiness was a turn off for me. I thought there was too much salty flavor to them. However they are good in like a salad or something. To eat on their own not so good. They do have the nice pepper flavor just  overall I thought they were a tad bit to salty for my liking . I have had other flavors of this brand I got before at a Local Grocery.This flavor here is gonna be like the crystal pepsi probably short lived. Not very good at all. Tone down on the salt and they'll be fine.,3

Pretty impressive for Lipton for their fruit infusion which is amazing! I found this to work better when you insert these packages in the 16.9 ounce bottles and THEN refrigerate them as they dissolve easier this way. In addition; I had even used the remainder in my small CamelBak® while I went on a 60 mile cycling tour on March 31st on my Trek® (Racing / Touring Cycle) to keep hydrated. I adore Mangoes and Pineapples; but come across mixing this with tea - that I have never heard of(I own a Mango tree and grow Pineapples)!<br /><br />It's great for anyone who is a FRUIT FUSION lover or a smoothie lover or those who dare to venture into something different!,4

"I am using this shampoo with Clair Strong Lengths conditioner.  It is mild shampoo and only a dash is needed for your hair, no matter what the hair length.  It has many nourishing oils in it and makes hair feel clean and silky.  In addition to oils, this shampoo also has multiple bio-nutrients; combination of minerals and vitamins will make your hair stronger and shiny.<br /><br />Shampoo does not have strong fragrance; it is just right.  It also keeps frizz out of the way, very helpful feature for humid climate customers.  Sturdy base of the product makes it stable to use and lay out in the shower.  You will never make a mistake which bottle is shampoo and which one is conditioner.  Shampoo label is upside down while conditioner can be read normally.  Shampoo has light see true color, while conditioner has thick white color - another distinction if you are not paying attention to the lables and you just start queezing the product out of the bottle.<br /><br />I personally enjoy the product very much and recommend it to others.  It is a kind of product that can be used by the entire family.",4

"I love BFF by Weruva because it's incredibly healthy, with only quality meats and supplements and no grains or by-products, but is so much cheaper than any other ""premium"" brand of comparable quality out there.  I don't even know how they manage to keep the price so reasonable.  The difference in quality is obvious when you open the can, as the food hasn't been ground into unrecognizable oblivion but still has identifiably shredded meat and looks a healthy flesh color, not some unsatisfying 'blah' brown.  I'm a student, so I'm on a very tight budget, but it's worth it to me to purchase BFF for my cats because I believe in preventative care.  Feed my cats well from the beginning and they'll live long, healthy, happy lives with less health problems that will leave me with expensive vet bills.  As for now, my cats and kitten gobble it up in a second flat.  It's obvious they love every flavor I've tried with them (and one is even quite picky).  Their fur is like silk, too.  This is clearly a great food.",5
"I rarely write a review unless a product is outstandingly good or bad... in this case I can say this is the worst food product I have ever purchased.<br /><br />Long story short, it's a box of salt, salt, and salt with some garlic powder.

"Lately I have found that good customer service is a trait lacking by most companies that I do business with. I had thought it would be no different when I didn't really enjoy the pumpkin spice syrup that I purchased from Amoretti. I am glad to say that I could not have been more wrong. I posted a comment earlier about how I didn't enjoy this syrup at all (although for some reason I cannot locate it on the feed now) I felt it was over spiced and cloying. Within an hour of my post I received a phone call from customer service offering to replace my bottle that I didn't enjoy with something that I might. In addition to a  replacement, the person I spoke with also stated that they would be sending out different samples of their products so that I might try them to see the quality of what they sell without having a repeat of the pumpkin spice. My 3 star ranking comes from not enjoying this specific product. In customer service this company gets a FIVE STARS.",3
"The first ingredient is corn.  Not that that's unusual for dog food.  I'm a Purina Pro Plan fan myself.  I gave the Beneful food a try with my dog and didn't care at all for the moist (food dyed) pieces.  Its obviously made, packaged and marketed to attract humans -- certainly not dogs!  Few dogs, if turned loose to fend for themselves, would head for the vegetable garden.  It's not cheap, so spend your money on a meat based food.",2
"Hi, I order cases of canned crushed tomato all the time because it's much easier to receive by mail on the doorstep than carrying from market.<br /><br />Cento tomatoes are good along with Muer Glen tomato, this is about damaged dented cans received each time.<br /><br />I typically order Muer Glen organic canned tomato and now trying Cento.  Each time several cans arrive dented.  Amazon is good about replacing since food items cannot be returned but they need to do something about the shipping to prevent the cans becoming dented.<br /><br />Last week a case of Cento cans arrived with 9 badly dented cans out of 12.  I am sure Amazon will replace or credit but they need to do something about shipment, perhaps label Fragile and put more padding.<br /><br />A couple of times with Muer Glen there were several cans with smaller dents and I just kept them rather than keep contacting Amazon.<br /><br />Again Amazon is very good about rectifying but I'm not sure what can be done to prevent the dented cans during shipment, it's not convenient to have to keep sending emails about the issue each time.  Maybe they should check the cans prior to shipment in case they are receiving them dented, not sure.",3
This tea isn't too bad ... it tastes a little bit like hay.  The stuff I've gotten in the local Espresso Royale puts this tea to shame.  This could be a more traditional/real deal tea but I wouldn't know.  It just tastes a little bit off.,2
I usually hit a wall right around 2:00 in the afternoon at work. I start yawning and my eyes get heavy. I tried 5hr energy to get passed that feeling but it didn't really help.

It is a bit small, however, and I worry about my small dog (miniature schnauzer) choking on it -- which may be more of a concern for larger dogs.",3
The coffee pods from Senseo are to weak if you make a full cup of coffee. Luckily I have bought the the Senseo Supreme coffee maker which allows me to adjust the amount of water for each cup.<br />If you make 2/3 cup of coffee the taste is really good and nothing to complain about. If the pod are too weak for you than get Senseo supreme coffee maker.,3
"I like honey, preferably in small doses, and Ambrosoli Honees' Energy Plus Vitamin Honey Drops fits the bill.  After allowing one of these drops to dissolve in my mouth for just a few minutes, I was given a small punch of pure honey from the center of the drop.  The taste was very good and just sweet enough to satisfy.  Being real honey, just know that if any of the outer candy coating is still in your mouth, the honey will adhere it to whatever tooth happens to be closest!<br /><br />These drops claim to give you a bit of energy as well, but I found myself wanting in the ""energy"" department.  Each drop contains about a third of the daily recommended amounts of Vitamins C, B6, and B12, which means you would have to consume three of these drops in order to get the full ""energy"" effect.  With only nine pieces per pack, though, you're really only getting three ""energy"" servings as compared to the nine servings listed on the package.<br /><br />If you enjoy the taste of honey and like a little touch of it every now and then, these Amrosoli Honees Energy Plus drops are perfect.  If you want a boost of energy, however, you might want to chase your honey drops with a Monster, Red Bull, or Rockstar.<br /><br />Recommended only for taste.",3
"""Grilled Sirloin"" sounds great for a dog food, and my dog was sniffing the package and followed me from the door to the kitchen with intense interest. He was more interested in this food than many types of treats he has had. So, if your dog is a picky eater who would lose weight rather than eat a food that doesn't interest it (I have had a dog like this), then this might be a viable choice for you in order for you to get your dog to eat.<br /><br />On the flip side, if your dog has no problems at mealtimes and you want to provide him/her a healthy meal at a fair price, you may want to keep looking. My dog eats 4 cups of his regular food, maintains his weight and energy and has good stools. With this food, he needs about seven cups and a couple more trips outside each day. More food and more waste, because less food/volume is being absorbed by the dog. Less nutrition and more fillers. Pet food manufacturers often split up a filler food into separate types (soy meal/soy flour) so that a meat type will move to first in line of ingredients. First up is ""Beef"" although not specified as grilled sirloin or not, it is still generally better than foods that start with four types of corn product or a meat byproduct. This also has poultry byproduct meal, plus 3 soy ingredients, 2 wheats, brewers rice, corn, barley,  and 4+ artificial colorings. While it is not the worst dog food on the market, it is certainly not the best, and certainly not at this price point. Your dog will probably love this stuff -kind of like how people love junk food.",3
"I think we've all experienced those gum balls that lose their flavor after about 10 seconds, then turn so hard that your jaw starts to get tired.  These are a step above that.  First of all, they are the smaller gum balls, which I didn't expect.  Second, they lose their flavor pretty quickly.  I would eat one, then pop another one in a few seconds later to try to elongate my chewing experience but after about 30 seconds, I had to spit it out.  They're not bad tasting, but I probably wouldn't order them again.",2
"I love this tea. I am disgusted by the appalling mark-up this seller has put on it. A one pound bag of this very same Mighty Leaf Organic Earl Grey, loose leaf, is available directly on their Mighty Leaf website for $24. I love shopping through Amazon; it is simple, and I (generally) feel secure that I'm getting competitive pricing from an array of reputable dealers. I often don't bother comparing to outside sources... in this case I'm glad I did!",1
I thought that these bars were very tasty if a bit on the expensive side.  My main complaint is that the bars disintegrate as you open up the packaging. Since the bars are also very sticky remain stuck to the rapper as they break apart so you are stuck having to pick off pieces of the bar from the inside of the wrapper (which is difficult because the wrapper is plastic not foil). I don't know if I got an old box of these or if they're all like this. Regardless I probably won't risk getting another box like the first.,2
I have ordered several loose leaf green teas online and so far this is the best quality.,4
"This stuff is so hot it's unpleasant, but for some reason, I still use it on some of my foods, mostly Mexican dishes.  Is it for the algedonic experience that I keep using it and not throwing it away.  It overpowers anything you're eating, so really you're eating the meal to tame the burn a little.  It does have a burnt/smokey flavor that other reviewers have noted.  I will stick with Melinda's XXXXtra Hot Reserve Habanero Hot Sauce for most of my hot sauce needs.",2
Only two or three seed actually grew.<br />I did follow all the instruction.<br />This is very disappointing!<br />I don't recommend this at all!,1
I love these Happy Baby/Tot foods for a couple reasons. 1) the diversity of foods they offer (Spinach/mango/pear - where else will you find that?) 2) the convenience of the pouch and 3) My baby gulps these down - he loves them. Only drawback is that at this time the pouch is not recyclable. Oh and they can be a bit pricey.,4
"I love coffee and especially grinding my own beans. I use a fairly fancy Krups that makes excellent coffee. I have some favorites and few are flavored.  I do like the occasional hazelnut or vanilla flavors.  I was hoping to have a hint of the flavor, not an overwhelming one.  I was not disappointed.  The smell of vanilla was a lot stronger than the actual taste.<br /><br />The coffee was good, not great or otherwise outstanding, but good.  I'd call this an easy drinking coffee and I feel I could serve it without mentioning that it was vanilla flavored.  All in all, it's a good coffee with a *hint* of vanilla.",3
The temperatures were to extreme highs outside and yet they were able to deliver it only partially warm and unmelted. I left them in the fridge while I was upstairs just for a crisper taste. I came downstairs a while later.. Let me just say.. OMNOMONOMnomnomnomnom good!.. They are heavenly with herbal tea. :),4
"It does give popcorn and even mashed potatoes a cheesy taste, it cannot compare with some of Wabash's other toppings. Nice for a change sometimes though.",3
"Not one person in my household who has tried this, has enjoyed it.  I bought some of this for my dad and i thought he would love this because he likes a really bold cup of coffee but he hated it.  I have to had it to him though... he tried to like it for my sake.  He tried it several times before he was honest and said he truly hated it.  My mother, who likes her coffee on the weak side tried to water it down but she said she almost spit it back out into the sink when she took the first sip (wish i had been there to see it).<br /><br />I tried it knowing it wasn't really my type because my dad honestly didn't like it and that made me curious.  Also i tend to believe with the appropriate amount of milk and sugar any coffee can be decent right?  Well i didn't finish the cup even after the extensive doctoring i did.  It was burnt tasting and very bitter.  I'm very surprised there are so many good reviews for this one.  The only use i could think of for it is if you are on a long drive down the highway at night... it would be good to keep you awake.  Not only will the caffeine help but the terrible taste in your mouth.",1
"I am very satisfied with this purchase. I did not count each flavor, but seem like a very even amount. I noted only one of them was cracked.",5
"It is only .4 oz, bit pricey for how small and unmanageable they are.<br />Thought bottle could be more user friendly.",2
"I was looking for alternative healthy protein snack with less fat than slim  jims. Texas BBQ sounded like an awesome flavor---so I bought them. For those of you who have never tried them....pick up a rubber band, baste it in bbq sauce and then eat. That is what this soy protein jerky taste like...a bbq flavored rubber band. The only way I will ever eat these again is if the world no longer has any other protein choice available.",1
"I was very excited to be able to get the Midsummer's Peach because it's been unavailable from Harney & Sons for a while now.  I drank it so much that I used to buy it in bulk directly from them. When this tea arrived I quickly brewed up a cup and couldn't believe it was the same tea! The flavor was overwhelming, jarring, not subtle. Maybe this is the last stash that has aged poorly. Anyway, if you like Harney & Sons' Midsummer's Peach this won't be your nostalgia tea.",2
"Most pieces were broken upon arrival. I knew, from baking our own gingerbread houses in the past, that broken pieces could be reassembled using icing. But not the icing that comes with this kit! Ultimately, we tried cutting the broken pieces to form a new gingerbread house. Again, the icing failed -- it wasn't strong enough to keep the pieces together.<br /><br />Tasted good, though.",1
"Not much of a lemon flavor for lemon cookies, more on the sweet side.  Coconut is listed in the ingredients, but you certainly won't taste it.  My son liked them, so they won't go to waste.  I would not buy them again.",3
Glad to find this hard to get product.  Quick service and easy to work with company.,5
"I was pretty disappointed when I received these. They just don't seem to taste right, and the texture just seems off. I opened the second bag hoping it would be better, but more of the same. I would NOT order these again.",2
"I bought a new Keurig coffee maker for my wife and was finding those little pods all over the place. The Grandchildren thougth they were building toys! I intended to mount this drawer under cabinet but it's construction is plenty sturdy enough to have the coffee maker sit on top with great stability. Very well built. Put pods in right side up, up side down ect ect you can fit in an extra 6.",4
This coffee was sold back years ago by the A&P stores.<br /><br />It was a good coffee then and remains so today.,5
"Well, my kid who isn't gluten free likes them, and my kid who is won't touch them.  I cook and bake most of what we eat, so desserts are very homemade and natural in their flavor.  These are really, really artificial-lemon flavored....they remind me of my dish soap every time I try one.  I really don't like the flavor, but the texture is nice.  I'm a little dizzied that I have so many boxes of something I don't care for... it was worth a try, though.",2
I had this for the first time a few nights ago.  It was served with olive oil over a avocado and blew cheese salad.  It was fantastic.  Can't wait for Amazon to carry it.,5
"I drink tea daily and was looking to buy in bulk to largely to save money.  I truly love this tea, and I've tried many brands of chai.  I like the flavor, the fact that is organic and the way it is packaged.  I'm thrilled to have found this tea at such a great price with great quality as well.  I've tried several other varieties of Davidson's teas  and think the quality of all of them is great, but the classic chai is my favorite.",5
I can say hands down this is the best coffee for me.  It is slightly coconut flavored and a very mild roast.  When you brew a cup the entire house takes on the island coconut scent.  I wish that they produced this flavor year round and I also wish it came in decaf.,5
"Quaker Oatmeal Squares cereal consists of pillow-shaped dense nuggets of oaty cereal.  There's a light sweetness, more of a brown sugar taste, that comes in the bite.  The nuggets stay pleasantly crunchy in milk, but I found that I enjoyed them most of all as a snack.  The cereal feels like a grown-up version of Life; the differences are that it is less sweet than Life cereal) and has a much heartier texture and flavor.  I do think that fans of Life that are beginning to find it too crumbly or sweet will enjoy this cereal as an alternative for snacking or breakfast.<br /><br />Nutritionally, I like that it has a fairly high amount of protein for a cereal (6g per serving, without milk, vs. only 4g for Life cereal).  Surprisingly, though, it has slightly (1g per cup) more sugar than Life cereal, despite being less sweet generally.  It's also higher in calories at 210 per cup vs. 160 for a cup of Life.  (If you do these comparison's directly on Quaker's website, note that Life has a serving size of 3/4 cup whereas this has a serving size of 1 cup.  So, you have to adjust the nutritional info accordingly.)  Even with this though, I think Oatmeal Squares are more filling in the same amount and possibly more satisfying.  That may be due to the higher fiber content (5g per cup vs. &lt;3g per cup for Life).<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed it and would certainly buy it if the price were right and the mood struck me.",4
"This tea is quite tasty.  I bought it because of the possible weight loss properties touted by Dr. Oz.  While I haven't noticed a significant loss, it's still VERY good tasting tea",4
"exactly what I ordered, shipped immediately, and got here early.  I ordered 4 cases so that my husband could take them out on the submarine with him, and he is one happy man out to sea right now.",5
These are some of the best you can get for fans of non-flavored coffee.<br />Newmans and Caribou are some of the very best and the other two are also very good!<br />Enjoy!,5
"I purchased several containers of these SweeTarts and they were all stale and unpleasant to eat.  And that's only if you could get one out of the wrapper that didn't have white plastic stuck all over it.  It was impossible, even with a good deal of picking, to get all the wrapper bits off of the candy.  I know my Chewy SweeTarts and these were not right.",1
"I am pleased with this vendor, for when I ordered the coffee, it was reported that it would take several days for it to reach me, being that it originates outside of the U.S.  It arrived 3 days sooner than the earliest reported time for arrival!  The coffee was fresh and I enjoyed every last bit of it.  It was very subtle, no bitterness whatsoever, and I would/ will buy it again.  Though I will try other vendors to compare it to.",4
"I carefully read all the reviews on this Item before ordering! I must say, there are not that many real Tea drinkers writing reviews for this particular Item. Sure, if you are a Lipton dipper, this is a great tea. But if you know what a quality tea should offer, you would not have given this product more than 2-Stars.<br />The Aroma when first open the bag, is quiet decent, but when the tea is Brewed, the flavor is a disaster. It is basically a lipton like flavor. The color, is also unlike a good quality Earl-gray! Which it should have an amber color, that can be anywhere from light, to deep end of the spectrum, depending if the tea is a Single Body, or need to be mixed with another tea for potentiation of Color.<br /><br />At last, the tea leaves are not uniformly sized, which basically means this tea is probably a mixture of low quality teas, just flavored as Earl-Gray!<br /><br />Coffee Bean direct should consider offering a better tea, for a few more $$$!!! At least 2Lb of tea would be worth Brewing!",2
These are just great overall treats that my dog loves. Easy to break apart to make them last longer. My cats like them too.,5
"Having tried just about every other vegan jerky item on the market I was excited to find one that is completely gluten-based, offering a very reasonable protein-to-calories ratio (~10%), a reasonable price-per-ounce, plus great reviews to boot.  Got the product and discovered to my great chagrin that it requires refrigeration after opening!!  Not only does that fly in the face of what jerky is supposed to be, it is not disclosed anywhere in the Amazon product description.  Ouch!  So much for taking these 4oz packages on the trail, or anywhere else for that matter.<br /><br />Also, be aware that the product -- unlike several competitive vegan jerky products -- is made in Taiwan which could mean it uses Chinese gluten.  That's a source I personally try to avoid because of significant food safety issues in the past.  However, I contacted the manufacturer and was told that their gluten is ""imported from either Australia, Western Europe or the USA......most all our ingredients are from these sources.  We manufacture in Taiwan because they have ways of cooking with soy and wheat gluten that are not found in the west.""<br /><br />All that said, taste is pretty good and the ""wet"" packaging gives it a softer texture than competitive products (which I personally still prefer).",2
"Order this brand and the JUST TOMATOES brand and this is better. They taste very similar, but this has a little more juice to it; corn syrup and oil. May not be considered healthy by others due to the high fructose corn syrup, but I'd rather have corn syrup over sugar free stuff which alters my body's ability to process sugar. If you want really dry blue berry, go for the just tomatoes brand as there's nothing added, but for a little more juice, this is the one to go for. Both are very, very good.",5
"Having purchased the Soulistic ""Gelee"" and BFF (made by the same company) I wanted to try the ""Gravy"" flavors to add some more variety.  Although the food looks appetizing and all the cats seem to like the food, I was dismayed to see that there seemed to be as much gravy as food in the cans.  I do not want to be paying the same price for cans that contain this much liquid and less food.  I will purchase the Soulistic ""Gelee"" foods and BFF again, but it isn't likely that I will purchase the ""Gravy"" flavors.",2
"There was definitely a lot of candy in the box but about half of them I wouldn't say were 80's candies. No redhots or sugar babies. I thought the description of what would be in the box included those, even though it did say that the selection would vary. I just was expecting more stuff that I remember from the 80's.",3
This is a good toy to keep your dog busy. However a little hard to get the opening loose to put the treats in. But then once you have the treats it keeps her busy (cairn terrier). Just make sure you put the lid/insert back in really good and tighten it. My dog got it loose and pulled it out and then chewed up the insert...which then leaves the ball part with no way to close it. SO just make sure the little plug thing is tight.,3
The order shipped very fast but they were melted when they got to me! 5 pds of melted nothing! Disappointed!,2
This is an outstanding product!! The test is great and lives up to it's ancient name Roman Apples. Altogether  a warm comfortable taste and calming nature.,5
"Bottled this up 6 weeks ago, went to open a bottle today and had to toss the whole batch.  The sediment in the bottle and the taste was nasty.  Not very strong, week taste, instructions were not like other wines.  Very gasey!!! skip this crap, you pay for what you get.  wish I new how to get my money back!!!",1
The caffeine content is 1/3; the organic white tea is not decaffeinated.  This tea tastes great and has great neurological effects on me.  It makes me more alert while feeling soothing to my nerves!  This tea doesn't remind me at all of chamomile in taste or effect.  I will definitely re-order!,5
"I never had this candy bar before. I thought it was gonna be a hunk of caramel but its a caramel flavored chocolate bar.  I didnt really like it, but I read lots of good reviews about it. I should have read the description of what it was before I bought it LOL. Live and learn.",2
"Lundberg Jubilee is a blend of sweet brown rice, short and long grain brown rice and colorful red and black whole grain Wehani and Japonica rice varieties which are also very round and short-grained.  This product looks very pretty in the package and cooks up nicely.<br /><br />However, I bought this rice as a rice to eat with stir fry dishes and, in that capacity, I developed the opinion that this product doesn't have the amazingly appealing scent and texture that the Lundberg long grain rice has on its own.<br /><br />I will try cooking some rice salads with this Jubilee rice blend because, as some of the other reviews have pointed out, that's probably a good way to put this rice to its best use.<br /><br />From using this product, I have learned that for use as a side dish with chicken, stir-fry, etc. I think that long grain rice is a preferable choice.",4
"I am a huge fan of Libby's Easy Pumpkin Pie mix.  One can of that and a can of evaporated mix and you have an instant pumpkin pie pudding or topping, no cooking needed because it is precooked when canned.  Libby's was swept off the shelves due to a harvest shortage this year (2009 harvest).  I bought some cans of this Farmer's Market pumpkin pie mix.  OMG, out of the can it's a very thick paste instead of slightly pourable like Libby's.  OK, that's a good thing, means it's richer.  Or does it.  I dunno.  So, I used a spoon to get it all out.  Added the 3/4 can of evaporated milk as it says to do.  Proceded to feel like a kid mixing flour and water to do some craft project while I worked it to try to get a liquid going.  Took a taste.  OMG.  Who dreamt up this recipe?  Is this stuff raw and not to be eaten without being cooked first?  It taste like molasses and pie spice.  It looks like molasses and pie spice.  It's brown instead of orange.  OMG, who wants to buy my remaining cans?  I got 7 left.  This stuff tastes like crap if you try to use it as an uncooked sauce like Libby's.  OK, so Libby's taste like liquid pumpkin candy pudding.  It might really be typical unhealthy American diet fare.  I dunno except it tastes fabulous.  This stuff tastes like medicine in comparison.  It probably makes a very good tasting pie.  Maybe I'll nuke my mixture for a while and see if the taste improves.  Otherwise, wait till Libby has another good harvest.",3
"I am CONSTANTLY searching for HEALTHy treats for my 2 Miniature Poodles...I look for NO corn, wheat, soy or glutens, as the one is very allergy prone.<br /><br />This little treat is wonderful--and it SMELLS wonderful also.  My Amazon shipment just arrived and they have gotten to KNOW that anyone knocking on the door generally means it is more than likely for THEM...as I also buy all their food here on the subscription plan (AWESOME!!)<br /><br />Anyhow--they both did the ""hind leg dance"" until I opened the package. Per usual---the female checks it out FIRST-makes a decision - then the male will try...they both gobbled their cookie down. A perfect little size for them as a treat..and for a larger dog--a perfect training aid!",5
"I fell in love with Good Earth Original Sweet and Spicy tea while visiting a friend earlier this year. I live in Brazil and immediately ordered a pack of 6 - this time in the organic version. Although it still is, by all means, a delicious tea, the non-organic version is better. Still, I'm very happy with it and will drink the tea even on a hot day (and there are many over here!).",4
"I love these large bags! I use these onion rings for coating baked chicken and pork chops and the large size is very convenient and a much better value than the smaller sizes found in the grocery stores. I am able to find this large size at Sam's, but only around the Thanksgiving season. I suppose they feel we use these large sizes during holidays.",5
"I had this coffee during my trip to Paris, it was very good. I bought this coffee but it was not fresh or had the same aroma as the one I had in Paris, I don't think I will buy it again.",2
"The customer service is terrible.  Do not purchase if you are stuffing hot dogs.  This company thinks a wiener is a tiny breakfast sausage and not an American frankfurter.  The casing is too small for a standard hot dog tube.  Oh yeah, they'll keep your money.",1
"I was an avid fan of Horizon's chocolate milk until the recent change of last month.  Everything about their product has been cheapened: the carton, the price, but most importantly, the taste.  It used to taste like creamy chocolate pudding.  Perhaps they use less chocolate, but the taste is no longer there.",2
Tastes horrible. Its too sweet and it tastes very artificial. I got this k-cup flavor in a variety pack. I will not buy this flavor. Its really gross.,1
"I love KC Masterpiece BBQ sauces, but I'm not impressed with this marinade.  Perhaps I'm not sure exactly how to use it...but it's too garilicy for the chicken dishes and seems to have an after taste I'm not fond of...<br /><br />I gave some to a co worker and she liked it, so it could just be me.",2
"It seemed like our dogs were getting tired of the same old thing for dinner, so I did some research and found this Wellness brand dog food. What I liked about it was the lack of by-products and cereals. Our dogs love the taste of this food and there is never any left in their bowls. It is a well baqlanced food that good for them also and having it shipped directly to my door saves us a trip to the pet stores. I count on Amazon for the best products.",5
"This product is wonderful.  Gluten free bread is usually so bad - dry, tasteless.  Pamela's makes wonderful products that are so-o-o good.  This flour can be used for bread, pie crust, or pizza, among other things.  The pie crust is even better than the regular recipe I used to use.  We have not found any Pamela's product that is less than most satisfactory.  We will continue to buy these products.",5
"First of all, to those afraid their dog will get to much protein from the best quality dog foods ..feed your dog according to his weight and instructions on the bag! Use caution and research for his daily needs according to his weight if feeding high protein wet & dry food at the same time in seperate bowls. If you dont, don't blame Orijen if he gets elevated liver enzymes. Blame yourself for not doing your homework!<br />Glycemic Research Institute, Washington, D.C has awarded Orijen another Pet Food of the Year award.

"I have had a K-cup machine at work for a year or two; and one at home for over a month; I am an addict for strong coffee/ we have a club at work (not k-cup related) and we get PEETS' coffee/ its really bold and rich.<br /><br />I have had most every extra-bold roast for the K-cup machine. In my opinion, the Black tiger is a great tangy bold coffee with enough earthiness too but nicely powerful and flavorful. A great combination. A double dose of this in the travel mug and its heaven. If you are like me and like dark coffee that actually still has flavor... You will really love this one.",5
"I bought these bottles because I liked the angled look and the afforable price. After using them a few times for my two month old, I can honestly say I strongly dislike them. I only recommend these if you want to see and hear air while your baby is sucking. The nipples are SO slow!! It takes my son almost 30 minutes to finish 4.5 ounces! Using Dr. Brown's bottles, it only takes about half that time. The Evenflo bottles also tend to leak, even with the nipple secured tightly. Save your money for something better.",1
"This used to be my must-have food for my hiking, biking or xc skiing trips, but no longer so since the maker changed their cans.<br /><br />It is superior in terms of taste than most of other brands I tried (from Wholefoods) for two reasons:<br />- It uses wild Alaskan pink salmon. This type of salmon has higher fat content and is much more tastier than the leaner/dryer sockeye salmon.<br />- It is canned in its own juice instead of spring water.<br /><br />I have had the older version (the one w/ attached can opener) for years. The new can does not have opener anymore as of July 2012 at Amazon and Wholefoods. The product picture is outdated. As I buy these cans strictly for my outdoor trips, attached can opener was a crucial feature to me. Therefore, I take off 2 star for this product.<br /><br />For now, I will stick to their canned tuna that is still packed in cans with an opener.",3
"I started using peppermint oil for my sebhorriac dermatitis and someone said to try the tea for digestion and irritable bowel syndrome.  Though I have only used it twice, I have to admit it did help me. Not sure if that is just a coincidence or that it worked.  But two times is enough to convince me to keep using it!!",5

"When an incorrect order of Senseo coffee pods arrived I opened a bag to try, thinking I would just go with it, and the coffee as labeled was fine...<br />I just have an addiction to hazelnut, and I will probably offer the one that came to guests and friends who prefer the unflavored<br />variety...I do appreciate the refund...",3
"This pasta is hot enough that with an appropriate sauce, such as a Thai peanut sauce, it's hard to stop eating.  I add fried sweet potatoes and garden serranos.  Sort of like a moderately hot salsa, there's an instinct to just keep eating it.  It isn't so hot that it is unpleasant to eat and it doesn't have any chili flavor of its own.<br /><br />You can eat it with a marinara and I do, seasoning it with red pepper flakes.  I'm not a heat freak by any stretch and neither are my dinner guests, but the kick is a welcome alternative and the foundation for many great dishes.  This also goes well with an alfredo or other cream sauce.  I wouldn't recommend it for something Mediterranean styled full of delicate flavors such as capers and olive oil.  Whether it goes well with pesto or is sort of a waste of pesto is debatable.  It's a great base to Indian dishes with goat cheese and lots of fresh vegetables like squashes, zucchini, cauliflower, and so on.<br /><br />Rossi Pasta's website has this same size at the same price.  (I keep trying to order on it, but it makes you recover the password for the account you didn't want to create each time and then still can't process the order.  It might be one of those ""it only works with IE"" deals that works for most people, but just barely.)<br /><br />As long as I'm griping, I'd like to see a bit better price on this bulk size.  $5/pound is pretty steep for pasta.  The gourmet, hand-made stuff in the unaffiliated corner organic grocery has some delicious locally made pasta in small quantity for the same price per pound.  I do buy that sometimes, but I'm hooked on the unique possibilities of Rossi's Fire Pasta.",5
"didnt know there was tea in the pack-wasnt specified anywhere. I dont like the tea that was in there,and wouldnt have ordered it. Some of the coffee pods were too weak.",1
"I can not believe the lack of packaging from this company!! The coffee k-cups were thrown into a Ziploc baggie...then shipped! I had intended to give this as a Christmas gift, but am unable to do so now. It looks like I have just gone to my own cabinet and thrown some stuff in a bag.There is no expiration date on the bag, so as far as I know, the k-cups could already be expired and the company is just trying to move their leftover stock onto the unsuspecting consumer. Additionally, the lack of variety was disheartening. I will NEVER buy from the BECCO Corp. again. If I could give this less than 1 star, I most certainly would! I would also add that although the advertisement was for caffeinated coffee only, I received several decaffeinated coffees. Oh,and I have already checked to see if I could return this item. I can not because it is a grocery item and they are non-returnable. To summarize...buyer beware!",1
"I tried these and wanted to like them, but just couldn't.  They did not seem to ""pop"" very well (a lot of wasted product in the bag) and they didn't taste very good.  I will not be buying these again.",2
"I have bought k-cups from amazon before and this was the first time that I bought the Van Houtte and am disappointed , not so much in the taste but that many of the cups in this order where defective and would drain all of the coffee grounds into my cup or just soak up the water and not drain at all. I would suggest that people do not buy these.",2
"These vitamuffins are absolutely yummy.  I first bought the already made muffins at the supermarket for $5.00, quantity of 4.  I thought they were delicious but didn't want to spend so much money on just 4 muffins.  Then I found the mix on Amazon and thought it was absolutely worth the money.  You get 12 muffins from each box which is twice as many muffins for about the same price and they're so easy to make, you can't go wrong.  Just be careful when making them though, the box says to put the oven at 400 degrees and bake for 23-27 minutes but the first box I made got burned on the bottom when I listened to those instructions.  The second box I made came out perfect.  I pre-heated the oven at 300 degrees and when I put them in, raised the temperature to 325 degrees and baked for approximately 17-18 minutes, checked them once in between that time.  I don't know if my oven just gets too hot or what but just keep an eye on them.  Other than that, it's a great and healthy snack and if you're on Weight Watchers like I am, for 1 point a muffin, you just can't get anything better than that to satisfy that chocolate craving.",5
"I am a coffee nut & very particular about my blend.  I used to be hooked on Seattle's Best, Henry's Blend until they changed formula and went to the number ID for their blends, NOT the same, my endless search began.  Months later I tried the med. roast Colombian Narino blend at the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf store and was quite impressed.  I purchase through Amazon subscribe & save program, the same blend.  The in store grind is more robust & sharper in flavor but the convenience of subscribe & save and taste is fine for me and I look forward to each month's delivery.",4
"This site had the cheapest price, including shipping, that I could find... 4.6 cents per bag, but that was for an order of 1000 bags....the bags came loosely dropped in a generic box so really don't know that I actually received 1000 bags, but I suspect that count was close.  Picture shows the bags in 3 colors.  I received all green bags.  I didn't really care about the color, but saw no means of selecting a color.  If bag color is important to you, then I suggest that you call or email the company prior to paying.  Shipping was prompt.  Overall satisfied; I wouldn't hesitate to re-order from this company.",4
"My five-year-old daughter shouted ""delicious!"" upon her first bite and loved the amount of chocolate on the bottom side of the bar. Perhaps that led me to expect too much since I hadn't taken a bite yet, but I felt like this was just okay. I think the title ""chocolatey peanut butter"" is misleading; while peanut butter chips were on the bar, they were too few. I could barely taste the peanut butter, only noticing a hint. My husband, who loved peanut butter, was disappointed too.<br /><br />The description on the box of ""chewy"" is accurate, almost to a fault. The thickness of the bar - with rolled oats second on the ingredients list and rice not too much farther down - made chewing go on and on, without much flavor throughout. Most of the chocolate and peanut butter chips are on the outside; the chewing would have been fine if the flavor lasted all the way through the bar and not just on the exterior.<br /><br />All in all, they were fine. They just weren't great.",4
"This coffee is slightly better than your average supermarket coffee.  The vanilla flavor is very faint.  If you are looking for vanilla coffee, adding vanilla syrup to your coffee is a better choice.  I prefer fresh roasted coffee from Peets or my local coffee shop.  This is not bad, but lacks that fresh roasted taste.  I rate it average.",2
"I love Eden Organics in that they 1) are organic and 2) they use cans that are BPA free. This is worth it to me. They taste great after cooking them and mixing with other foods. I am not much for plain beans. I do use them to make black bean burgers, which are quite yummy.",5

"I was curious so I bought one at the store and waited for a night where I had nothing to do and could sleep as late as I wanted.  Nyquil knocks me out, I need 6-8 hours of free time to sleep with it so I didn't want to take my chances with this.  45 minutes after I finished the bottle I felt loopy and needed to sleep.  4 hours later I woke up with a massive head ache.  It knocked me out big time, but now I have a bad head ache.  I may keep a bottle in the fridge for a long night, but there's no way I would drink this on a regular basis, my head hurts way too much now.",2
"My puppy liked the taste of the food, but he had the runs the entire time I fed him Wellness. Never had it before this brand, and as soon as I switched to a different brand, he was fine again. Would not recommend.",1
"I am a Gummi addict! That said, I doubt I will buy these a second time. Most of them are great but some of the flavors have an odd flavor. It's not that it's a bad flavor necessarily, it's just odd.",4
"I purchased these candies because a reviewer stated they had ""no laxative effect like other"" candies.<br /><br />I don't believe I have ever experienced a worse laxative effect from ANY candy.<br /><br />Yes they taste good. But after only two servings (8 pieces/ 70 calories) I experienced horrible side effects.<br /><br />I was not positive they were the cause so I tried them on three separate occasions and had the same results.<br /><br />Perhaps different people respond differently but I can certainly attest to the nasty side effects based on my own experience.",2
"It's beyond me why this stuff has such great reviews. If you like the taste of burnt popcorn, then this coffee is for you! If you're like most people, however, and you're looking for a rich coffee taste DO NOT buy Lavazza... Yuck. Now I have to figure out how to get rid of the other 3 bags, don't think I can bring myself to use them.",1
"I recently gave up coffee, but still felt I needed a little boost first thing in the morning.  The nice spicy ginger tea is great for waking me up and love the lemon-ginger flavor.<br /><br />I like the convienence of using Subscribe and Save program so will always have the tea on hand.  Highly Recommend this tea!",5
"If you've ever had raw cacao nibs, you should realize immediately that these nibs are roasted.  I contacted the seller about this, and here is what I said, and how they responded:<br /><br />Me:<br />Hi.  I received 5 lbs. of Cacao nibs yesterday, but they are not raw like I ordered.  These distinctively smell and taste like roasted nibs.  After I noticed this, I looked at the bag.  The label says that it is Organic, but doesn't mention being raw (Organic, Herbal Essence Cacao Nibs).  Do you want to send me some raw nibs or give me a refund?<br />Thanks,<br />Dan<br /><br />Them:<br />Raw Nibs are so bitter if not roasted, All cacao nibs have to be roasted at low temperature.<br />All our customers love them, try it, if you chose not to use it, fine please return the 5 lbs bag for a refund.<br />thank you<br />imed<br /><br />So, they've decided that since raw nibs don't taste as good, they're going to roast them.  (Why not throw in some cream and sugar while you're at it?  They taste really good like that!).  It's fine if you want to roast them, just don't market them as raw!<br />But, I decided to give them the benifit of the doubt.  Maybe they ""roast"" their cacao at a low enough temperature to still be considered raw.  I emailed them back:<br /><br />Me:<br />At what temperature do you roast your cacao?<br /><br />Them:<br /> below 80 degrees.<br /><br />Below 80 degrees?  That's gotta be celsius right?  A quick conversion tells me they roast their supposedly raw cacao at 175 degrees.  That's not raw by any standard.<br />I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt one more time.  They did say that ""all cacao nibs have to be roasted...""  So I emailed Navitas Naturals about their raw cacao nibs (I was eating Navitas nibs before trying these).  Navitas processes their cacao below 118 degrees, making their cacao truly raw.  Halaleveryday is clearly a shady company who should not be trusted.  Yes, these nibs taste better than raw nibs, but you're not buying raw cacao for the taste.  I advise staying away from Halaleveryday, Alive and Aware, and Herbal Essence products.<br /><br />How are these roasted nibs?  They taste much more like chocolate than raw cacao does, and are much crispier and easier to chew.  There are definitely some hard pieces (pieces of shell, I assume?), so watch out for your teeth if you decide you can trust this company enough to eat their products.",1
"Ughh..... My gawd. These things taste awful. Has no flavor, no kick, barely even fizzes. It's rather terrible. A local charity drive received some of these and sent this off to some hungry kids in Cambodia and the kids sent the entire shipment back saying they rather risk drinking the cholera-laden water from the nearby stream. I cant recommend anyone drinking this unless they've previously had their taste buds burned off with sulfuric acid. In that case....bottoms up!<br /><br />2 stars...one extra because it's only 99 cents at most stores for when you have no money to quench the thirst and Arizona or Brisk arent available.",2
"I was skeptical at first with the previous reviews and this being the only variety Starbucks k-cups that's advertised on Amazon. But I received exactly as it was advertised. The shipping was a bit slow, but arrived as promised. Price is a little high compared to $34 for 54 k-cups (Starbucks Cafe Verona) in Costco, but if you want variety, you pay for it! Planning to order again in a couple of weeks.",4
"I had wondered how HIT removed the trans fat from their cookies.  While hoping that they would have replaced the ""bad fat"" with a poly or mono unsaturated fat they have chosen to go with palm and coconut oil, two of the  nutritionally worst ""vegetable oils"", to make matters worse they fully hydrogenate these oils making the ratio of fat that is found in the cookies 86% saturated (6gm/7gm)!<br /><br />Nutritionally one could do better by picking almost any other cookie - so I'd recommend skipping this one.",2
"Imagine yourself craving coffee. But you're on... a big ferry boat. With a single coffee vending machine. The kind that you wouldn't venture near if you had any choice in the matter. But you need a hot beverage, or the caffiene, or something warm to hold, whatever. So you bite. The paper cup shoots out of some recess in the machine, and a close approximation of coffee pours into said cup, with the familiar, but suspect aroma of vanilla in the air. Then you taste it - and yup, it's exactly as vending machine icky as you hoped it wouldn't be. You taste the artificial, and you learn to settle for it. Because you're stuck on a boat.<br /><br />Well, Grove Square Capuccino Cups, French Vanilla - are just a little better than that. A smidgen better, not much more.<br /><br />So if you aren't stuck on a ferry boat (or train station, or gas station, or local DMV waiting area or someplace equally dismal), and if you actually do have a choice, I would urge you to at least try before you buy. So you aren't stuck with 23 k-cups that make you cringe :)",2

"After reading some of the other reviews, I was expecting more flavor to the  tea.  It is good.  I let it infuse a bit longer than other flavors to encourage the flavor development.",4
"I and I eagerly awaited tasting this, but came away disappointed.  Like many others have pointed,out, this comes accross as just a little too weak.  At first I thought I had miscalculated the amount of water, but it takes two bags to make an 8 oz cup with acceptable body and flavor.  It seems like a nice concept, but the execution is not there yet.  Kudos for the attractive packaging and spirit behind the concept though.",3
"I bought a 16-ounce bag of Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal a few months ago and have been using it ever since. I have heard that you shouldn't keep it that long once you open it, but I haven't noticed any problems. The bag says ""keeps best refrigerated or frozen,"" and I keep it in the refrigerator. I add about a tablespoon of the flaxseed meal to a ~16-ounce smoothie I blend fresh every morning, and I love it for that purpose! It doesn't really add any flavor that I've noticed, but I do believe it makes my pumpkin smoothies taste more like pumpkin PIE smoothies (I guess the flaxseed meal taste and texture reminds me of a pie crust being crumbled into the mix). I used more flaxseed meal in my smoothies a few times when the bag tipped out more than I was expecting, and it just made the smoothie thicker than I intended (not a big deal). The blender I use is a cheap single-serve blender, so it doesn't grind the meal up very much more than the original product straight out of the bag, but the texture doesn't bother me. The texture is not a fine powder like flour, nor is it sand-like as with cornmeal...it's flaky. I do have to wash my cup out within a few hours of finishing my smoothie, or the meal flakes will stick to the sides and make handwashing difficult.<br />I have used it once as an egg substitute in a box cake recipe (for each egg, use 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal and 3 tablespoons of water; stir and let sit for about five minutes to get a bit gummy). Though the cake turned out okay, I'd probably not use it that way again. The cake density was a bit off, and my husband didn't like finding little flakes of flaxseed meal in his cake. He is fine with it in his smoothies, though.",4
"Our family has tried just about every gluten-free pancake mix on the market. Bisquick is one of the best! Two members of our family have celiac disease and three of us don't, but we all love this mix for our tradition of Saturday morning pancakes. The only other gluten-free pancake mix we like even better is: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005XP3R4I"">Nuffins Gluten Free Pancake Mix - Case of 6</a> It's not always available on Amazon, but when it is we try to stock up. Nuffins is definitely worth trying! Their other products are great too. Otherwise it's Bisquick or Pamelas for our family.<br /><br />The only ""con"" I can think of is the price. At $5.00+ per pound, this mix is expensive. If you agree, mark this review as helpful! Maybe the good folks at Betty Crocker will take notice.",5
"I had been drinking Knudson's Just Black Jerry juice for several years to prevent gout, and it worked.  But when the stores in my area were no longer stocking it, I had to find an alternative. This was the 2nd different one which I tried. While it appears all the ones I tried still help me stay away from gout pain, this one had an added affect. Yes, diarrhea. It took me a few days to figure it out. I had been drinking it for about a week and was feeling well other then the extra trips to the bathroom. Figured it had to be something I was eating or drinking. This was the only ""new"" thing I had introduced. So I stopped drinking it and within 24 hours my bowels were back to normal and have stayed back to normal.  Also fortunately the Knudson Just Black Cheery juice was back in stock at my store, so I am back on it and have no unwanted side affects. The store manager told me it was a back order issue with Knutson.  So all is well today.  And I have always had a pretty strong stomach. I pity those who do not.",1
"This product arrived in great condition and tasted great. The main complaint is the exorbitant cost. It was almost twenty dollars originally although the seller later credited two dollars after we completed a review of their service which was excellent. By the time we added shipping costs, we had almost thirty dollars tied up in a 12 pack can of pop. I will just live without it in the future.",4

"Had seen this product described on some TV show and thought ""This'll taste great!"" You know, because I love cherry and bubblegum flavors.<br /><br />The best way to describe this strange jelly's flavor, however, is ""weird."" It doesn't really taste like cherry, and much less like bubblegum than I'd thought. I haven't tried it yet with peanut butter and that may help hide some of its medicinal taste.",2
"This coffee isn't worth the extra money.  It's no better than any low cost Keurig Cups.  They're hammering you on the ""Starbucks"" name, but the coffee tastes nothing special.  Certainly NOT like regular Starbucks coffee.",2
My husband takes this in his lunch for work.  It's great in the hot weather for those who work outdoors and need hydration.,5
"I would not buy this again.  I have purchased the Coco Lopez brand in the past, which has a much fresher coconut taste.  Like another reviewer said, this brand is pure sugar and preservatives.  I am currently in a wheelchair recovering from a fractured pelvis and cannot go shopping (most of my friends are just too busy) so I purchased this brand online.  In retrospect I should have paid a bit more for the Coco Lopez brand as it actually tastes like real coconut and has real coconut fat in it as I kept it in the fridge and the fat separated (remember, in moderation coconut fat is good for you, with many health benefits).  This brand just stays like a syrup in the fridge, no separation.  I will not be purchasing this again and as soon as I can I will be giving the rest away.",1
"The cashew and almond bar is very tasty. I eat these whenever I am hungry and want a healthy snack. I noticed that when I eat these before working out, they give me energy too.<br />I love these bars! They are nice and chewy and crunchy with the nuts in it. Very tasty combination and I highly recommend.",5
"This cereal is pretty good, though it really tastes a lot like Honey Bunches of Oats and, consequently isn't really a new market in the cereal industry.  I gave it three stars because in addition to the lack of originality I had hoped for, I found it a bit sweet for my tastes.  My two kids, however, liked it - neither is overly accustomed to sweet cereals so maybe I am overly sensitive to the sweetness in this box.<br /><br />If you like Honey Bunches of Oats, you will probably like this (though this one has slightly less crunch to it).  As I said, it is ""okay"" but I probably won't purchase it again unless maybe I have a great coupon.",3
"This is a good, consistant, and quality product.  I buy it buy the case in order to keep from making late runs to the store.  Our little one had quite a bite of acid reflux which seems to now have subsided.  She's 7 months now.  I can say that in experimentation with other products, it's nice to have found one that works as well as any other and it's not the most expensive.  Fortunately our baby's tummy was okay with it.  So for us it worked just fine.",4
"Some people are concerned about this product being made in China, personally I think it's fine, since it's from the largest rice cracker manufacturer in the world, they should have decent quality control systems-- after all, the ingredients from the frightening food scandals in China never appears in any of their product that's made in China. (Interestingly, some of their adult rice snacks made in Taiwan were involved).<br /><br />However, I hope I've read the nutrition facts before purchasing this product:it has sugar and sodium. Baby food are not supposed to have sugar and salt added into it. THEY ARE FOR ADULTS! Especially, the sodium per serving for this product is about 2/3 the value for reduce fat potato chips. Since you cannot return grocery purchases on Amazon, think twice before you buy this. My daughter is 8 months old, I'll probably give her this after she's 12 months old -- since I cannot return this anyway, but I won't give her too much in a day simply because of they added salt into this product.",3
"The negative reviews are right, this green tea is horrible. I wouldn't even call it green tea. It tastes like an ashtray smells. I'm very disappointed because Lipton is usually really good.",1

"I have ordered probably $500 of jerky from various online companies in the last 3 years and I can say this is for sure the best jerky I have ever had.  The hickory flavor is great and salty.  It's the kind of snack you just can't stop eating.  The other great thing is I like the pieces, instead of long strips.  It much nicer to be able to just pop bite size pieces in your mouth, rather than try and use your side molars to rip a long piece of jerky apart.  I have probably gone through eight bags of this product and have two in the cupboard.  Just do it.",5
"Product was shipped promptly and in good condition.  It is good vanilla, but honestly I can't tell much difference in it and the McCormick I buy at the grocery store.  Would love to find a really good mexican vanilla.",3

"I sent this coffee sampler to my in-laws who are serious coffee connoisseurs, and they absolutely LOVED it! They said the taste of the coffee was very smooth and my father in-law said he didn't need to use any creamer nor sweetener when drinking the coffee. They have tried numerous types, brands, and styles of coffee and were very satisfied with this. It was wrapped according to them very lovely and made a wonderful Christmas gift. I would definitely recommend this and plan to try this for myself.",5

I would be more than happy to take the 11 bags they're trying to get rid of! lol. : ) I guess they aren't as ""healthy"" as some people would like, if you're really watching what you eat. They do have quite a bit of sugar on them, but they taste so darn good. They're still better for you to eat rather than greasy potato chips. I highly recommend them! Very delicious! : )",5
"Got this babycook as a family gift and am very disappointed. The steamer works well, although the reports about the steaming well developing odor are scary. The blender works for about a half second until it spins freely, all the food stuck below it, not processed to where I can feed it to the baby. Maybe I'm not getting this right? I am following the instructions from the cookbook (small portions). So the rest has to be mashed with a fork and then there is still cleaning to do. I don't see how this is easier/faster than a proper blender...",1

"I've used MUSCLE MILK for three years and like the taste and always felt that it gave me enough Protein (32 g) and Calories (640), but with 18 g of Fat.<br /><br />REGEN has less than 1/3 of Calories (good), less than 1/4 of Fat (good), same amount of Potassium (good), three times the Carbohydrate (?), 1/3 the amount of Protein (bad) and the same amount of Calcium.<br /><br />MUSCLE MILK (15 servings)<br />Calories 640<br />Total Fat 18 g<br />Potassium 600 mg<br />Total Carbohydrate 12 g<br />Protein 32 g<br />Calcium<br /><br />REGEN (24 servings)<br />Calories 200<br />Total Fat 4.5 g<br />Potassium 525 g<br />Total Carbohydrate 35 g<br />Protein 11 g<br />Calcium<br /><br />Regen doesn't taste bad and I like the fact that it has Cocoa (important anti-oxidant) and you don't have to mix it.  But REGEN is about one dollar more expensive, serving to serving.  Since I've never had an issue with Calories but wanted the Protein, REGEN falls way short on that. Compare these ingredients with the price and although REGEN is a good product; for the price, I am sticking with MUSCLE MILK.",3

"The formula is wonderful - I haven't had a single problem since I started using it when my baby was 3 months old.  He's now 9mths and is still doing great on this stuff...I'm just glad he's almost near the end of his formula days since it's the price (specifically the Amazon price) I'm not happy with.<br /><br />I've been buying this formula from Amazon since March 2012 - and at that time it was the best price out there - $36.70 for a 6pk ($6.12/bottle).<br /><br />Then by August the price had jumped to $38.16 ($6.36/bottle) - but still the cheapest price out there, so I wasn't complaining.<br /><br />Now - October - the price has jumped yet again to $41.94 ($6.99/bottle)  - making it more expensive than Walmart or Target.<br /><br />The seller has always been Amazon (not another seller through Amazon) - so it's not a change in seller causing the price changes.  I just hope the price raises were out of necessity...and I guess I'll have to take my $180 a month elsewhere from now on.",3
Calm products are wonderful.  Used as directed will bring positive results.  I gave this a 4 star rating because I tried the orignal flavor Calm and like it better.,4

"Nature's Path makes very good cereals. I no longer eat them, since I'm gluten-free, but this was one of my favorites. The major problem for me was that I didn't eat it fast enough. Flax goes bad if it isn't stored in the fridge or freezer. By the time I'd gotten to the 3rd box, the cereal tasted rancid - even though it wasn't near its expiration date. I don't know if it was a bad batch, or it got too warm in the warehouse, or during delivery, but I've never had that happen before with other cereals. The cranberry Nature's Path cereal I bought at the same time was fine. Maybe this one isn't so good for buying in bulk?",3
"Since I am a fan of flavored coffee, particularly coffee flavored with natural ingredients, I knew I had to try this coffee. As soon as I opened the package to brew a pot, my kitchen smelled of hints of vanilla (my four year old son even asked me if I was baking something).  If anything, the aroma is most satisfying when drinking this coffee, but the taste isn't too strong. In sum, this coffee is good because of its aroma and delicious taste.  I am certainly impressed with Starbucks' new vanilla addition, and I will most definitely continue purchasing this coffee. For a two pack purchase on Amazon, the price is quite reasonable. Bottom line: if you enjoy drinking a nice scented coffee, this one is a must-try!",5
"I am gonna keep this short and sweet. As a long time fan of all chips that are salt & vinegar, I have to say I found my one. Not too salty or pungent with vinegar, but just the right amount of flavor and crispiness. I am so glad I decided to try a box of these. You guys have a winner here.",5
"The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again.",2
"No matter how highly rated of a kibble we would get for our little shih tzu & yorkie mix, she would throw up about three times per week.  Once we switched to this raw dehydrated meal at the recommendation of some folks at a local pet store who have a pomeranian with a sensitive tummy, the problem was solved!  Even if she would get into something she was not supposed to, no vomiting, seemed to do miracles for her digestive track in general, so was very pleased!  Have also used the chicken formula, which we have had a great experience with, as well.  Also - she LOVES it!  To save money, we would buy the large 8 pound bag and I am very sad that the price has recently risen so drastically (Nov. of 2011 from $60 per bag to $75, BIG jump).  Because of the price increase, we had switched to Grandma Lucy's (Artisan freeze-dried), with equal success as far as no vomiting and her loving the food, but have switched back to Addiction because she was looking thin, as if the protein content was not enough.  I would recommend calling around to specialty feed stores in your area to find the absolute best price.",4
"We are Kool-aid drinkers in our home so I was really excited to try Peach Mango Kool-aid. I love peach and mango flavors so I was sure this would be a hit with me. It was just okay for me. The peach and mango flavoring is very light. Also the sugar was a bit too much. I found myself having to add more Kool-aid than was suggested to get the fruit flavor to be stronger. I could taste the sugar no problem but I really wanted to taste more of the fruit flavoring. Even my kids, who are sugar fiends thought the sugary taste was too much. They also agreed that it needed a stronger fruit flavor. The Kool-aid does mix well and the sugar does dissolve well. It was an okay flavor.",3
"After reading the reviews I was excited to try this coffee substitute. When I received it I tried to brew a cup in my keurig k-cup. It would not brew in the k-cup, I think its too dense when it gets wet.  So I then tried it in a regular coffee maker.  I followed the directions on the bag and the beverage came out weak.  It was undrinkable. So I tried the coffee maker again, but this time I added extra grounds and it still came out weak.  Last I tried my French Press and it worked pretty good. The taste is not bad, its similar to coffee, but it does have an aftertaste. Whats missing is the bitterness in coffee that I like. I actually prefer Teeccino over this.",2
"I love tea.  I have at least 10 different types of tea at home at any time.  I rarely try a tea I don't like.  But this one (Russian Caravan) defies all rules - it's so strong (not as in ""strong tea"" but as in ""strong flavor""), it's impossible to drink without some preparation.  One friend of mine calls it ""camel feet"" tea, and I'm afraid in this case, I have to agree.",2
"Half way through the supply, I noticed that there were tiny white worms boring through a greenie so I checked the remaining greenies and they also had worms.

This may have been an isolated incident but it would only take a few minutes to check the contents for freshness.",1
"I was looking for a good instant organic plain oatmeal and settled for this variety due to added flax seed. I was a little disappointed with the taste. To be fair, I missed the fact that this has added sugar but wanted to mention it so others don't overlook it. But, the oatmeal had an underlying aftertaste. It reminded me a bit of cardboard (not that I eat cardboard but it took on that smell). I usually buy Trader Joes boxed instant and the taste can't even compare to TJ's variety. Darn it. I liked the convenience and price.",2
"I like Kung Pao but this Kung Pao was far too sweet.  Like most producers of food for the American market,Annie Chun felt it necessary to add a sweetener (evaporated cane juice).  For my taste, sweeteners are for desserts. I would have rated it higher, had it not been too sweet.",3
"I love the color of this shirt and the material is very lightweight.  The sized run about a size small.  The shirt sort of shapes easily to pulls.  If I pull at my shirt a little bit in one spot, I get a ""bubble"" kind of where I pulled at it.  It's a stretchy-ish material and I think that causes it, but it sometimes ends up looking funny because of it.",3
"I was pretty excited to receive a sample of Eat, Think, Smile's chewy granola bar.

Crispy Thins, Red Raspberry, 6-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>.<br />First these bars are not very chewy and second they are rather dry.<br />I can taste the chocolate & berry flavors, and one bar makes a healthy and filling snack, but this just reminds me of diet food, boring and bland, but filling.<br />I'll stick with their crispy thins, those I'd run to get more.",3
This was my own fault for not reading the small print but just to save someone else my fate - these are the smallest of boxes not the movie-size boxes!  I can get this product in the movie-size for $1.00 locally.  This small box cost me almost doouble that.  Lesson learned.,1
"I tried these kcups because the reviews were good. It is a very good high quality coffee and very smooth, but as far as being xtra bold it was not. Its not weak but not xtra bold like most said it was. I usually drink emerils exbold, or green mountain dark magic these are the two I would recommend for those who like a very ,very strong cup of coffee. also tullys italian roast is also another kcup I recommend for bold coffee drinkers. I am waiting for a delivery of green mountain double black diamond I will make sure i give a review when I taste it lol.",3
"I love yogi tea, pretty much every flavor I have tried.  This tea tastes good but I have had no detox effects with this one.  I've used the berry detox and that one really works well so I'm not sure why this tea is not the same.  If you dont care about the detox part, the flavor is very pleasant and mild.",2
"I wanted some Stash Earl Grey Double bergamot tea for my Keurig. It doesn't come all nicely wrapped in its own little K-cup, but it IS loose tea and if you have the attachment to brew your own cuppa, this works great.",5
"This comapny is the best for vanilla beans.  They shipped my order within an hour of me placing it, and they arrived in the mail three days later.  The beans look and smell wonderful, plus you get free beans when you order!  I love this company!!",5
"Ok, so I have to say that I did not enjoy the True Lemon Lemonade nearly as much as I enjoyed the True Lemon Raspberry Lemonade.  It didn't have nearly as much flavor, and the flavor it did have wasn't much like lemonade to me.  But the ingredients were still pretty good, and that's really what makes this brand stand out from the others.<br /><br />True Lemon products boast that they have 100% natural ingredients.  And its true, they do.  They use stevia instead of artificial sweeteners and actual lemon oil and juice for the flavoring.  This makes me think at least that what I'm drinking is healthy.  There's even some turmeric for color in here and that's actually a beneficial spice.  So all in all, a good product on the market.  A lot healthier than some of the other drink additives out there.<br /><br />The taste, not as good in this one.  Its not terrible, like some of the water additives I've tried, but it tastes extremely weak.  That and the pale yellow color the water turns it just isn't appetizing.  Its still got a sweet taste, but the tanginess of the lemon isn't really there and it more just tastes like sugar water.  I would say their estimate on the amount of flavoring per water ratio may be off and perhaps two packets would be a better choice for the water.  It may be something I have to try.<br /><br />I probably won't buy this particular flavor from True Lemon again, but it won't stop me from trying some of their other products.  And I will definitely get their Raspberry Lemonade again.  I just hope that maybe they improve this one or keep adding new products to their line up. It sure does help when that soda craving kicks in and I can have one of these instead.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012",3
UPDATE 8/6/2012 Recent shipment to Amazon* which amounts to a 25% percent loss if just 3 cans are badly dented ........... Libby excellent products but until they stop sneaking these very badly dented cans thru to Amazon no more orders -<br /><br />>>Amazon great as always ... but here is the PROOF Libby's is processing dented cans to Amazon to unknowingly sell to consumer........... Every shipment to date has had dented cans - severely in some cases rendering product not edible per standards....this case of carrots had a can 'in the center' before they wrap to to send to Amazon warehouse. This can severely dented....BUT no marks on the wrapper - suggesting they re-wrapped before sealing to your warehouse for sale to Amazon customers ........<br />*****************<br /><br />Drain/heat/season and serve as side dish with 'microwave' scrambled eggs.<br /><br />Spray microwave-safe 2 cup dish/ scramble 2 eggs with water - NOT milk - milk toughens!<br /><br />Nuke on high one minute / spoon cooked outside edge to center allowing the uncooked to spread around the edges of the dish - 30-45 seconds more -let stand 2-3 seconds.  If dish shallow - flip out for a 'fried egg' sandwich<br /><br />Add to stews/vegetable tomato soups etc.,3
"Some reviews here call this coffee ""Bitter"" - well all I have to say to them is: ""Clean your pot"" - if you can't handle a strong cup of coffee, go buy a latte and let people who like REAL coffee define - coffee - not a non-carbonated soft drink that you want so badly.<br /><br />Of all the K-Cups, this is by far the best coffee around. It is bold, strong, and keeps you wanting more. This is why its the best selling K-Cup around. I suggest that you shop wisely online for these, and buy in quantity, this is what I do - I get usually 12 24-Pack boxes. Me and my wife drink this daily - it truly is a great tasting coffee - without any of that ridiculous flavoring that some on here want - if you drink this you better wear pants - otherwise stay in your skirt and drink some Sanka!",5
"These used to almost never be in stock.  Inventory has improved, making them more predictable.  It is a delicious flavored coffee, not too much flavor since I normally drink my coffee black.  Quite good, give it a shot!",5
"When I found out Rockstar Juiced recently changed its formula to 10% juice, I was heartbroken. I instantly fell in love with the drink when it first came out. Its 70% juice formula was to die for. When they changed it to 50% juice, I was a little disappointed since the drink seemed a little unhealthier. However, since the difference in taste was minuscule and since 50% juice is better than no juice, I let it slide. The new Rockstar Juiced is disgusting. It is packed with more sugar and calories compared to the old version and the difference in taste is very noticeable. The after feeling I got from drinking the new one was very uneasy and unsatisfying. I was an avid drinker of Rockstar Juiced. I drank at least one per day, sometimes two. I will now have to revert back to coffee & redbull. At least I am not completely heartbroken since some of my local grocery stores still carry the 50% version. But once they are completely out, goodbye Rockstar Juiced. I will miss you.",1
"But if you have high blood pressure, skip it!!  Even small amounts of black licorice root can raise your blood pressure to unhealthy levels.  The licorice in the tea is only there to add sweetness.",2
"This stuff taste the worse, no sweetner helps and it stinks up the place...Stay away from this stuff, what a waste of money.",1
I'm generally not a fan of Hazelnut coffee but even I like this one.  My husband tried this in a sample pack and loved it so I ordered them for him.  I was surprised that the cups arrived loose in the shipping box so make sure you have a container for them as this box doesn't exactly fit in the cabinet the way the small retail boxes do.  That said this coffee has a nice bold taste which works great in a big mug.  We will definitely buy more of these.,5
I didn't care for this tea.  The taste had an ashtray undertone.  I have bought other brands and loved them.  Not my cup of tea :(,1
"It just so happens that this one is an organic bean coffee k-cup; the real story is that it's quite flavorful, moderately bold, rich with a nice amount of bitterness.<br /><br />Good for any time of day, morning to night.<br /><br />It's quite flavorful in it's own right, so I do not belive it would work well as a bed for adding flavors.  Works best on the #4 setting, is passable for #5 [travel mug].",4
I appreciate that someone took the time to make a healthy lunch that is easy to take with you...no fridge needed! I enjoyed the food in my box when I really didn't have faith that it would be good. Brilliant !,4
I prepared a cup of the Doughnut House Flavor today. It tasted like water with a crayon having been dragged through it. Yuck.,1
MSG- If you like cooking with MSG this rub is for you. I'm not an anti-MSG crusader but I was shocked to see it on the ingredient list of a high-end BBQ rub. Because it's such a small item it wasn't worth returning for a refund so I put it in the swap shop at my dump. Took a small taste before I did that - it was a little sweeter than I like a dry rub. I prefer to add sweetness with sauce.,1
Very good stuff but very expensive. Sweetened with apple juice. Therefore it is not really cherry juice but cherry (juice) drink. I do not know what % of cherry juice (70% maybe) but for 2 bucks plus a bottle it should be 100% cherry juice.,3
"I was really excited to buy this food maker and get started.  After steaming and pureeing just one thing I noticed a plastic/metallic smell.  I brushed it off to the product just having that new smell.  Washed it out again and pureed more food.  Then I happened to taste the food and it had a horrible plastic or metallic taste.  I tasted different batches of things I made with all having the same result.  So instead of the food having a natural taste as the product claims, it all tastes like plastic!  I have no idea what can be causing this problem.  Maybe it will go away with time, but I certainly don't want to waste a bunch of food to perform a trial and error test over and over again. Very disappointed in the end result.",2
"I love Pepperidge farm Soft Baked Oatmeal cookies. They make the perfect snack. While other cookies are hard and dry with the texture of sawdust these cookies taste great, and are soft like they've just come out of the oven.<br /><br />Downsides? Each cookie is 130 calories which is a lot for such a small cookie. Also these contain interesterified fats/oils which are chemically altered oils. Not really great for humans to consume.<br /><br />The result? I think I'll bake my own... Without the chemicals. It would probably be safer. 5 star taste. 2 star ingredients. Rating, Average.",3
"This was just the thing I was looking for, to make a special gift for that special someone.  It may sound silly, but my fiance goes thru gum like there's no tomorrow.",5
"Weird black stuff inside the ravioli.<br /><br />Otherwise, really tasty. My favorite, but the black stuff freaked me out. Not sure if it was bugs or what. I started slicing the raviolis open. I found a lot of them have black stuff.<br /><br />I did an internet search to see if there was maybe an explanation. I found none. The ingredients are plain. I must have gotten contaminated cans or something.<br /><br />Unbelievable how people think that reporting bugs in the food, or some kind of decontamination, isn't helpful. Some people are really lame. Well, enjoy eating your bugs, idiots.",3
"You can find the same item on Amazon for $20.99 with free shipping!!  Search ""all departments"" to find this item at that price. Rated low because of price not quality.",1
I've eaten this fruitcake for several years now and it's a must for Christmas.  We love it frozen.  It was delivered from Gift Warehouse in a timely manner and in great condition.<br /><br />I would shop from this vendor again.<br /><br />You must try this fruitcake - lots of fruit and nuts.,5
"I've tried a few different flavors of Switch and this is my least favorite. (My favorite is the cherry.) Unfortunately because I didn't enjoy this flavor I didn't find it as refreshing as the others.<br /><br />I quickly handed it over to my son who does like kiwi berry flavors and he did like it a lot. Of course, since it contains enough vitamin C for a whole day, I felt just fine giving it to my child, too. No preservatives, no added sugar. I like the carbonated soda product a lot, just not this flavor.<br /><br />However, the biggest flaw with this product is that it's too expensive in my opinion for the little cans you get. Rounds out to about $1 per can. Less than you pay often with a vending machine but twice what you pay for a flavored water or vitamin C juice pouch when you buy them in larger quantity. Not worth it. :(",3
"I found this tea at a superstore a few months ago and haven't been able to find it anywhere since.  Yes, it is a little on the subtle/weak side, but it suits my needs fine.  It definitely has a delicate flavor and doesn't slam you with the usual green tea punch.  I like this as a mellow hot cup (yes, I can taste the hint of vanilla), but I truly bought it to blend teas.  I love making a 32 oz. bottle of ice tea with two black tea bags and two green tea bags.  My go-to base tea has long been <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003UEKFS0"">Twinings Tea Blackcurrant, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and I rotate other berry-ish green teas with it.  The only ones I have liked and found worth it are from Liptons superfruit green tea series.  Some of the other green teas I use have a strong flavor that can taste a little tart.  I don't use sugar in my tea, so the strength of this tea is perfect for me!  Plus it is a steal of a deal!  Yay, thank you Amazon!",4
"... IF this were not at a reduced price and was eligible for free shipping, I wouldn't have even tried it. I liked that it didn't have MSG and didn't use pork as seasoning. My family is adding more vegetables to our diet as we are ""eating better to live better"". There was an unnatural sweet taste such that I was expecting to find Sweet Potatoes somewhere, a very unsettling feeling for me. Didn't know if this batch was inadvertantly prepared with their Sweet Potatoe product. We don't like products with hidden sugar.* (*As the commenter noted sugar IS listed in the ingredients. I should have said ""unexpected sweet taste"". Truthfully I was expecting similar seasoning as in Sylvia's Collard greens.)<br /><br />I've never been to Sylvia's Restaurants so I don't really know if this is how it's supposed to taste. I won't order this again.",2
"I recieved my order quickly but the candy I recieved was close to it's expiration date, and seemed to have lost some of it's flavor.  (Please beware when ordering from The Indian Food Store/Spicy World the candy is not expired, but it is old)  In retrospect, since it just tastes like light milk chocolate (think fluffy), I would just have stayed with American Cadbury's.",3
"I likewise have my doubts that I got the right tea even though it says Golden Mango on the box and individual packages.  It does not remotely taste like mango and is somewhat bitter.  I can't identify the taste, but it ties for the worst tea I have ever tasted.  I find it odd since other reviewers have commented on how good it is with a real good mango flavor.  I don't know if I'm willing to try this again.  Others who have tasted it agree with my opinion and are unwilling to drink any more of it.",1
"This Marmalade is without a doubt the best tasting  marmalade I have ever had. Better than all the other brands that I have tried. Allthough the Dundee Orange Marmalade is outstanding, I think the Dundee 3-Fruit Marmalade has a slight edge over it.  It has a complicated citrus flavor. You can actually taste the 3 fruit's, since there are lots of pieces of rind from each in there. What an outstanding blend of flavors. This Marmalade is extremely thick, almost as though it was concentrated. It has a somewhat strong bitter sweet flavor. A little dab will go a long way.<br /><br /> This is not for everyone, if you like the sweet non bitter marmalade you might not like it. My wife does not care for it, and I think it's fantastic. Go figure.<br /><br />This brand should not be to hard to find locally, My local Publix Supermarket carries it for $7 a jar.<br /><br />UPDATE ::: July 2010; Unfortunately my local market does not carry the 3-fruit any longer only the orange. To my surprise the jar is now clear glass when I bought one the other day. What a shame I loved those white jars.",5
"I love this product.  Strawberry is one of my favorite flavors. This product sort of  reminds me of nestle quick in strawberry but its for grown ups.  For some reason I could not find  this flavor at any of the local stores in town so thank you Amazon.  I am using it to help me get something quick, nutritious, and tasty.  It has a nice smooth strawberry flavor and I know its good for me.  Hopefully it will help me loose weight.",5
"It took awhile, but I finally found a gum that doesn't contain cancerous chemicals. Unfortunately, at least for this flavor, my search isn't over.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />+ This flavor tastes really good. Fruity.<br />+ There's no artificial anything.<br />+ You won't be risking cancer by chewing this gum.<br />+ It's relatively cost effecient.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />- The sweetness lasts for less than 1 minute. Seriously.<br />- After 1 minute the flavor is gone and you'll have to eat another piece just to maintain some level of sweetness.<br /><br />That's it. Therein lies the biggest problem. This flavor isn't for sweetening your breath. It's for dessert and it only lasts approximately 30 seconds. I can eat half the box in 10 minutes and feel compelled to do so because it tastes so good.<br /><br />Maybe the mint flavor lasts longer? Or perhaps Spry gum is a better fit?",2
"I enjoy iced coffee drinks and prefer them strong. I put the can in the refrigerator to chill it rather than pour the drink over ice and dilute it. It had a nice, pleasant taste. Not too sweet with a nice smooth coffee taste but it didn't taste much like cappuccino. I usually make my own espresso and ice it, but this would be a nice alternative in an emergency or take with me in the car.",4
"Tried the original chips - they are crispy, tasty but TOO salty for me. Both chips and packet are light!",2
"I wanted to do something different for my wife for valentines day but she loves chocolate so I went looking for something new.  Turns out her family had a history with See's.  It was a special treat at holidays when she was a kid.  Not only was the candy delicious, but I got a bonus for bringing back good memories.",5
"I have a two-month old baby. We fed him with Similac Organic in first three weeks. We switched to Good Start Supreme after he had acne over his face. Acne has gone after using GS formual for two weeks(we are not sure it's because of the formula), so I bought two cans of Good Start natural Culture fascinated by the words""supporting immune system"". Since using both of GS products, we notice he has difficult to swallow. One time we saw milk was dripping out from his noses. We were trying to shake the milk well, but no matter how hard we shake, some powder never dissolve with water. We decide to switch back to Similac Advance. Considering other benefits such as easily digest, I rate it 3 stars.",3
There are no aromatics.  The coffee tastes like it is old.  There is no aroma when brewed and it tastes stale.  Just like all the other Folgers coffee.,1
This product is nothing like the picture. The one I purchased was shriveled and dying. It was about a third of the size as the one in the picture. Not a good purchase at all.,1
"I thought this syrup was gonna taste like cola, the one used to do frozen cokes, ice-cones, etc. However, it wasn't like that. This cola is for something else; perhaps is good for mixing with alcoholic beverages, or coffee, but definitely NOT for ice-cones. The taste is very strong, so I do not recommend this for kids. Don't get me wrong, it is not a bad syrup, BUT -- It is a syrup for adults to mix with ""adult"" drinks, not kids. I'm just giving it 3 stars because it doesn't specify anywhere that this product shouldn't be used to make frozen colas nor to add on icy-cones.",3
I love my Keurig machine and find the different flavored coffees to be such a nice indulgence.  I really enjoy this vanilla biscotti from Folgers.  Just has such a nice flavor and is a great afternoon treat.,5
"I have to say that I was skeptical at first to try, but the pediatrician gave me the go ahead to take it.  My baby was highly allergic to baby formula plus she was a tiny baby.  I had to find something to increase my milk supply to help increase her birth weigh quickly.  I read every amazon review and I want to write one to also help another mom.  You may or the baby may get gassy but no pains...every baby is different.  This Fenugreek capsules works! It definitely increases your milk supply. If you are an organic fanatic, they sell it too but both capsules look identical.  Good luck to all the nursing moms.",4
"i don't eat them often.. i'm not a big cookie eater..<br />i wasn't grown up with the holiday sweets, being asian, and growing up with grand parents..<br />but these are great.! the ingredients are what i love<br />when i look at the nutritional packaging, its not as attractive..<br />but the sugar and fat are from natural sources like fruit juice (which contains vitamins and minerals) and sun flower seeds and unprocessed  vegetable oil.. essential fatty acids..<br />the taste is also good, a bit too sweet for me, but i like the chewy sunfloer seeds",4
"after reading al the reviews, i tried this product and do not like the consistency. I found that if i cook it in the microwave for a few minutes before using in recipes it is slightly more palatable. this is not my favorite chicken substitute - prefer the fri chik over this product.",2
"This shampoo claims that it will, ""give you stronger, more beautiful hair in just 7 days.""<br />I completed this try out  and really have not noticed any difference between the results of it and several other shampoos that I use that are on the lower end of the price scale.<br /><br />The shampoo is extremely thick and creamy - so much so that I spent twice as long rinsing it out as any other shampoo I have used.<br />My hair is about 8 inches below my shoulders and seems to be becoming more delicate the older I get; so I will say that this did not damage or seem to be harmful in any way. In fact I had gotten sunburn on my scalp in the part of my hair and this felt very gentle on that tender spot. So if the price suits you, it would be okay.",3
"For speed and wholesome goodness, Annie's can never be beaten.  And since this is a basic mac & cheese in a bowl, I have found it works well with left-over ""add-ons"" like vegies or a variety of meats.  I can have a filling, ""good for you"" meal in less than 5 minutes.  And kids love it too!",4
Glennys organic soy crisps have always been my favorite brand until the last few times I've ordered the 6 pack from amazon.  The crisps are overcooked and have a burnt flavorless taste to them. I wind up throwing out most of the bags because they taste like cardboard. I'm given up on Glenny's organic crisps.,2
"So Amazon suggested this as an alternative to Crawford Garibaldi biscuits.  Being how I am in search of a suitable replacement for the old Sunshine raisin biscuits, I figured I'd give 'em a try.  What a mistake.  Not only they are nothing like the Sunshines, they are nothing like the Garibaldis either.  The pictures on the package are quite misleading, suggesting that there is actual fruit to be found inside the biscuits.  Not so.  Yeah, there's a couple of raisin specks in each biscuit, but if you didn't already know that you'd be hard-pressed to figure out what kind of fruit it was supposed to represent.  On the upside?  Well, the dog likes them.  So I won't bother to return them as she is a good dog and deserving of things that she thinks are a treat.  You probably won't find them very treat-like unless you long for dried out wafers with vaguely representational fruit-specks in them.  Get the Garibaldis instead. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DKT8AC"">Crawfords Garibaldi Biscuits 100g (case of 12)</a>",1
"Just The Cheese snacks are perfect for low-carb dieters searching for a crunchy alternative to chips and other junk food. How many times have we been at the movies and smelled the buttery popcorn, yet knew if we caved in we would blow our carb allowance.<br /><br />Here's the alternative. Slip a bag in to the movies and you're set. They're also perfect for travel, a quick breakfast or snack, or any time you get a chips craving. I love that one bag has 20 g of protein and nearly 2/3 of the calcium RDA.<br /><br />While others have called JTC snacks dry and too salty, I rather like the flavor and mouth feel (as they say in the food industry).<br /><br />I do have a problem with the company proclaiming that ""nothing else [has been] added"" other than cheese. Here are the Herb & Garlic flavor ingredients: cheese, powdered cellucose, maltodextrin, disodium phosphate, spices, dehydrated garlic, dextrose, parsley, citric acid, natural garlic flavor. Ok, a FEW more ingredients than ""just"" the cheese!<br /><br />They're also pricey, though if you purchase them through Amazon they only come out to a little more than one dollar a bag. While the bags aren't huge, they are quite filling thanks to the high fat content. (240 of the 300 calories in the bag come from fat. And for the saturated fat-phobic, one bag has 14 g of saturated fat.)<br /><br />If you're on the fence, I would suggest trying a bag (see if your local health food store carries them) before buying the box. Your taste may be different, but for me JTC snacks are a flavorful and portable idea.",4
"I'm not a fan. If you like dense and dry, like a pack of desicated Fig Newtons compressed into a single bar, then Larabars may be for you, but they're not for me.",2
"Really good. I like it and I would drink this before or after a workout or run. My son who runs also thought it was really good. My other son did not like it too much. I can taste the pomegranate. The son that liked it gave it double thumbs up. I think it's light enough for an every day drink before working out. It has lots of vitamins and good stuff for you. Not so sure about that, but I am sure it tastes good.",4
"Pretty good value compared to buying at the store. I also notice that it doesn't smell as strong (which is good for me), and my dog enjoys them. My medium sized dog chews through about one a day or two days.<br /><br />-update:-<br />I noticed my dog getting loose stool with whitish color for a few days - and thought maybe it might be the rawhide. Stopped giving it to him, and problem solved. So - this product does not sit well with my dog.",3
My husband loved these.  I had purchased them as a surprise for father's day.  He savored everyone of them.  will need to reorder soon.,5
"I discovered these on a whim at a discount store and they were surprisingly delicious. They have an awesome crunch and great potato flavor. The best part was the nutrition stats: only 110 calories, 1.5 fat, and 2 fiber per ounce (which is a much larger portion than expected and very satisfying). The original flavor is very good, but could use a touch more salt. The jalapeno is also really tasty: a little sweet, a little smoky, and just a little spicy.",4
"My five-year-old is coming off a bad cold which resulted in a slight loss of weight.  His pediatrician suggested that we improve his diet of veggies...a slight task to engage for a child that doesn't care for the healthful foods.<br /><br />I decided to supplement his diet with the V-8 Fusion Pomegranate-Blueberry mix and he loves it, thinking that it's ""Kool-Aid.""  While I realize that this concoction doesn't take the place of the real thing, it will do for now as a aid in his recovery and a means by which he can get some much-needed nutrients.<br /><br />Thanks, V-8.",5
"This ""syrup"" is not very sweet and despite being labelled ""sweetened with splenda"" it has a very small amount as splenda is the last ingredient. The primary sweetner is acsulfame potassium which is nowhere as far as i am concerned. As a general rule if any deception in ingredients or labelling the product should be boycotted. Who wants to buy products from companies that want to deceive you into buying an inferior or cheaply made product. They find it easier to put a token amount of splenda so they can put it on the label and you will think better of the product. I only would buy this if there was no alternative available and it was necessary due to blood sugar level control otherwise pass on it. I hate food companies that lie. Even small lies. It is like a famous brand of shortening on the market that says 0 grams of trans fats on the label but in reality it is 100 percent hydrogenated oil which is trans fat. Even though the entire can is only trans fat they made the serving size so small that it contains less than 1 gram of trans fat so they can put contains 0 grams trans fat on the label to cheat their customers by deception.  Torani sugar free syrup would not sell much if they put sweetened with acsulfame potassium on the front of the bottle instead of splenda. Nuff said.",1
Very good product.  My doctor recomended it and he was right.  It has a different texture than Quaker and a great taste.,4
What can I say............ but that the candy was stale.  This was a real disappointment - as I bought the same product (larger package) in September and it was fresh and perfectly wonderful.,3
"Great shipping, timely.  However, beware of the label (not listed on the Amazon.com ad) that these are very small pill pockets (barely big enough for one little tablet).  They are not the product we thought we were getting ""for capsules"".  It's hard to see that with the information they give you on the web.",3
"I had ordered 3 packages of these back in June.  No problems! ! !<br />Now all of a sudden, they went from less than $12 a package to almost $18 a package.  A bit too steep of an increase for my blood.  I stopped by Wally world earlier on the weekend and they still have them for about half price.  So I grabbed a case for what they want for three envelopes.<br />Guess if your hardup and no way to get to town, go for it - however, if your looking to save a buck and heading out to wally world, wait for it!",3
Was so looking forward to this but FedEx never deliver it so i was very disappointed. Maybe next time i will try again.,1
"I've purchased this product twice.  First time was back in 2007, as a birthday gift for my sister.  She loved it.  She sent me a couple ounces to try and I too thought it was great, maybe the best coffee I have ever tried.  I drink coffee but am by no means a gourmet and I don't buy expensive coffees for my self.  I purchased another order (a couple weeks ago) as a gift for my housemate.  I can't believe its the same coffee.  It tastes like the Folgers or Maxwell House I buy at my local grocery.  It has a bitter aftertaste.  I'll be the first to admit I don't know anything about fancy coffee; but when we opened the package the beans looked wet with oil.  We transferred the beans to other containers and the inside of the package was lined with beans stuck on by the oil.  The beans weren't dripping oil but almost.  Is this right for fancy coffee?  Needless to say I am disappointed.",1
"they call it (primrose) BLACK taffy jack licorice...OK, but it's not black, and it doesn't taste much like licorice.  the pink, black and white wrapping is deceiving, as was the description of the item.  i was lead (maybe by my own wishful thinking) to think these would be similar to the licorice taffy of my childhood.  they were wrapped in black, white and soft pink paper, like the picture, but they were a thin square shape.  this taffy is light brown caramel colored, with a black spot in the middle (licorice?), and dark/hot pink (the color anti-freeze used to be) around one end.  obviously, not at all what i'd hoped for.  a little off, licorice taste...funny/weird after taste.  they were not cheap, so i'll eat the ones i don't give away.  pretty much a disappointment, that i won't reorder.  next time i'll definitely order the claey's licorice hard candy, again.  so much for experimentation...and expanding my horizons.",3
"These chips are good. Not the best thing I've ever tasted, but pretty good. The first couple bites are confusing and strange but it gets better. They get really good after the first ten. I got my box of chips yesterday and I've already eaten two bags. They are yummy. Much better for you than regular chips. I don't feel guilty at all for eating so many. The bags are a little small though. I'm still debating on whether or not twelve small bags of chips are worth $25.",4
"Ordered and received within three days. However, the boxes are set to expire in less than one month. Tasted very odd and I will not order online again.",1

I bought this sea salt grinder a while back at a local super store. The flavor is good and the grinder works well even having a knob to adjust for coarse or fine grind. The knob turns quite a bit so it's not just a two stage choice but allows for a range. Be careful though as I left the bottle too close to the stove one day and the top melted. The grinder cap came off and could not be reattached. I dumped the salt into a container and I use it whenever I need a pinch. The salt is very coarse obviously but works fine for cooking.<br /><br />Overall I like these grinders as they are nice and big and the adjustable grind is a nice touch. Shop around though because Amazon does not have the best price on these and I was able to pick them up for about half this price locally.,4
"This jam is quite tasty and, like many other people who consume it, I choose it rather than a normal type of jam because it is lower in calories. However, I don't deceive myself that it won't raise blood sugar. Yes, this jam is, as the label states, ""sweetened only with fruit juice."" However, any jam which is not made with artificial sweeteners--which this one is not--inevitably derives the vast majority of its calories from some type of sugar. Because of this, the sweetener will appear first in the ingredient list, as is the case with this jam: ""Juice concentrate (pear, grape), raspberries, maltodextrin (dietary fiber), fruit pectin, citric acid, natural flavor.""<br /><br />This product is essentially almost 100% fructose because Polaner has substituted fructose for sucrose as a sweetener and it also is made from whole raspberries. This is a reduced-calorie jam because, since fructose is twice as sweet as sucrose, the producers only need to use half as much of it as they would have of sucrose. Meaning that this jam has about half the calories of regular jam.<br /><br />If you have never had this jam before and are used to regular jam, this jam may taste different to you and initially you may think it isn't quite as sweet. To my own taste, though, since I'm used to eating this brand of fruit spread, it tastes quite sweet enough to me.<br /><br />As stated above, this product contains no artificial sweeteners of any kind. Virtually every artificial sweetener ever sold to the public has been associated with health hazards, including the most serious one of all, cancer, and less serious but quite aggravating problems such as headaches, allergies, brain fog, and digestive problems. This jam also contains no high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) which is currently the principle sweetener in processed foods in the United States. Fructose that occurs naturally in fruit--which is what is used in this jam--is one constituent of a whole food that has many other healthy nutrients within it, such as potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, manganese, and zinc. In contrast, the fructose in HFCS is made from a chemical process. Not only is the fructose stripped entirely from the corn it used to be part of, it now contains unnatural chemicals as well, so nothing healthy remains for the body to utilize to nourish itself. In addition, when HFCS is consumed, it cannot be digested in the small intestines as fructose from fruit can. Instead, the liver has to process HFCS. The liver turns it into triglycerides which cause two main, interrelated health problems. They either are immediately stored by the body as unnecessary fat, leading to obesity, or they clog the arteries, which promotes heart disease and cancer. In addition, digesting HFCS is harmful to the liver, one of the most vital organs in the body.<br /><br />Though this low-cal product has sidestepped those two main issues, I do have a couple of health advisories about it for consumers. First, since the fruit pectin in this product is a standard thickener in jellies and jams and its own natural form of fiber, I am not sure why Polaner opted to add in maltodextrin and call that ""fiber"" too. Anyone with a gluten intolerance should be wary of this product because of the maltodextrin since some people with gluten intolerance are getting sick from the maltodextrin in this jam. The producers claim on the label it is ""gluten-free,"" but maltodextrin can be made from either wheat or corn, and apparently this company is not being careful enough about contamination with gluten.<br /><br />A second problematic ingredient is its ""natural flavor."" It is possible that the producers have added raspberry extract, a chemically derived substance that has a taste similar to real raspberries, in order to get away with using less real raspberries, which are more expensive than flavoring. The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: ""The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional"" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is anything but ""natural,"" and shrouded in purposeful mystery so that the consumer is lulled into believing a product containing it is far more healthy than it actually is.",4
"I guess I'm in the minority here.  I bought a case of these (spent over $41.00) based on the reviews and the fact that I love Sylvia's greens and the Hoppin' John.  Mine, however, are awful.  They are NOT like the ones I grew up eating.  I grew up on a farm in the Deep South and these are nothing like the peas I'm used to, and I know peas, having not only eaten tons of them, but spent years planting, weeding, picking, shelling and freezing them.  These, aside from being a different variety of pea (as you can tell from the can, they are a brownish-red and have an eye), are not flavored well and have a weird, kind of muddy, taste.  But, the worst part is that they aren't even fully cooked!  They are still partially hard and have crunchy bits.  WHAT!!!  Southern peas should be cooked until they are fairly soft.  It makes me wonder if these are prepared from dried peas, another thing Southerners do not do to field peas.  I'm glad the other reviewers are happy with their purchase. Maybe they have changed since then or perhaps the peas they ate in S. Carolina are just radically different from S. Alabama peas (I doubt it.)  In any case, none of my family would ever serve peas that tasted like this, we'd be too ashamed. I am very disappointed (peas and cornbread are my all-time favorite comfort food and still what I request when I visit my parents back on the farm) and angry at the amount of money I've spent on these and I would caution anyone to buy a single can or two somewhere else to try before plunking down this much money on a case.",1

I will keep it and try using it as a flavoring in cooking.",2

No straight sugar, though, so that's a plus. I gave them 3 stars for the small amount of fiber, the recycled packaging and their commitment to quality food. Unfortunately my taste buds clearly swing to a more typical graham cracker.",3

I think it would be okay for dogs that aren't as aggressive though.  My dogs can tear up pretty much anything though! lol",3
"Quaker Chewy Dipps peanut butter bars are a tasty snack that is sure to satisfy anyone who loves the flavors of granola and chocolate. This snack food product takes an ordinary granola bar and coats it with a layer of milk chocolate to create a snack that is more chocolaty and sweeter than the average granola bar.<br /><br />I eat granola bars almost every day and Quaker Dipps are certainly high- ranking in the taste department. Granola with added milk chocolate- who wouldn't love such a combination? However, as much as I love the taste of Quaker Chew Dipps, I cannot overlook some of the negative qualities of these granola bars. First, there are some questionable ingredients such as high fructose corn syrup, cottonseed oil, artificial colors, etc. Other granola bar brands and flavors contain similar less- than- healthy ingredients, but their lists are not as long as the list for Quaker Chew Dipps. The ingredient list for this product includes multiple lines, which cannot be a good thing. Second, these granola bars are quite small. Other granola bars are larger and/or chewier and take more time to eat. These bars are only slightly chewy and their small size makes them disappear in seconds.<br /><br />The added milk chocolate on a Quaker Dipps bar makes them seem like candy bars. And compared to a candy bar, Quaker Chewy Dipps are certainly better. They do contain some wholesome ingredients and actually make a good choice when you have a sweet craving and need a fix. There are many questionable ingredients and the nutritional content is nothing to brag about, but at least you get a little bit of nutritional value and it is still better than that of most candy bars.<br /><br />Granola is a favorite snack food and Quaker Chewy Dipps are a good tasting snack that rate highly based on taste but much lower based on ingredients, nutrition, size, and other factors. I consider them an average snack overall and while I certainly won't turn one away, they include enough negative qualities that I don't seek these out when I shop. They taste great, but the negative qualities mentioned above are enough to make them average overall.",3
Just wanted to warn everyone that this products arrives in bulk inside your average grocery store bulk fruits & vegetables bag.

"As the description says: this is for single-serve ""pod"" type brewers, and it will be quite the pain to use if you're using a Keurig or a Mr. Coffee.

However, at 15 pods to a pack, this a week's worth of coffee if you drink a 15 oz mug every morning, as I do. So, while it is a good coffee when made properly, the value just is not there for me with this product.<br /><br />If you're okay with that, because you see value added by the social marketing related to this product, then go for it.<br /><br />If you're just after good coffee, you can probably get just as good a cup with a different brand for a little less.",3

This version has a maximum distance of about two feet from pods to lights.  I had previously had a great experience growing the herbs.  The tomatoes just needed a lot more headroom that my aerogarden provided.  My harvest was a meager eight (if great-tasting) cherry tomatoes.  I've noticed that since my experience, Aerogarden has introduced a new version with a four foot headroom.  I think the tomato seed kit should be clearly labelled as requiring the four foot version!<br /><br />Also, make certain to read the directions--you'll need to pollinate the tomato flowers by hand, which is a straightforward process that is clearly described.<br /><br />I'm now planting another round of herbs.",2

"I've tried several of Dr. McDougall's products and typically find them tasty. This miso noodle soup however, is pretty nasty. The noodles are ramen, but not GOOD ramen. They are thin, flat, and have a strange aftertaste and texture. The flavor of the soup itself isn't miso, but a bland approximation of it. It tastes more like a watered down salty broth. There isn't much wakame, and a few more tiny chucks of tasteless tofu. This has been sitting in my cupboard for months and will continue to sit there until I run out of absolutely everything else. I'd give it away, but I don't want the recipient to be mad at me when they taste this stuff.",2

"Chicken By-Products, Wheat Gluten, Meat By-Products. NOT FOR MY DOG. The problems with meat by-products are that they may include indigestible or poorly digested parts of the animal (think hair, beaks, hooves, teeth, etc.) and it may include outdated meats from markets. Dogs can handle the outdated meat fine, but the problem is in the packaging. One report I read said that some Styrofoam from meat trays gets inadvertently included with the meat at the dog food factory. It is then very finely ground with the meat, with unknown effects on your pet.<br /><br />Finally, dogs don't digest wheat gluten (a thickening agent). Wheat gluten from China has, in the past, included highly toxic melamine. The source for ingredients isn't on IAMS pet food cans.<br /><br />Sometimes you get far LESS than you pay for.

It's the See's candy of cookies in it's fresh version.<br /><br />1 Star sample:<br />Unfortunately the sample I received for review under the Amazon Vine program did not measure up.  They were clearly old, white filmed chocolate, powdery cookie, most of them had fallen apart and the marshmallow was rubbery.  What a disappointment.

They aren't available everywhere year-round but during the cooler months they make it out to California so they should be available in most decent sized urban areas at least.<br /><br />I've had mixed results with grocery items from Amazon and with a Prime membership and 2nd day air automatic one can only assume that there is a problem in storage or logistics somewhere.

"I'll start with a confession: I make my own margaritas, the basic recipe with lime juice, triple sec, and tequila, plus salt.  That means I'm not expecting other flavors and I'm really not expecting it to be sweet.<br /><br />Take away the alcohol and what's left is lime, and that's what I was expecting when I tasted this.  It's not what I got.  There's lime, of course, plus what seems to be lemon for some reason, but no detectable orange or bitter orange (which would replace the triple sec).  It's fairly sweet.<br /><br />It's also a startling neon green-yellow, a great color for a kids' drink.<br /><br />If you like sweet margarita mixes, this might be for you.  After the kids have gone to bed you can add some tequila and triple sec and make it a bit more interesting, and from there you could throw it into a blender with some ice for a frozen drink.  If your margaritas are lime juice with a kick, you'll probably find this to be too sweet.<br /><br />Update: I mixed this in a bottle with a narrow neck, and left it for a couple of days.  When I poured myself a glass tonight, I noticed a white residue stuck on the bottom of the bottle.

"Did some comparison taste testing and this came out on top.  Organic and great flavor without the caffeine.  No surprise that Amazon is far cheaper than Whole Paycheck (aka Whole Foods) and far cheaper than starbucks Via. You'd think that making instant coffe is intuitive. There is a another counter intuitive way.  Many decades ago a young Greek gentlemen in Athens showed a way to make instant coffee that is still my preferred method.  Maybe because I grew up in London I prefer to boil my water on a stove top over nuking it.  While the water heats mix the instant coffee, granulated sweetener of choice (Splenda for me) and if using a non dairy creamer powder that as well into a thick paste with a little of the water that is heating.  Then when the water achieves a rolling boil pour into the cup and stir.  This method results in a nice foam (creama) on top that just pouring water on the coffee granules and then adding sweetener and creamer will not achieve.  Enjoy.",5

"I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.",4

This coffee does not taste like Colombian to me. It is rather bland and does not taste too much different than any grocery store canned coffee. I was quite disappointed. The cost was quite a bit less than others available which is why I tried it but I will pay more next time to have better quality. The beans look rather dry with little evidence of oil on them and it seems to be a medium roast. I brew my coffee using a Melitta type cone and make each cup as needed. Sorry but I just cant recommend this one.,2
"I (sadly) received these as a ""gift"" from a relative and was severely disgusted at the quality of what I would hardly consider chocolate, let alone food. Trash this on the spot.",1
"You'll love these.  Planters' quality that you'd expect, yet ordering them through the internet is a double-edged sword of a process; less expensive than what you'd probably pay for them in the store, BUT more than likely one or more will be (as was the case here) broken into pieces.  Not a big deal if you're going to share one, but not quite the aesthetic pleasure treat to hand out.  Still, they're sugary and peanuty and . . . well, Planters knows the nut biz!",4
"I bought this ONLY because my grand daughter can not have any dairy at all and they said ""no dairy"" however, the can clearly says it uses dairy. I am ashamed that Amazon is allowing this to be sold and then refuses to accept a return.<br /><br />Now I am stuck with 32.00 plus shipping for soup I could have bought at my local store, you have the chance to save yourself, so I suggest you do not buy this.....",1
It has been up for 3 days now and the yellow jackets just fly past and don't even give it a nod!,2
"This was my 3rd order for these coffee beans. The first two shipments were great. This time I wondered if I was sold an expired 5 pound bag of beans. They lacked the flavour and aroma of the previous two packages. I'm very disappointed.<br /><br />There's a white label on the lower right side on the back of the bag. It has the numbers, 20812.. not sure if that's supposed to mean, 20Aug12. The coffee doesn't appear to be freshly roasted, in any case.",2
"Since recieving my brewer I have been buying all sorts of combo packs and experimenting looking for trhe best flavor for me and was excited to see the Folgers become available as I used to drip brew it, and liked it. Unfortunately I don't, or haven't yet, find the same flavor in the Keurig K Packs. Hmmmmmmm..... what changed?",3
"The combination of real peanuts, chocolate, caramel, and nougat makes for a very satisfying, bite-in-the-bar texture that's a close simulation of a ""real"" candy bar. The flavor, alas, is still a little ""off"", which is why I'm giving it only two stars. While the caramel is excellent and the peanuts give a satisfying crunch, the chocolate and the nougat do not have a distinctive flavor, i.e. if blindfolded and given the chocolate or nougat part of the bar, I would not be able to identify what it was.  The chocolate doesn't taste like ""chocolate"" in other words, but has instead a kind of undifferentiated, artificial sweetener flavor.<br /><br />I actually first wrote a 4-star review for this product, because the texture was so surprisingly satisfying, but after eating 4 bars over the last week I've found it increasingly difficult to stomache the nougat. Thus I've deleted my 4-star review and am replacing it with this one.",2
"I ordered this on 7/30/12. It came on 8/25/12 (not super fast, but not unreasonable coming from India). I wanted to be excited to get this product, but was initially worried about my cardamom because the small cardboard box was very warped and appeared as though it had gotten quite wet at some point. I hoped that the product inside had been packaged in a way that allowed it to remain dry. Boy was I disappointed (I've bought on amazon for years, and this is my very first review. Yep, I'm that unhappy). I cut the tape and looked inside. All of the pods were loose inside the box! They were not contained in any protective covering whatsoever. I removed the pods from the box and did locate a split plastic ziploc bag. Nothing else. It appeared as though it had no hope of keeping my product safe through the shipping process, and not just because of the split in the bag. Nope. It also was completely unsealed. I took pictures but there is no way for me to attach them to this review. The cardamom smelled musty, and I had to throw it away. I was very disappointed. I know accidents can happen, but placing my cardamom into a low quality plastic bag, failing to seal it, and tossing it into a cardboard box just doesn't cut it. This is a poor practice when shipping from so far. I cannot tell if the cardamom would have been fresh otherwise, I will not order again.",1
I am Type II diabetic and it is very difficult to find sweeteners that don't affect my blood sugar and I am very happy with this product.  I contacted the company to confirm it was processed at the low temperatures as they say on the label and they did confirm that and some of  my other questions.  I can put this on top of food like a syrup and I don't get the sugar spikes like I do with the subsequent crashes afterwards.  I do use an American made product (does not use corn or other substances from China) Xylitol from Global Sweet which works well but doesn't offer the versatility of the liquid so I do use both but this works well in baking to right out of the bottle.  I love this product.,5
"I adore Emeril's Bayou Blast seasoning.  I had been getting it locally at Target, but they stopped carrying it.  This is actually cheaper than in the store.  Plus I get 6 bottles of this so I never have to worry about running out again.  Love the flavors in this mix.  Not overly spicy, but incredibly flavorful.  My kids eat it no problem.",5
"I ordered a box based on the reviews and I must say I am somewhat dissapointed. If you enjoy a full flavored medium roast you'll enjoy this one. It has complex flavors and a smooth finish.<br />That said, it's definitely not full bodied or bold in flavor. My favorite k-cups are Coffee People Organic, Newman's Special Blend Organic, Emril's Big Easy Bold and Timothy's Rainforest Espresso. If you like deep bold coffee flavor this one comes up short.",3
"I am one of those people who is not good at drinking water.  I know that it is vitally important to drink plenty of water each and every day, but I have never been one who could make myself drink much of it.  It is because of this that I am always on the lookout for great water beverages and let me tell you, I have had little luck.  Most mix in leave an ick aftertaste because of the fake sugar.  I also greatly dislike carbonated drinks.  When I saw this Essentia product, I was very curious to give it a try.  Through the years, I have tried many different brands of bottled water.  Some have a ""soapy"" taste, some have just a plain weird taste and others are not bad.  Where does Essentia fall into?  I would have to say that it falls into a category that ranks high on my taste bud o meter.<br /><br />The bottle claims that it has a silky smooth taste.  I don't know if I would say that, but it does have a very crisp and fresh taste to it.  I spent the afternoon outside mowing (on a rather hot day) and when I came in, I cracked open the bottle of Essentia.  It was delicious.  Now, of course I was dying of thirst, lol.  An hour later I am nearly finished with the entire bottle! For me, that is amazing, lol.  I am really enjoying the way the water tastes (or lack of taste, whichever the case may be, lol)  I can honestly say that I will hopefully be purchasing more bottles of this in the very near future.  I have not seen it in stores around our area, so will probably order from Amazon.<br /><br />Bottom line, I am incredibly pleased with this water, look forward to enjoying it in the future and highly recommend it!!",4
I never do reviews I read them all the time...<br />But in this case I needed to let buyers know<br />this is not your Mom's Hershey's Syrup........<br />This has a bitter after taste a bitter pill!!!<br />I know it is Sugar Free but really come on it taste like the 1970s sugar free...<br />Hey I bought a 6 pack of it that is how much faith I had that it would be good..<br />Now it sits in my Pantry as I try to figure out which of my friends and family<br />I like least to give it toooooooo...LOL,2
"We do many activities that include our Camelbak drink systems, so we're always looking for something that will make water taste better, especially when it's late on a hot afternoon and the H20 is luke-warm and has that not-so-pleasant plastic aftertaste.<br /><br />When this arrived, I could instantly tell if we did take it on trips, it would definitely be stored in a ziploc baggie, since some liquid had already leaked around the seal. Although the cap closes with a nice snap, it is possible to gently squeeze the sides and have the top pop up. I haven't tested this with elevation changes, but I have a feeling this could be an issue, especially if I'm carrying it in a motorcycle side bag, I'm decently certain the vibration, temperature, and elevation changes would cause a leak.<br /><br />I might still consider using this, but would transfer it to a small Nalgene container (leak proof), since my husband and I both did enjoy the flavor of this Mio Mango Peach over Crystal Lite. We both feel it's a bit less sugary with slightly more ""real"" fruit flavor.",3
"This is an OK product, but I expected more of a sweet ""fresh"" coconut flavor. This product is good, but not great.<br />I liked it, but I did not LOVE it. It just was not yummy.<br />It was kind of bland. Fresh coconut has a naturally sweet taste, this does not. I am not sure if it is lost in the processing. From now on, my coconut will come from the produce stand, so I can continue to enjoy the coconut water, fresh coconut, and toasted coconut in the oven. I guess once you are used to fresh, nothing can compare.<br />I also love coconut oil, and will continue to use coconut oil, but the coconut manna is just lacking something.",4
"I love the Alba products because they contain lots of natural ingredients and are a great value for the price, plus I've always had good resutls with them.  I use the sea kelp products and really like them but decided to try something different for the summer, so I ordered the Jasmine moisturizer and the hibiscus facial toner.  The jasmine cream is wonderful and works great on my dry skin but, unfortunately, the hibiscus facial toner caused severe burning to my skin. After I read the entire ingredient listing, I was shocked to find this toner contains sodium hydroxide which is used in such harsh cleaning products as oven and drain cleaners.  I do have sensitive skin which, I am certain, caused the reaction.  I don't think this product is for sensitive skin, but be sure to read the entire ingredient list before you decide to purchase it, and if possible, try a sample of it first.  I went back to the sea kelp facial toner and have had no further problems.",1
Nice toy. Easy to set up. Keeps my dog occupied sometimes up to an hour he is still not done chewing! Usually by the end of the session he is completely exhausted and falls asleep. However I do have some concerns that the toy is made in China and I am not sure about the health aspect of gnaw hides as some websites don't recommend rawhides as good treats for dogs...,4
"Fun to drink once as a ""just try it"" drink but the herbs get tiring quickly. Not an everyday drink. Needs more juniper to make it a Winter time limited edition, sipping drink. ""Not bad"" is the immediate response but then I want to clean my mouth with a fresh tasting lighter beverage after half a bottle.",2
"Americolor works great.  Unfortunately it's taking more than 2 weeks to get to my house...after my twins 2nd birthday party.  I had to drive across town to buy another set of these colors to do my kids birthday cakes.  Oh well.  I ordered on July 1st.  It's July 16th, and they still haven't arrived yet.  Also, the local shop sold the .75 oz bottles for $1.95.",3
"I absolutely love this bar.  I took it with me when I had to get up early and didn't have time for breakfast.  On the package it says great warmed up, but this bar was just as delicious straight out of the package.  It has great taste, the banana is obviously there but it is not completely overwhelming.  I look forward to trying more flavors, but I have a feeling that this is going to be my favorite because I just really love bananas.",4
Love the aroma and the taste. Orange honey goes great with it. I drink it daily. Seems to work great when I get any stomach issues... would highly recommend this product.,5
"We have 2 cats, one of which started having stomach issues about a month after she traveled eight hours and moved into our house. We thought it might be the stress of the drive, the change to a new habitat and a new cat friend. She was throwing up frequently and also having issues on the other end - I won't get into the gross details. A trip to the vet got her some antibiotics that helped for a short time, but she was back to being miserable, and obviously uncomfortable with using her litter box, not two weeks after seeing the vet. Since we found this food and transitioned her on to it, she hasn't thrown up. Her other issues have cleared up too and she is feeling healthy and happy again. So I'll say it again: thank goodness for this food!!!",5
You can never go wrong with Popchips if you're looking for a healthy AND tasty snack.  The best BBQ chips ever!,5
"Double check the best before date when your chips arrive if you order this item. I was unlucky, I ordered this item in June 2011 and I just noticed (after eating a number of bags of the chips) that the best before date is marked as May 2011, a month before I ordered!!!! I just tossed the rest away, what a waste. I wish I had noticed this when the package arrived, double check the best before date on your order. Seller needs to check the best before date BEFORE shipping",1

"I bought this product after reading all the great health benefits coconut oil offered. I am glad i read it because it provided me with some help with advice on things I can use this oil for. When I got the oil I noticed that it did not smell like coconut, and everything I read stated that the oil should smell like coconut. Now the oil did help to soften my skin and moisturize the places that were really dry, but I just wondered about it since it had absolutely no scent what-so-ever. Also I found that Walmart sales coconut oil that smells like coconut oil and works just as well. So from here on out especially since it is cheaper - it is walmart for me.",3
"Tully's Italian Roast is a full bodied cup of coffee without bitterness.  Great with dessert or after dinner.  Good flavor at mid-size cup or next size up.  Too weak at the largest cup size.  Now, if we just get the price down a bit. . .",4
"I have purchased both the seasoning jar and Kernel Seasons White Cheddar Popcorn already popped in a bag both from Costco.  Both are extremely salty!  The popcorn in a bag has the right cheese flavor but with that comes like half a days intake of salt per serving and you can taste it immensely.  Also when you shake the cheddar seasoning jar onto your own popcorn, to get a good cheese flavor, you have to use quite a bit which adds the taste of quite a bit of salt.  I don't understand why so much salt is necessary.  Furthermore, if you air pop your popcorn and then use the seasoning, the seasoning will not stick to your popcorn.  The popcorn needs to be popped in butter, margarine or oil.  After it is done, while it is still hot and greasy, you have to shake the seasoning on to get it to stick to the popcorn.  My favorite easy to find brand, which is not nearly as salty, is O-kee-dokee popcorn which you can find in chip isle at most grocery stores.  I have tried every brand of white cheddar popcorn out there I can find because I love it so much.  By far, this brand is the king of salt.  Another good easy to find brand which is not as salty as Kernel Seasons is the Quaker brand white cheddar popcorn cakes.  Cape Cod White cheddar popcorn is good as well but is also salty, although not as nearly as salty as Kernel Seasons. Kernel Seasons either needs to reduce the sodium content of their products, or create low sodium alternatives as well, in order to appeal to a bigger market group.",2
This puppy food is not sold locally where I live so Amazon and Wag.com came through with gold star standards! After a fair amount of research online this is the best way to get your puppy food delivered to your door on time or actually 2 days EARLIER than scheduled!!! Great experience!,5
"I tried this mix by myself, then with my family. Both times I couldn't stand the after taste, even though it smelled really good. It was almost tangy or acrid (unpleasantly sharp). My family was in agreement. I ended up throwing the pizza away. The texture was strange, like it was without substance. I definitely would not go with Bob's Red Mill. I love pizza and wish I could enjoy it with my family. I recently came across a pizza recipe with 63 5-star reviews. I'm definitely going to try that one.",1
"Great taste, but not many of the treat clumps shown. It doesn't seem that the boxes got crushed at all, so it might just be the way the cereal is being made. Almost more like crumbs than anything else",3
"I was not expecting the bags to be so small.  I wanted to get replacement bags for the ones that came with my popper, and these turned out to be too small and they are not even remotely lined.  I am constantly spilling popcorn as I am filling the bag and worried that I will have oil stains on my pants from sitting the bags down.  I am not even remotely happy with this purchase.",1
"These sardines are okay, nothing more.  Don't fall for it.  At $2.82 a tin plus shipping, the Bela Sardine from Portugal blows these out of the water.

I bought this because I am trying to drink less soda. This gives you that same soda-ish appeal without all the sugar. In fact it is a little tart so if that doesn't bother you than this is for you. Hope this helps.,3
"I love blue sky products and was very glad to see my favorites offered as zero calorie.  Unfortunately I didn't read the full description.  They use Stevia, the new sugar substitute.  I don't know about the rest of the world but it has a bitter after taste I can't tolerate.  They don't taste bad at first but I am not a fan of that sweetener.  Just FYI.  I don't suppose I can return a case with one can empty so I will save it for guests.",2
"There are quite a few foods I like better than sardines but I eat a tin now and then because they're (supposedly) healthful and very convenient.  I've tried most of the common grocery store varieties and found these to be the best of them, primarily because, as the box says, they are ""meaty portions cleaned and scaled.""  Compared to others, there's less icky bits in the tin, and they do have a nice meaty texture that reminds you more of a real fish meal and less of leftover bait.  The marinara sauce is expectedly watery and flavorless; I add hot sauce or other spices.  Yes, the ad copy all over the box is hyperbolic but presumably you're not buying them for reading material.",4
"I've been buying these for years and my dog loves them. They make a great reward treat and they're easy to carry ... well, they used to be. I got a bag of crumbs this time. What happened to the nice little cubes?

Very disappointed.",1
$59 for 12 k-cups? This is totally ridiculous. Surely this is a typo! Who would pay $5 per k-cup for this or anything else like it?,2
"I picked up this box at Cracker Barrel for my fianc&eacute; since she's never had salt water taffy and it was only about five bucks. Fralinger's is supposed to be one of the best and is still produced in America. Unfortunately half the box consists of two flavors. We had a total of exactly 40 pieces, 12 of which were licorice, 8 chocolate, and the rest still only consisting of 3 or 4 flavors. Given how many different flavors are listed in the guide included in the box, we feel very cheated to have not even received most of them. The ones that are not licorice do taste pretty good and have that great taffy chew, but don't let the box get above about 75 degrees or you'll have a very difficult time separating the taffy from the wrapper.<br /><br />If you like licorice give these a try.",2
"I ordered this product and was thrilled it arrived on Valentines day. DO NOT BUY CHOCOLATE FROM AMAZON! It arrived on time, as a gift, but it arrived MELTED. And, Amazon does not allow you to contact them online about non-returnable items, like chocolate, to express your displeasure over the state it arrives in. I've never had a problem with Amazon before and am VERY VERY Disappointed!",1
"I love the chocolate brownies that i've ordered from this company, but to me - the blondies seem wayyy undercooked.  I know people love brownies moist and chewy, but to me they seem doughy and almost like raw cookie dough.<br /><br />They have candies on them and caramel etc., and i feel they are a good product and company - it's just that i like my blondies cooked longer!  I am going to try to bake one in the oven, altho i know parts of it will melt.",2

"So far I have ordered about 5 boxes of the fruit snacks from Amazon. Two out of three times, I was disappointed with the quality of the product. Once I got the orange flavor that tasted very bitter (like the orange skin was mixed with the juice to make the flavor) and this time, they taste really pale and chewy (kinda like they are not fresh). The packages were shipped fast and the box was sealed so I can only contribute the different taste to the inconsistent quality of the product. Based on this experience this would be my last time ordering the Welch's Fruit Snacks.",3

My boyfriend doesn't mind them, but I just can't stomach them. Worst veg. jerky I've had. Also, the texture is similar to a dry sponge.",2
I have this coffee in the past and really enjoyed it. However this one I received was so weak that neither my sister-in-law or I could drink it. It was left for my mother who likes weak coffee.

I prefer a little stronger, bolder coffee, but at this price, it works for me. There's other brands that I like a little better, but with K-cups, cost per unit is always something I have to factor in...<br />I'd buy it again @ $0.38/cup, but I probably wouldn't @ full price.

"Ok.  So why the one star.  Well Amazon ca canceled my subscription order when I got a good deal on it after I canceled it right after that is.<br /><br />Seems they don't wanna honor it also they deleted the order from my history without notice so I wont have records to back it up.<br /><br />It was for 5.50 or so during the sale after sub and save.  I first bought them for 6.50 or so after s. s.,<br /><br />They deleted it right before the 2nd delivery and me canceling on them for charging me the 8 dollar deal. Why do I want that.  Yep always cancel order on them after getting the first shipment. They wont honor the lower price deals anymore if you get them. Well I did change my cc number so maybe they had a error and just wants an excuse to not honor their contract, who knows.  But dont I would not trust s. s.  There is always a catch in good deals.<br /><br />It's a bait and switch. Obviously like all the retailers. They hate careful consumers.  A knowledgeable consumer is retailers worse nightmare.:P<br /><br />Well same old corporation ways.<br /><br />Anyway Now for the cereal review. Pretty decently healthy and tasty for regular cereals . But like all processed foods the stuff they use is processed so the canola oil/veg oil they use is crap and then extra sugar etc.<br /><br />If you do care then try to buy the natural organic cereals, of course even though they take less work they charge more. lame yes less work more pay because there is less supply.  Well this is great and cheap as long as you just want processed food and is less than 11 cent per oz.<br /><br />Otherwise I'll just get it from my local supermarket since its about the same price when on sale.",1
"These are great for making personal-sized pizza.  However, I don't think they have the qualities of legitimate Naan bread.

"Without a car of our own the small size and light weight of the Incline Scratcher seemed like definite features (as did the price!), so we happily took one home. Our pair of boisterous Bengals enjoyed poking at the paper pom-pom inside, and were intrigued by the scratching surface. But when they tried leaning on it to sharpen their claws it slid right out from under them or tipped over, despite being braced in a corner of the room. That was enough for SisterCat - she wasn't interested in going near it again, no matter how much we coaxed or cajoled.<br /><br />We tried weighing it down firmly, and BrotherCat gave it another go... at which point his claws caught in the cardboard and he ended up pulling the entire scratching-pad out from the main structure. That was it for him. We've kept it around just in case, but it's just been gathering dust - neither cat showed any interest again.<br /><br />We ended up with an Armarkat Cat Tree, and a scratching mat. Both do a far better job of standing up to the energetic feline pair and their antics.<br /><br />I do like the concept of the Incline Scratcher - it's clever, environmentally-friendly and affordable - though I can see it leading to cardboard scraps all over the floor if it's actually used. It might be good for kittens or small cats - I'll probably donate it to kitten rescue or the like.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though, this product is just not up to the force a largish, active cat can apply.",2

"The vet showed me that my 14-year-old cat's teeth and gums were in bad shape. Her teeth were stained and layered with plaque. Her guns were bright red along the edges. She had Gingivitis. I was facing a $300+ teeth cleaning bill for the cat. The vet recommended I try Hill's Dental Diet first. After two months of eating it, the cat returned to the vet. The large, hard nuggets had cleaned the plaque from her teeth. Her gums were no longer red, but pink and healthy. Hill's did what was needed. I am thrilled with the results.<br /><br />Yes, this food is expensive, but so is a teeth cleaning bill for a cat, as well as dental problems if you don't. Once my cat's mouth improved, I cut back on the Hill's. I feed my cat a main diet of Purina dry, but I still give her 8-10 Hill's nuggets a day. She's been on this mixed diet for one year and her teeth and gums are still good and healthy. The Hill's large nuggets act like a tooth brush that scrapes against the cat's teeth.<br /><br />Pound per pound this cat food is actually less expensive than those little bags of tarter control cat treats you buy in the supermarket. Once you get control over your cat's dental problems you can maintain her by giving her several Hill's Dental Diet nuggets a day. If your cat has no problems yet, consider giving her a small handful of Hill's Dental nuggets to ward off any future problems. This stuff works!",5
"I really wanted to like this, as it was organic, and came in a glass bottle, but there was hardly any flavor at all. I could barely smell it, and even when I poured a generous amount on my dish, it imparts little to no truffle flavor/aroma. My truffle salt is much more potent.",2
"The box says pack of 24 but I only received 23 in the box. I recounted it 4 times. It really ticks me off because of the lack of professionalism in packaging. Worst part, I can't find a way to get my money back or get in contact with them to state my case. It's only 1 missing slim jim so it's not a big deal, I hate being lied to and ripped off. This also makes me wonder, are all the boxes only containing 23 but states 24? That's false advertisement. Regardless, not satisfied and wouldn't buy again.",1
I would not recommend this product. The first one that arrived was returned because it was spoiled. The packing material was bubble wrap with two ice packs inside of an insulated bag. The second one arrived and I decided not to use it as well because it was lukewarm and I was afraid of getting sick. Shocking how it was packaged!,1
"On the whole, Medifast foods are fairly tasty.  These eggs (all their eggs) are just awful.  I tried them cooked and seasoned every which way, and could never force down more than a forkful.  I threw out the rest of the box.  If it's a breakfast food you crave first thing in the morning, stick with the pancakes, or oatmeal.  They are much, much, better",1
"Yes I have eaten organics before, the brown color has no effect on me whatsoever........... but, these taste more like big fluffy raisins, not apricots.  There's a hint of 'cot, but there is more 'cot in Apricot Pyramid Beer than these.  That said, they are what they are and they are great for regularity and great to send as gifts - dried California organic fruit.<br /><br />I should say I am used to slab 'cots from casa de fruta, and these do not resemble in any way those dried 'cots even though they use sulfur dioxide, they are juicier and sweeter and taste like apricots.  Even Casa de Fruta's basic 'cots taste better than these.  I ordered on subscription, but will cancel today and have at least 4-6 gifts for Christmas already.",3
"First, I will say up front that I purchased these chocolates off of the Lindt site itself in a 21-piece ballotin ($12 there) because I had a coupon/deal voucher.<br /><br />I am not a fan of Lindor truffles, but I have a friend who loves these petit desserts. So, I figured I'd give them a try!<br /><br />First impression - Adorable! If you're looking for dinner party chocolates, these would be lovely.<br /><br />Texture - The chocolate still is a tad waxy, but not nearly as bad as the Lindor truffles. The fillings are smooth and taste similar to the desserts that each chocolate resembles. There are different textures - different than what you'd find in typical chocolate boxes. Crunchy nuts, crispy meringue and phyllo-ish substance, and creamy creme brulee and lemon.<br /><br />Taste - Each chocolate has a unique taste, but not so unique as to not be enjoyed one after another...so, be careful ;)<br />Each chocolate tastes somewhat like the dessert.<br /><br />Overall - They aren't Godiva, but they're the next best name brand thing I've found!",4
Awful!  not coffee this is instant coffee and bad instant coffee at that.  Do not be tempted by the price-not worth a penny.,1
"There are times when I crave a bowl of ramen. For those of us who do not have access to local stores with less expensive stock available, this is the next best thing. My order arrived well packed and in good condition. I deducted a star for Amazon's price-it could be lower, but they sell at what the market will bear.",4
"First, I have to say that when I got this product, my kids were quite excited.  They love anything with cheese in it so that was a plus from the beginning.  The directions are easy and you can substitute different meats for the chicken breast, which--besides 2 1/2 cups of water--is the only thing not included in the box.  I used ground turkey since I didn't have any chicken breast on-hand.  I'm sure that ground beef, pork or cubed thigh meat would work just as well.  One recommendation:  Stick to the instructions to the tee.  When they say ""simmer & stir often"", they mean very often.  The pasta sticks to the pan if you do not stir it often enough.  I stirred about every 45 seconds to 1 minute during the first 7-minute cooking time and just barely caught the pasta from sticking too much to the pan.  The reason I placed broccoli in quotations in the title is that the teeny-tiny packet of freeze-dried broccoli once placed in the dish near the end of the cooking time becomes pretty much non-existent.  It is hard to see and it does not have that lovely green look like it does in the picture.  I'd really just call it the Cheesy Chicken Skillet dinner and not even include the broccoli.<br />Flavor was decent, although a little salty if you eat more than a servings-worth.  The kids loved it, of course...it's CHEESY!  It wasn't bad for my taste buds either.  I was thinking that if I make this again, I might just add my own fresh broccoli florets near the end instead of the freeze-dried packet.<br />The Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit was a hit with the kids...I'd just leave the word ""broccoli"" out of it.",4
"$15 for 24 servings??  that is crazy, especially that you can get green teas in a box cost a few bucks.  Also, the plastic cups go in landfill.  i will never buy these cups again.",1
"Organic compounds contain carbon. Salt- sodium chloride, NaCl- is inorganic.<br /><br />Even using the silly redefinition of ""organic"" which took over six years ago, it makes no sense to ask whether salt was ""organically grown"" -- it's a mineral, for pete's sake! Of course it's not genetically engineered etc. The USDA grudgingly started dealing with ""organic"" certifications for plants and livestock, but they won't touch claims of ""organic salt."" Only three organizations (one in France, one in NZ, and one in Wales) with dubious credentials have tried to buy into the ""organic"" craze by certifying ""organic"" salt.<br /><br />Nothing against this salt- I'm sure it's fine. But any other natural sea salt will be just as good. Don't pay extra for a meaningless label.",3
"This granola was not crunchy or clumpy enough to use as my family's go to granola, but I can use it as an ingredient for other baked goods.  Plus I didn't like that it wasn't organic.",2
Natural Balances price continues to increase while their bag size and product continues to decrease. I am tired of rewarding Natural Balance because they cant hedge commodity prices. Anyone have an suggestions on what dog food they switched to?,1
"This cornbread mix came packaged well, but each package was open at the side seam. Not sure when it happened, either at the store, or in shipment. But we cannot use it. Cannot return it, as I opened the package to see if we could salvage any. I guess nothing we can do but never order it again.",1
"I picked this up at my local store and after brewing poured it out right away. The first thing you taste is bad fish, then a berry taste. It was so gross. I read the label and tuna oil is how they get the Omega 3. I should have picked up a pomegranate flavor with out the omega 3. I wrote an email to Bigelow since my satisfaction was not met. I will see if I get a response. Disgusting, I had to brew something else to get the taste out. Learned my lesson- fish oil does not go in tea!",1
"First they changed from 4 boxes to 3 and charged more, then they lowered the price again to maintain the customers, now they have DOUBLED the price again!!<br /><br />I just imagine how people would react if another type of subscription went up to double price from time to time, and you only realize it when it arrives in your mailbox.<br /><br />It's not the product that is in question, it's the marketing",1
"After my dog smelled this treat lke 3 times, he finally ate it and now he really likes it! Its really great, I love that I know its healthy and not bad for my dog! It has a slit in the middle so you can break it in half, making it 650 treats(somewhere around that number)...its a great deal! I love to give it to my dog after he goes on a walk(like a little reward but its perfect because its not fattening (hes overweight!)",5
"I got these a few weeks ago and have to Say Haribro did it again!!! Well Almost...What where they thinking adding Green Apple? just doesn't taste good at all...Granted some may like it, but my entire family and a group of friends who tried them all said the same thing...the Apple stinks...As far as all the other flavors...AWESOME!!!",4
"My wife and 15 year-old daughter don't drink coffee and are envious of my access to fresh coffee in my Keurig, one-cup-at a-time machine..  They do, however, love hot chocolate/hot cocoa.  The three of us were trying to decide which of many available boxes of Keurig compatible hot chocolate to order.  None seemed to have universally positive reviews, and most cost about a dollar per K-cup, which seems expensive for one home made mug.  We didn't want to make a mistake and buy 16, 32, or more, of a brand or type they didn't like.<br /><br />Voila!  Someone thoughtfully put nine varieties of hot chocolate in one box,  The ""Keurig K-Cups Chocolate Lovers Sampler Pack + Limited Edition Print."" Plus, it included thirty-five cups of hot chocolate, and for under a dollar a cup.<br /><br />The Chocolate Lovers Sampler Pack arrived yesterday.  Tonight, the three of us enthusiastically ripped into the box containing nine different versions of hot chocolate/hot cocoa.  We even moved the Keurig machine from the kitchen to the family room for easier access as we watched TV and simultaneously  engaged in a chocolate lovers orgy, an orgy which I agreed to join.  Following a directive from my daughter, I made a special run to buy marshmellows.<br /><br />If we each had three cups of different hot chocolate, and traded sips, we would each have tasted all nine permutations of the Chocolate Lover's Sampler Pack, and know which of the nine were our favorites.<br /><br />My first cup was, ah... dissappointing.  It tasted a little like coffee, not hot chocolate, but was so weak I couldn't be sure.  My wife and daughter, were soon, ""yucking"" with disgust.  They both hate coffee, and I joined them in my evaluation of this coffee.  We tried container after container, and the result was repeated, over and over.  The K-cups fell into one of two categories:  weak bad coffee; or weaker bad coffee.  I couldn't discern more nuance than that.  I tried making a cup setting the water quantity for a tea cup.  Nope.  Still too weak.  (And I have many Keurig coffee's that I love.  They often have the word ""bold"" in the title, and I apparently do like strong coffee.  I'm not saying everyone will dislike these particular K-cups, only that I sure did, and doubly so since we had ordered a Sampler Pack of hot chocolate and hot cocoa.<br /><br />Finally, my daughter found one Green Mountain Hot Chocolate, and it was pretty good, but watery.  She found another and after reducing the water quantity down to the tea cup size, with a couple of marshmellows tossed in, that one cup was good.  One cup of hot chocolate out of 35 cups.  Some chocolate lover's orgy. :-(<br /><br />I considered the possibility that perhaps I'm partially to blame.  Maybe the item description said that this was really weak, bad coffee, and not hot chocolate at all.<br /><br />But the Chocolate Lover's Sampler is the 11th hit in a search of the, ""Grocery and Gourmet Food,"" category using, ""Keurig hot chocolate,"" as the search phrase.  There are 24 items on this first page alone, and three additional pages of hits follow.  Hit number 21, for example, is, ""Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa Milk Chocolate, 12-Count K-Cups.""  The Chocolate Lover's Sampler is surrounded by Hot Chocolate.<br /><br />I've been buying items from Amazon since they were just a little stream, with some interesting rapids, not unlike the nearby Chatooga River which marks the Georgia/South Carolina border, and where the movie, ""Deliverance,"" was filmed.  In all that time I have never given an item one star.  I usually only write reviews if I have had a five star experience.  So I gave it two, although one (1) would have been fully justified.<br /><br />Now, how do I get my money back, or a credit on some real hot chocolate?<br /><br />UPDATE:  THREE DAYS LATER.  Yesterday I explained our experience on the official feedback form, and referenced this review for more detail.  I asked for a refund of 5/6s of the purchase price.  This morning, less than 24 hours after describing my experience, this amount had been credited to my credit card.  While it's debatable whether this product deserves a rating as low as two stars based on the fact it doesn't contain the product I thought I was getting - it could be perfect for someone who wants a variety of flavored coffees - IMO, one thing is not debatable:<br /><br />Amazon's customer service is five stars, plus, and I offer that evaluation based on over a hundred purchases, ranging from a $5 HDMI cable, to a $34,027 Volvo XC Station Wagon*, stickered at $40,650.  And, I was able to avoid almost $2,400 in sales tax.  But get this, the young man who delivered this beauty insisted on washing it in my driveway, and refused to accept even a modest tip.  I hope this doesn't get him fired, but he did accept a freshly brewed, delicious cup of Keurig coffee (I had one, too) made with the Parisian Extra-Bold Dark Magic K-cup.)*<br /><br />* Just kidding.  I've purchased some expensive items but no car.  Yet.  But I'm not kidding about Amazon service:  Five Stars.",2
"At 48 dollars for 12, it's highway robbery. Doing the math, that comes out to 4 dollars a box. Each box has four envelopes, that means a doller per envelope. You can go to Drugstore.com and get it for half that price. Not to mention I can buy individual boxes, I don't have buy in bulk.",1
"First off , It leave a bad taste in our mouth. Next Dose not taste like any thing I ever had .and last it made us sick later that night .<br />there's no use by date on it so it makes one wounder if it is out dated",1
"These chocolate truffles were on a wonderful sale, and I love chocolate and could not resist.  There was a bountiful number of dark chocolate 'kisses' coated with cocoa, and though I ordered them in October, I still have plenty left, and that's after sharing a pretty good sized baggie with a friend.<br /><br />However, I only give it 3 stars because it's not by any means the best chocolate.  I would have been very disappointed if I had paid full price for them.  However, at the bargain price I paid, they are just fine, and very nice to let melt in the mouth while sipping good coffee.",3
"I have a 70 lb lab/hound mix who loves to chew, so I always buy her the Nylabone Durachew toys. This is my first time buying this one for her and it arrived today. She's had it for about 4 hours and is already destroying it and I literally just saw her eating pieces of it as I'm typing this. It's going in the trash. Summary: My dog absolutely loves it and I don't. I should have ordered her another Galileo; it might shed little white flecks on the floor or injure my children when she flings it across the floor, but it's a lot more durable and safer for her to chew on than this one (and she loves it).",2
"The first thing I noticed was an almost chemical-like smell upon opening the bottle.  It did NOT smell like spices.  I had my sister take a whiff for a second opinion and she said it smelled like chemicals from the hair salon.  Not a good start.  Perhaps the cheap plastic bottle it's packaged in was affecting the smell?  Despite the scent, I tried the curry powder. There's definitely a kick from the Red chiles which are the first listed ingredient.  Other than that, the overall taste is just odd.  It does not taste like any curry powder I've ever had, hot or otherwise.  The ingredients listed on the label are: Red Chiles, Coriander, Yellow Mustard, Fenugreek, Tumeric, and Cayenne.  (At the time I'm writing this review, the ingredients were not listed on the product page.)<br /><br />One more small oddity.  Although the label is in English, there must have been a translation somewhere along the way because it includes these instructions: ""Curry powder must be heated up, in a little butter before use.""  Huh?<br /><br />If you want good, quality Curry Powder this sadly isn't it.",2
"These are pretty fantastic for from a mix pancakes. If you follow the instructions from the package to make them they're kinda so-so, but if you substitute 1/2 a cup of yogurt and enough liquid to thin the the batter to the proper consistency for the milk that it asks for you get a really fluffy and pleasantly sweet pancake. Without the addition of the acid from the yogurt they taste a little too much like baking soda and don't rise very well.<br />I suspect one could use orange juice to the same effect if you were avoiding dairy/soy/nut liquids.",4
"The first time I ordered this product, I just let it go and decided it was a fluke when my containers arrived smashed and broken open.  Now it has happened again!!!  On my first shipment, I also had containers that looked ok, but were obviously open/spoiled after tasting (argh!)",1
My cat loves the food and is doing very well on it.  It was delivered almost immediately.  I am very pleased. It's tough finding food good for kidney cats will eat.,5
"I've been buying this line of products for years.  We have pugs and they don't do well with large hard treats.  These are perfect.  They are soft and very small so it's not an issue giving multiple ""cookies"" as they are low in calories.  And of course the dogs love them.",5
"If it had not been for the mango chutney, this would have been a  total washout. The mustards were too sweet and the hot pepper relish was not really hot.",2
"I contacted the company regarding their claim that the product is:<br /><br />""All Natural"" and has ""No Artificial Anything"".<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found these statements to be no more than marketing hype, as the product is not non-GMO.  Even when the Funley's marketing person responded to my query, he re-stated the claims above, then stated that the product is, in fact, not non-GMO.<br /><br />It is arrogant to assume a consumer's memory is only a sentence long--that we aren't ""smart"" enough to understand that two statements in a short email are contradictory.  Funley's is another company that has abandoned honesty in favor of trickery in marketing.  While the product may be tasty, the marketing is distasteful and dishonest.  There is nothing natural about GMO ingredients; it's common sense.<br /><br />If you are not aware of the problems with Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO), such as preponderance of soy and corn on the market, please visit your favorite search engine and get started!

"The pear, pea, and green bean flavor is not a winner in our house.  My 13 month old spit out the first taste. I've tried it several times with her, even chilled from the fridge. But she doesn't like it. I tasted it and the pea flavor is prominent.",2
"Unless you read the fine print, you won't know that ""Turkey & Chicken Formula"" actually contains turkey, chicken AND whitefish.  Upon opening a can, you immediately get a hint of something fishy--perhaps this is why others have reported the food as ""contaminated"".  After just a single 5.5 oz can, my dog had a serious case of fish breath and by the next day was occasionally passing fishy-smelling gas.  Don't get me wrong---my dog loved this food, and I have read enough reviews to be satisfied that it's very good quality.  I have no doubt he would love to gobble down more of this (and I've got another 23 cans to get through), but I don't think my family will appreciate more of the fishy smell.",3
"I bought this on Amazon to be able to get it in the 4 pack for a great price.  It's not really different from any other Curacao and can be used along with other ingredients to make alcoholic, or non-alcoholic drinks.  It's a sweet syrup with a slight orange flavor.",5
"Even though it says it's a medium roast, it's more mild and weak flavored. Would definitely have to use more pods to get better flavor. My son also tried it and used 2 pods for a 16 oz to go cup. He agreed it was weak but also commented that it had an odd flavor note to it.",3
"Wrongful advertisement! I usually don't write any reviews but I had to give this one a star. Ever since I gave my 6 month old this organic oatmeal cereal (which she seemed to like with my breast milk) she has been constipated. Day no 4 and I am still waiting for her ""full diaper""! I can see how much she is suffering trying to poop, I tried prunes and this product is still sitting in her little tummy. Waste of money! Disappointed in whole foods that they would sell such a bad product!",1
"One of the things that you do when you have to go gluten-free is utter a prayer before each new foodstuff:  ""Please God, let it not taste weird.""<br /><br />And these?  Seriously?<br /><br />They taste like crunchy licorice.  They even leave a licorice aftertaste.  Unless you are a non-taster, or you like unsweetened licorice, these are bad crackers. Children might use them to build forts, perhaps.<br /><br />However, the other Glutino crackers in this line are good.",2
"I bought the lapsang souchong & the sechung oolong tea from COFFEE BEAN DIRECT and was absolutely thrilled with them both. Great value. super fast shopping. But above that the tea is excellent. The oolong is delicate and beautiful. the lapsang is strong and vibrant. I'm looking forward to ordering more just as soon as i get more room. 2 pounds of tea is a lot. As to the nay sayers who did not like this company's tea I say ""rubbish"" this tea is fantastic. ESPECIALLY at the price. What world do you live in that you can gourmet tea for around a dollar an ounce? These are perfect workaday teas. I do not not want  a tea that the price makes me wince when  I make a cuppa. So in summation brilliant teas from one of my new favorite tea houses.",4
"This is an interesting BBQ sauce, though not close to a Thai peanut sauce. It is rather thin as well but it otherwise cooks well on chicken if you layer it on as you grill. The shipping was rather high considering the size.",3

"Dulse is a great snack. There are almost no calories, loads of flavor, and a ton of potassium. Believe it or not, this is a low-sodium treat too. The flavor is something you like, or don't. If you do? Dulse is a great snack and even 'spice' for soups and such!",5
My wife and I retired to Panama last year and we haven't been able to find Friskies Party Mix at any of the stores here  We tried other cat treats but the cats just stuck up their noses and walked away.  Now I have to send away for Party Mix to make the cats happy.  I just wish there would be a box with all the choices mixed in.,3

"Deeply disappointing. Somehow the bars are chewy where they should be crispy, and almost crisp where they should be chewy. Overall they are bland, and taste vaguely of oil, sugar and chocolate chips without satisfying.<br />I will never buy these again.",1
"It seems to work, not sure if it is my pump working good to keep up my milk supply or the fenugreek but it definitely makes my milk smell sweeter.",4
"It is a wonderful product. Very difficult to find, brings out the flavor of veggies.",4
"I ordered the new packaging on this product and received the old packaging. The discs in this packaging are defective which I suppose is why they changed it. Many of the discs  in the brown packaging have caused problems as did the first disc out of this package. Last time I contacted Maxwell House to complain and they said they would ship me a replacement, never did. And here we go again. I am not happy with this product.",3
"The flavor of both the lemon and ginger cookies is good, and if the texture of these cookies could be improved, I might even buy them again.  The texture was grainy and distracting.  I'll try the tip about refrigerating them for the two dozen I purchased.  Maybe a better mixture of flours rather than the predominate rice flour in this cookie would help eliminate the grainy texture.",1
"I'm a fan of spice. It's almost a problem, in that I put hot sauce and/or seasoning on almost everything I eat lately. It's not uncommon for me to have a mean sweat going on while I eat. Yeah, some people would probably find that weird or even crazy... but for me, I enjoy it. I love spicy food.<br /><br />Which brings me to the review. I bought this 4 pack of Da Bomb ghost pepper sauce looking for a kick similar to what I experienced with the Dave's Gourmet Ghost Pepper sauce. But it's not. It's nowhere near the intensity as the Dave's sauce. In fact, Da Bomb's sauce is mostly habanero based, according to the ingredients. Habanero usually has a kick, but this sauce is no spicier than the habanero hot sauce I can get for a buck per bottle at my local grocer. I feel like I basically paid a premium for a sauce because they call it ""ghost pepper"", even though it has ghost pepper listed as the last ingredient in the list. Lame.<br /><br />Taste wise, it's ok. Spice wise, it's mild for me... particularly when compared to competing brands. With Dave's, I'd put a couple of drops on my food and the level of heat was fantastic. With Da Bomb, I'm dumping this stuff on my food and adding some habanero powder on top to give me my fix.<br /><br />Bottom line -- if you're looking for a really tasty, spicy hot sauce, this probably isn't for you. If you're serious about spice, try the Dave's Gourmet sauce. Amazon doesn't always carry it, but it's worth hunting down. Just don't waste your time with this.",2

"We added our chicken and fixed this for dinner.  It was very good.  We don't do pre=packaged food like this very often, but now and then we just need something quick, and a meal like this works fine.",4
Was a nice combo of flavors. The chocolate and salt were a good ratio.  I did enjoy it and would likely buy one.,4
"I love this cheese.  However, it is far to expensive.  I found I can have my local store get Mizithra Cheese for me at about a quarter of the cost of ordering it here.",3
"I like this blend very well, its the next best thing to my favorite. Dark Magic isn't as strong as the name suggests but compared to Jet Fuel and wake up call this is the strongest.  If money is no object, consider plugging Kona Coffee into Google, then select a seller and order Peaberry Kona. At about $17.00 for 8 oz its the most expensive available.  But I absolutely frigging guarantee it'll be the best, richest and most satisfying cup of coffee you've ever had.",4
"These are great tasting, good quality cookies. But, they are packaged in cheap paper bags which offer no protection from damage. No matter where you buy them, you will most likely receive a bag full of broken cookies and crumbs.<br /><br />Campbell's Soup is the parent company of Pepperidge Farm and I have complained to them about their inadequate packaging many times and rather than improving the packaging, they just asked me to stop calling. Pepperidge Farm promised to send vouchers/coupons for replacement of the damaged cookies, but they never delivered on their promise. I was just told, ""Don't call here anymore.""",3
"I love this brand. If you go to their website, sign up for their newsletters. They'll send you $3.00 off coupons every couple of months or so. No so helpful when purchasing through amazon but helpful if you have a local store with Amazon similar pricing like I do ;)<br /><br />My dog loves this food. He suffered from some stomach problems when he was a puppy so I switched him to Innova. I loved Innova, but my puppy didn't - his hair became oily, he didn't seem interested in the food, he began to smell bad, and the stomach issues continued. I did more research, switched to Wellness, and everything cleared up! I like the clean ingredients, the way his coat looks, and how he NEVER has bad breath or puppy farts. Ever.",5
I have bought sticky traps like this before and though they don't seem to catch hoards of the little buggers there are at least a few in there. After two weeks of seeing a cloth moth or two flying around my closet every time I go in there the trap still has not one moth in it. Maybe the attractant or sticky was too old on this batch.,1
"The granola was alright and tasted good.  My issue with it was that it was very hard to chew.  I couldn't eat much before my jaw was exhausted.  It was so terrible because I was so excited about cinnamon, almond, cocoa granola - I found it addictive but it wore out my face!",4
My daughter loves this tea and so I purchased it here.<br />It is less expensive than the other sellers.,3
"Thought I was doing a good thing for my doxie mix by getting one of the better brands as listed on dogfoodanalysis but boy was I mistaken.

It may be great for some dogs, just didn't work for mine.",1
"This item has some limited positives, as follows:<br /><br />+ Edible.<br />+ Refrigeration not necessary, so good for emergency preparation.<br />+ Decent shelf life of more than a year.<br />+ Could be eaten without heating, if necessary.<br />+ Relatively low (310) calories, though not a significant amount of food, either.<br />+ Cooks in 90 seconds.<br /><br />I would classify this as satisfactory for emergency kits, alongside the cardboard-flavored granola bars, but little else.<br /><br />The item doesn't have very many negatives, but they're hard to overcome. The first is an extremely high sodium content. People are going nuts over sodium these days, which is ridiculous. However, one of these contains as much as half of the suggested daily sodium intake. That's a lot for such a small item.<br /><br />Most disappointing, is the flavor. Actually, that's inaccurate. Complaining about the flavor suggests that there is any. If instant mashed potatoes made from flakes with water and no milk or butter or salt was rated as a five on the flavor intensity scale, where ten is the most intense flavor you've ever experienced, I would rate this meatloaf and mashed potatoes as a one.<br /><br />There is no difference between the potatoes and the meat. They share the same flavor (or lack thereof) and nearly the same texture. Only the color gives you any suggestion that there are two different items of food in the container. The gravy is no better. It's brown and tastes . . . well, it has no flavor, either. A brown crayon would be more flavorful.<br /><br />I have never been in the military, but I suspect this is very similar to MREs. Actually, for the sake of those in the military, I have to believe that MREs are not this bland.",2
"If you like lemon you will love ""I Love Lemon""!  I have been drinking this tea for years and have never lost my taste for it.  If you make a second cup of tea from the same tea bag it has a more lemony flavor as the Rose Hips dissolved out in the first cup.  Two different teas in the same tea bag!!!",5
"Normally, if it's got the word ""gourmet"" in it, my back stiffens up. It's a label often slapped onto an over priced product to attract the those that will eat/drink anything with the word on ""gourmet"" because they think it makes them look cool and hip. And it usually doesn't taste what I would consider ""gourmet."" So, I confess, I started reviewing this with a bias against it - high price and labeled ""gourmet"".<br /><br />With only a ""one pot"" sample to work with, I didn't have a chance to try differing brewing methods. I went with my typical coffee making method, drip brew. It smelled nice, looked pretty dark. The taste is very hard to explain. While it has a full flavor, that flavor is of...weak coffee. I thought I'd botched the brew, but when I compared the color and opacity against my normal stuff, the Puroast looked identical. It just tasted like the same near see through stuff one gets at a greasy spoon restaurant, gas station,IHOP, etc. While not vile, it wasn't for me. I prefer a darker, richer taste.<br /><br />That being said, the big deal about Puroast is that it's low acid. That I will say I definitely noticed. Not even a hint of tummy twisting, even though I intentionally drank it on an empty stomach. For those that have problems with acid, and don't mind (or maybe even like) the taste of weak coffee, it's worth a try at least. Given the price, I'd suggest you get as little as possible to try though.",3
"I do not have a huge amount of espresso bean experience.  I've been grinding my own beans for drip coffee for many years, but just started my home espresso operation.  Compared to some other beans I've tried, the Lavazza beans were distinctly less oily.  There's a bit of ""chaff"" or ""husk"" during the grinding process.  This may be perfectly normal, but I was more accustomed to oily beans that maintained a bit of heaviness.<br /><br />The flavor is good and balanced, although not at all aggressive or robust.  (This could have something to do with my process, I really can't speak to that.)<br />Pulling a double to make caps or macchiatos, the flavor is very satisfying.  However, the additional milk in a latte bumps the need to at least a triple shot.<br /><br />No burnt flavor at all.  Crema is easy and consistent.",3
"I like to keep a few of these in my car in the cool weather so I have something for when I get hungry on the way home.  These really Good bars for when you are starved and dont have anything handy. You could cut this in half if you wanted to and have 2 decent size pieces out of it! I bought 1 at the store first to see if I liked them and paid lots more for it. I don't eat alot of meat so this caught my eye. I dont recommend any auto delivery though because if you want to stop, you can not without a hassle.",4
"I would love these suckers if they didn't use acesulfame potassium, or Acesulfame K, as a main ingredient. In various rat studies, Acesulfame K produced lung tumors, mammary tumors, and rare types of tumors in other organs (such as the thymus gland), several forms of leukemia and chronic respiratory disease, even when less than maximum doses were given. According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, it was petitioned on August 29, l988 for a stay of approval by the FDA because of ""significant doubt"" about its safety.<br /><br />They taste great, but frankily, I'm afraid to eat them. Why not use Stevia instead?",3
"This raspberry tea from Ahmad's of England, makes an acceptable cup of tea. However, the flavoring was a bit weak for my taste. A couple of reviewers referenced the raspberry flavor as strong and/or tart, whilst I found it to be neither. I would call this a medium-bodied black tea, with a rather light, red raspberry flavor. Fortunately, I found that a bit of sugar really helped to enhance the flavor. No adverse aftertastes were detected. It's four o'clock somewhere...tea time, anyone?",3
"This is the very first time I have received merchandise that has been crushed, including the outside box.  What is more important is the fact that this is food--so I felt Amazon should know.  Unfortunately your website does not allow JPEGs to show you the damage.",2
Have tried a number of this kind of dry packaged raviolis. This was one of the worst (and there are a couple I like a lot). Filling tastes bad -- when you can notice the filling. Can't use it with a butter or Alfredo sauce; they don't cover up bad taste..,1
The Savu Bags were simple to use and gave our meat a super smoked flavor.  Made cleanup easy and quick.,4
"Tried rooibos tea recently and loved it. Nearly drank my parents' entire supply while I was visiting over the holidays (sorry mom and dad)! So far locally this Madagascar Vanilla Red is the only rooibos tea I could find. Well I'm sorry to say I'll have to keep looking. I'm even sorrier I bought two boxes. Not only is there no rooibos taste, there is no vanilla taste, and in fact not much of a taste at all. Celestial Seasonings is my brand of choice, but they have disappointed here.",1
"If you like sweet and like chocolate, then you should like the taste of these. The main ingredient is sugar, so these are very sweet. They are also very crumbly, and only 9 cookies in each box, so they are expensive (and a box is only 5.29 oz). But because they are so tasty and 89% organic I'm giving them an overall 4 star rating.",4
"They are delicious, yes, but I'm confused how a relatively small bar packing this much fat can be called ""healthy.""  And they sure don't tell you about it in their description!",3
"When I first noticed that the sample box of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E"">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler</a> (provided to me by the manufacturer for review) contained ""Himalayan Sea Salt"", I thought that it was a very odd choice for a jelly bean flavor, but it turned out to be surprisingly enjoyable. My family enjoys different sea salts, so we were familiar with the taste before getting them in this jelly bean form, and can say that these are spot on. While not a flavor everyone is going to enjoy, the more adventurous may want to give these a try.<br /><br />I also really like that these jelly beans are made with natural flavors and colors.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH",4
I had these cookies in a restaurant. Loved them so I got the name and ordered them. Not the same quality is terrible. They had a funny taste and they were a waste of money.,1

"Awesome, probably THE best coffee in the world, no exaggeration!  Very smooth, not bitter, can make it strong and it doesn't taste too ""Starbucky"".  Can you tell I don't prefer Starbuck's?<br /><br />With the auto ship purchase, the price of this bag is literally half of what it is in the stores.",5
"I'm a recent convert to Bahlsen cookies, and these little wafers are a standout among a product line that's hard not to love.  The crisp. toasty, slightly nuttly wafers surround a very light, not-too-sweet creme layer; the combination is an incredible, multi-dimensional treat that would pair nicely with coffee or milk.  The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway.  The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)",5
"The flavor is simply delightful. There is no funny taste of stevia, it's just sweet black cherry flavor. I'm very pleased.",5
"The Dogswell Happy Hips Sweet Potato Chews I bought from Amazon were stale.  I have bought these before, in local stores, and they are supposed to be pliable and ""chewy"".  Although the bags had expiration dates that were in code, each bag I opened, contained ""stale"" chews.  They broke like crackers and I could hear my dog chomping on them like a bone.  I buy them so I can bend them over and put them in her toys or bones - she can spend a lot of time trying to get at the ""treat"".  With these, all I could do was feed them to her like snack crackers.  I was very disappointed.  I will continue to buy them, as they are a good product, just not from Amazon.",2
"I have had Arizona fruit smoothie mix from Sam's which was rich creamy full of fruit and flavor.  Sam's didn't have the smoothie mix this year so I brought this product instead.  This stuff is NOT the same as the Sam's mix, not even CLOSE!  It looks like some watered down kool-aid and taste even worst.  I think this is scam and they just filled a bottle with kool-aid and called it 'smoothie mix' and frankly I'm surprised Amazon would allow them to sell such a bogus product.  Stay away from this overpriced horrible stuff.",1
"I switched from another, much more expensive, brand and now prefer this one.  This Vitacost coconut oil is not as clumpy as the brand I was using; and therefore easier to work with and mix with my flax and cottage cheese each day.  The flavor is good and I like the statements on the container:  organic, cold pressed (to leave in all the good healthy stuff), lab tested for heavy metals, etc.  Overall, an excellent value.",5

"I buy this tea in bulk because I drink it at work (beats the heck out of bad office coffee) and everyone who smells it wants to try it.  I have had the other version (spice chai) and love that this tea is also made in the double spice version.  I've had chai tea many places, and I've yet to find one with the beautiful flavor this one has.  The packaging is convenient, individually wrapped and easy to dispense in the box - I keep it on my desk and invite people to come by and grab one.  This tea includes clove, cinnamon, and cardamom and black tea - a wonderful, flavorful concoction.",5
"It's pretty expensive considering how much chips is actually in the package. But, it tastes great (similar to durian chips I've had in Thailand) & healthy to boot. If you've never tried durian / heard notorious things about the fruit / hated how the actual fruit tasted, fear not! It doesn't taste/smell remotely like the fruit: more like non-oily potato chips with a smooth buttery aftertaste.",4

"The sampler had a pretty good selection of flavored coffee, but the least desirable flavors (with the worst reviews) were the most prevalent.  Im not sure why they would include 1 or 2 samples of the highly rated coffee, and 6 samples of the very low rated coffee.  Maybe they were just trying to clear out some coffee they couldn't sell otherwise. If they would put 2-3 samples of every coffee, the customer could sample more variety. I did give a rating of 3 stars because there were some good flavors included, and I found a couple of new favorites.",3

I would like to see what I will actually be eating should I use these, and that info is not available here.<br /><br />Note: the ""1 star"" awarded in this review does not reflect on this specific product, of which I have no firsthand knowledge.  It's just that I couldn't post this review without choosing 1 to 5 stars.",1
"I have tried the Jack Links Jerkey chew a few times, mainly as a way to have a little flavor in my mouth while working in hot/dusty conditions. This seems to be the only brand you can find stocked on convenience store shelves.<br /><br />In terms of the flavor, the ""Original"" is pretty mild. As noted by a previous reviewer, I also found the can didn't seem to have much in it. However, it only takes a small pinch at a time. For me, I thought it was a little too much on the dry/powdery side. Realistically, it's probably the ""ground up"" pieces that probably fall to the side when they are packaging their regular jerkey. It does highly resemble the ""genuine"" bacon bits that you buy at the grocery.<br /><br />For what it was, it was OK. I would like to see it a little more ""shredded"", so it packs better, and a little less ground up (like coffee grounds). I'd also like to see it a bit more moist, so it would pack better. As it stands, you have to be careful opening the can in a strong wind, or you might lose half of it. Finally, I think it would be interesting if they had a mildly nicotine-infused version, but that would restrict over-the-counter sales and bring on a whole new level of rules. Otherwise, I don't see where it would really help someone get over a dipping habit.<br /><br />One reviewer noted that this could easily be considered a ""gateway"" path for children to using real tobacco. To that, I would agree on some levels. Much like ""Big League Chew"" resembles a pouch of chewing tobacco, or ""cancy cigarettes"" resembles a real smoke. The important thing, if you are allowing your child to ""eat"" this, is that you convey the dangers of tobacco use and make clear that this is not the same thing. The packaging does not ""make"" the product something else.",3
"I purchased this coffee with high anticipation after I heard it being raved about by the morning radio DJ's.  I was disappointed when I received and tried it for myself.  It doesn't really taste like a chocolate doughnut, if anything it tastes like the hardened glaze that covers the doughnut.  It also has somewhat of a chemically aftertaste.",1
Our 2 kittens who are now 5 months old love Wellness Canned Kitten Food. They lick their dishes clean.

"This lemonade definitely tastes more like chemicals than real lemonade (a product like Simply Lemonade from the grocery store) does.  One reason might be that despite the organic name, there are unnecessary chemicals added simply to make it cloudy.  My other criticism of this product is that the size of it is awkward -- each pouch makes 1/2 gallon plus one glass, so you either always have a little bit left over, or you have to make it in a gallon pitcher that is almost half empty.",3
"My cats like this food and it is truly grain free. However, I think the cans actually contain more calories - especially the Lamb and Venison formulas - than the website states they do. I am very careful about what I feed my indoor cats and don't give them dry food or treats, so I know exactly what they are eating. Whenever I use these 2 formulas they gain weight rapidly. They like it - it has less liquid than other canned foods, so the meat is packed in very dense. I usually add some water and mash it up before feeding. If you cat needs to add a pound or two - this is your food!",4
"This is a good coffee from Tully's, but it is not as bright as Full City.  Seems to be a little strong without the flavor you hope from a stronger coffee.",3
"As you can see in the photo, this small bag has 8 individually well packaged pieces of very small mochi, about 1.25 inch x 1/2 inch, 52 calories each. It has the usual, good, soft mochi texture. The strawberry flavor of the mochi is light and ""perfum-ie"" as the best way for me to describe it. The filling in the middle is not like the picture because it is more flat but if if you bite it in half lengthwise (rounding it out), it's like red gelatin with a white ring around it, with the center part being very sweet. Being so small, you would pop the whole thing in your mouth and savor (or not) your 52 calories. As a whole, I really like the other flavors  and types of ""Royal Family"" brand mochi in the multi-pack and order it though Amazon's great ""subscribe & save"" program, but I guess I'm not a perfume type guy, (when it's in my food) ... so I'm going to pass on this flavor.",3

"I've tried several flavors of these Newton thins, the blueberry and cranberry orange, and I confess I just didn't like the taste of the honey fig that much. The cookie was nice and crispy though, and I like the fact that they are lower calorie and I think they would make a good ice cream sandwich, but to me, the flavor was lacking and I thought they just were kind of bland.<br /><br />The original fig newton was marketed in the 19th century by Nabisco as a health food and it was believed to be a healthy product and to aid in digestion. I don't know about that, but the calories for these cookies are fairly low, and the ingredients aren't as bad as some snack foods.<br /><br />While I didn't care for the taste, I'm sure this will appeal to some people.",2

Immediately upon opening I was hit with the distinct smell of cat food. How do you make beans and corn smell like cat food?? The beans and corn were mushy and tasted horrible. Maybe its a French thing, but my American palate did not like this one bit. Please do not submit your mouth to such torture.",1

All you have to do is open the bag and smell what's inside.  It smells so good, you might be tempted to try one too.<br /><br />We love the 5 pound bag.  Having multiple dogs, this bag really is a cost saver.

My next thought, after reading the description was ""Why would anything sold with the name 'thinkTHIN' NOT tell you the calories in their description?""  Wouldn't just about anyone who is looking for a healthy, nutritious treat want to see the nutrition information?  Come on, people!  What are you hiding?  I will certainly NOT order these until I see more information, be it here or somewhere else.  Maybe the nutrition labeling is here, and I just don't see it, but it should be front and center.",1

Well, they showed up in a nice container and they're in very simple - convenient - unmarked white tube packets (type of flavor is stamped on them).  They're FRESH ground coffee, can make more than one cup in a coffee maker, and are CHEAPER than Starbucks who charges $9 for a 10pc INSTANT box of coffee.......I bought my French Roast & Sumatra at 25pcs for $11.99 each!<br /><br />So far the team has used their packets in a regular coffee maker and one of those ""single serving"" versions.

"It's hard to tell if this is a truly good coffee. It very may well be when the beans are fresh. As soon as I opened the bag there was that vague smell, almost musty and definitely stale. I made a pot anyway. (I'm cheap that way.) Honestly, the stale smell is not evident after brewing but this is a mediocre coffee at best. Maybe it would be better if the beans had been fresh, maybe not. The flavor is almost rich, almost dark, almost really good. It just somehow misses the mark. The beans themselves were, aside from the smell, decent; uniform, a good color and firm. I've had much better coffee and I've had much worse.",3
The grocery store where I shop discontinued this particular Sun Maid dried fruit mix. My husband loves to have this particular mix on his oatmeal in the morning.SO happy to find on line AND at a better than grocery store price.

"Before my breadmaker arrived I tried this mix by the Kitchenaid Standmixer, the dough was very sticky, so I've had to add more breadflour. Eventhought the dough was still sticky and I've let them rise almost 4 hours before baking, it came out of the oven very dry and it tasted sour... so so... not really good. The second mix I put in the breadmaker and just let the breadmaker do his job, it came out very good , the taste is perfect. If you have a breadmaker and you like sourdoug bread, you should try this mix",3

"The Knorr mixes I bought I bought for myself for Oktoberfest, 2008; they were spicy and delicious.  The weather was just starting to turn, and the spicy paprika taste of the Hungarian Goulash was a perfect warmer.  The dishes were easy to prepare--just boil veg and fry stew beef and add to the Knorr sauce and heat.  If I had made the sauces from scratch, it would have taken a lot of different, possibly expensive spices.  I appreciated a reasonably-priced, time-saving alternative.  Happy Oktoberfest!

Why was this cake so dry?  Did I overcook it (by 5 minutes)?  It crumbled mercilessly and the streusel was missing in the middle of the cake.  Why did the directions say to whisk the glaze...my whisk got all balled up.  I really don't think that this saved any money and not much time.  I will never buy this again but the taste (ignoring the texture) was good.,3

"Starbucks Via will not replace a well-crafted hand-brewed cup of coffee from your favorite coffee shop, but it's a hell of a lot better than what you probably expect instant coffee to taste like.<br /><br />If your experience with instant coffee stops at Taster's Choice or Folgers, be prepared to be wowed. Those products produce a result that tastes and looks like water with some coffee flavoring. Starbucks Via is much more like a ""real"" cup of coffee.<br /><br />Another advantage of Via is that the packets are soluble in cold or tepid water, so it's possible to mix yourself a glass of iced coffee right away, rather than having to brew and then cool coffee first.<br /><br />At about $1 per cup, it's certainly less expensive than fresh-brewed Starbucks coffee, though it's still more expensive than brewing coffee at home using a drip maker, french press or whatever other process you prefer. But for when you're on the run or on the road, it's quite a serviceable and enjoyable cup of coffee without too much muss and fuss. I bring Via packets with me when I travel, for example, and keep them on hand for when I'm not in the mood or don't have the time to brew a whole pot.",4
"This is my first Foods Alive product. I like them, but don't like them a lot. My biggest problem is that if you eat more then two or three crackers they coat your teeth and you spend the next half hour trying to get it off with your tongue! I will buy more and will try different flavors and varities. They are better with some kind of dip or cheese then just plain in my opinion.",3

"We have picked up a number of Emerald nuts recently.  We liked Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds, 11oz Canister (Pack of 4) and absolutely loved Emerald Marcona Almonds, 11.5oz Canister (Pack of 4), but we did not care for these at all. I have no problem with the quality of the product, but I do have a problem with the recipe.<br /><br />In theory pepper and sea salt sounded like a great combination.  Salty with a slight peppery taste sounded great, but in reality, the pepper was overwhelming. Everyone in our family tried them and no one cared for them. The sea salt alone would have been good, and even a lighter coating of pepper would have been okay.<br /><br />We love Emerald nuts in general, this one just wasn't a hit with our family.",1
"These seasonings are great for flavoring just about anything. Great on eggs, salads, and popcorn. It gives the food a nice bacon-y flavor without bacon. They are low sodium. One of them is gluten free, but the rest are not. I would have given them 5 stars had all of them been gluten free.",4
"I agree with the other reviewers who say these Vine are stale and HARD. I had been buying these almost exclusively through Amazon and was willing myself to like them as they were sugar-free and a better option for my sweet tooth. After gnawing through the first batch I got from Amazon, I was notified the Vines were not in stock and headed to a local store and bought a package. HOLY MOLY! It's like night and day!!! That's what Vines are supposed to taste like!!! they were SO soft and I could chew them without getting TMJ. I realized that all Vines are not created equally. I thought, ""hey maybe my first Vine batch was a bad apple"" and lo and behold, my next batch arrived last week....I rushed to open the package and taste the chewy goodness I experienced from my local drug store Vines and NOOOOOOO Hard as a rock! I value my teeth so I am going to cancel my subscribe and save on these Vines. I will pick them up at my local drug store where I can squeeze the package and make sure they are fresh and not going to give me lock jaw. I suggest others do the same until Amazon works out their freshness problem. Maybe my children can use these to make a craft or school project, because they definitely are NOT edible.",2
I thought this particular brand of gf mac n cheese was disgusting.. I threw it out - painful considering how expensive it was!  It had no taste.. Buy tinkiyada elbow rice macaroni and make your own cheese sauce.. It's much closer to the real thing..,2
"The flavor is just OK, didn't like that it is totally filtered and has USA as well as Mexico on the label.",3
"Ok, we all know people have different taste levels. You all know the people who grab the salt shaker and empty it over their already salty meal. I'm sensitive to flavorings and with some flavored coffee I just fill my cup almost to the top with unflavored and add a little flavored at the end. This Melitta is like that. WOW. I am totally unable to drink this package undiluted with regular coffee, it would have to be strongly diluted. The flavor is INTENSE and I think the cause of some reviewers saying the coffee is bitter or burnt. I don't think it's the coffee, I think it's the flavoring. I might try it later just adding a little to unflavored coffee but right now I have to rinse and rinse my mouth, which is still tingling/burning from the vanilla flavor. No coffee flavor got through for me.<br /><br />I do drink flavored coffee and like it, just can't recommend this brand. Oh, and the bag!<br />I was very careful trying to open it but ended up making holes so had to get the scissors and cut it.<br />I'm giving it two stars instead of one because I haven't tried adding a little to regular coffee.",2
"I don't understand why the flavors included in this variety pack are not listed in the Product Features section, just below the photo.  One has to read down PAST the legal disclaimers to find what flavors are included.  And even once one gets to the Product Features section which reveals the included flavors, one must first get past the hype:<br /><br />Product Description<br />Every refreshing variety lets you add flavor to you water without adding calories. These are great for bottle water. Comes with 4 flavors; Wild Strawberry, Raspberry Lemonade, Natural Lemonade, and Cherry Pomegranate<br /><br />Despite the concerns that Aspartame is not harmless, I do drink a lot of Crystal Light.  Sugar is not harmless either, for some of us.  I can't afford the sugar and calories in real fruit juices as a beverage choice more than once a day.<br /><br />Crystal Light ""Natural"" Leomonade flavor is delicious.  What I don't understand is why all of the other flavors have a bad aftertaste.  I suppose it must have something to do with the  tartness of the lemon-like flavor that disguises it.<br /><br />""Natural"" Lemonade: aside from the ridiculous use of one of big fake food's favorite BS terms, ""natural"" (good grief, just look at the ingredients list!), this, for my taste, is the best Crystal Light flavor.  Though it's not what most people would consider natural, it does ""taste"" remarkably like real lemonade. However, I do use nearly twice the amount of powder and loads of crushed ice to get that taste.<br /><br />Raspberry Lemonade: Artificial tasting, slight bad aftertaste, you can improve this by adding half a real squeezed lemon. This used to taste better, but about a year ago it changed.  It still has less of the aftertaste than most of the other flavors.<br /><br />Wild Strawberry: Too fake tasting and terrible, strong, bitter, fake sugar aftertaste.  Almost as bad  as saccharine.<br /><br />Cherry Pomegranate: ditto<br /><br />My final complaint is the cost. I think there's a good deal of corporate greed involved here. I imagine the profit margin is astronomical. (Yeah, I know, I don't ""have"" to buy it.  They don't ""have"" to be greedy ba$t@rd$ either.)",2
I have been buying turkey snack bites for several months. I have enjoyed them tremendously until this last shipment. Most of the bites were mushy inside the skin of the turkey bite. Now they are dog treats.I have wasted my money because I can't eat them. I really miss the old kind (like the shipment before this one).........Pam Hodges,2
"Tortilla soup is one of my favorite soups, and I like both the tomato and chicken broth varieties. Although I didn't expect freshly fried tortilla strips or queso fresco in a canned soup, I did expect something that resembled all other tortilla soups I have tried, that is a LIGHT broth with a mix of vegetables, corn, beans chicken and Mexican spices. This soup is thick - really thick, like the thickest tomato soup you've ever had with a grilled cheese sandwich. It's also sweet, and does not taste in the least like a Mexican soup. Instead, imagine straight tomato soup with a bunch of vegetables, beans and some chicken thrown in.<br /><br />I ended up giving it all away, and, to be fair, one of the people I gave the soup to said her husband really liked it.<br /><br />For a canned soup that much more closely resembles real tortilla soup, try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014EUB7I"">Campbell's Select Mexican Chicken Tortilla, 18.6-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.",1
High fructose corn syrup out the ying yang! You figure people wouldn't have to complain any more to get companies to do the Right thing about this ingredient and others that may not be or have been shown to be bad for human consumption.,3

"This coffee has a fairly good flavor but if you put anymore than 6 ounces of water in the machine you get weak, Presbyterian coffee. And you bold, yummy coffee drinkers know what I'm talking about. I find that I use way more of this because I can't put much water with it.",2
"Planters, the company, behind tin and glass boxes of peanuts, has decided to diversify their portfolio and to begin making snack bars that capitalize on their tasty nuts. Sounds ideal? Hardly.<br /><br />I found the taste of these nut bars awkward and preserved. One feels bloated and full (at 220 calories per bar, it's hardly surprising!) after eating one of these bars but not satisfied. The peanutbutter backing serves the purpose of underlining the flavor, but there is no flavor to speak of, and thus nothing to highlight.<br /><br />Planters, do everyone a favor and stick to producing peanuts. Leave the snack bars to Clif Energy Bars and other companies. And the consumer will be better off getting tastier morsels of nutrition elsewhere.",1
"Numi Organic Chocolate Pureh makes a nice cup of tea and it is good to know organic methods were employed in its production. There is not much chocolate or vanilla flavor, it has a sort of a non-descript brown herbal mugginess. I tried putting milk in it because that is how I enjoy black tea, but it was not a good fit. Maybe sugar would give it some zing, but I don't want to start putting sugar in my tea.",3
"Really good when I first opened the pack; however, it seems to lose its effectiveness rather fast, refrigerated or frozen.  I will not buy this brand again.",2
I could not drink this as it has to much sugar 25 grams. So had my husband review it for me. He likes the taste and gives him energy after a workout. It only has 15 grams of protien wich I think is low for the amount of sugar per drink. We both drink whey protien that has way less sugar 1-2 grams per serving and 25 grams of protien. I would not purchase this for these reasons.,3
"I liked everything about this chip except they are too salty...  I accomodated by making my gracamole, and other dips salt free.  Balanced them out.  Texture is wonderful, great corn taste.  I brush excess salt off with a paper towel if I just want to snack dip free.  I won't buy again simply because I don't need 12 bags to have to ""clean"" before eating.  I will try their salt or low salt varieties though as it really is a stellar chip on it's own.",4

"I've been a Chystal Light user for years, and I'm glad they are expanding their product line.<br /><br />At the same time, as a fan of ""adult beverages"" from time to time, I have not found a mix available which comes close to the results to be found with a blender and fresh ingredients.<br /><br />But to paraphrase a popular (if not strange) beer commercial, ""I don't usually drink mixes, but when I do, I use Crystal Light."" It manages to strike a nice balance between tart and sweet, and does not overpower the ""adult"" portion of the beverage to be added.<br /><br />By the way - it's not a bad alternative to lemonade or ice tea when consumed without alcohol.",4

Don't get me wrong. I love Intelligensia coffee... I buy it a lot living in the L.A. area.<br />But this stuff is just straight up not fresh. I may be a little bit more picky than your average coffee drinker since I usually always buy fresh and definitely always grind the beans at home. But there is a noticeable difference between buying from Amazon and buying from the store itself.,2

The candy I received had not one, NOT ONE, whole almond.  There was just crushed nut slivers.  Absolutely not what I was expecting for the price I paid.  Chocolate was of good quality but don't expect it to look like the photo.",2
THis stuff is awesome. I mailed it to my husband in Pakistan and he loves it.,4
"Got 8 cans all together however 5 of them were smashed to kingdom come. Possibly rejects from whatever store or company they came from. Luckily I know about Amazons great customer service and they were happy to make things right. They offered to send a replacement but since they were out of stock, they ended up giving me a full refund. I buy tons of things from Amazon and usually have a pleasant out come. However sometimes there are some blunders. Fortunately I know I can always contact Amazon and they will always make things right. Thanks Amazon! I &lt;3 thee.<br /><br />Now on the product itself. I have used many times. great for making all kinds of desserts. It is regular sweetened condensed milk. Not Dulce De Leche as pictured.

However because most of the order was damaged and useless I give it 3 stars. Confusing? Maybe but that's my story err rating and I'm sticking to it. ;)<br /><br />Dulce De Leche<br /><br />1 - 14 oz can of Sweetened Condensed Milk<br /><br />Fill a large stockpot with cold water. Remove the label from the can of milk, and do not open the can. Place the can in the center of the pot; be sure that the water completely covers the can.<br /><br />CAUTION: The can becomes pressurized when cooking, so for safety reasons, don't allow the water to boil vigorously. Simmer gently for about 1 1/2-2 hours for runny Dulce de Leche, or up to 4 hours for more solid consistency, adding more water, as necessary, when the water level decreases.<br /><br />Remove the can with tongs, and cool 15-20 minutes. Carefully pierce the top with a can opener. The tan or brown caramel will ooze slightly from the can when opening. Transfer to an air-tight container, with the lid off, to cool completely.

The food keeps my dog super healthy; I believe it is the best. Was not happy the bag was ripped in transit or the fact that  I was forced to buy the bigger bag because the smaller one was not significantly less money. My dog weighs 5lbs so a bag this size takes her 6 months to eat.,3
"I think it is going to take an amazing coffee to get me away from my Folger's classic roast and the occasional Eight O'Clock vanilla.

"I had a balance left on my gift card and saw that the jerky was on sale.  So I bought a couple of cases.  This stuff was extra salty, too salty.  Something must have been wrong with the batch.  You could actually see the salt on the jerky.  Had to throw it away.",2
"I have tasted every Pure Bar in the Organic line and like them all.  I love the balance of flavors in the line and the raw aspect makes them feel good to eat.<br /><br />I was so excited to taste the Pure Natural Bars Superfruit Nutty Crunch bars that I could hardly wait to get them.  Once I opened the package though, something just didn't hit me right.  I didn't know that these were different from the organic line when I first tasted it.  I knew after the first bite, however.<br /><br />Compared to the Pure Organic Bars which are raw, these are really a disappointment to me.  The flavor is intense, for sure, but it seemed out of balance.  I tasted quite a few different bars just to be sure.<br /><br />The superfruit taste has a tangy aftertaste which is not too bad, but then there is the taste that almost assaults my senses- like over salted peanuts.  The salt in this is not listed as sea salt and it tastes way too strong for my liking.<br /><br />The blueberry pomegranate and cranberry flavor adds nice contrast but the harsh salty peanut taste really interrupts the flow of flavors in my mouth.  I just am not fond of it.<br /><br />As for texture, they are very soft, sticky, and intense in flavor, so that is not a problem.  The texture is very nice as far as crunch balanced with substance and sticky feeling.  The sweet is not overbearing, but is pretty well balanced, much of it coming from the dried fruit.<br /><br />In summary, if you love the Pure Organic Raw bars, you might not like these.  If you love cooked granola bars that are sticky and sweet like sticky buns, and you love peanuts, you might like these.<br /><br />I prefer the raw bars.  My daughter liked them all right, but she eats peanut butter by the pound and dumps half a shaker of salt on many of her meals.  :)  If you are like her, give these a try.  She loves them.  I have given them three stars as an average between her and my reaction to them.",3

I bought this coffee because several people who also liked my favorite (Jet Fuel or Emeril's Big Intense Bold) liked this one. Typically Sumatra is one of my favorite coffees as well.<br /><br />I am wondering if they made a bad batch or gave it the wrong label.<br />It is **NOT** bold.  It is extremely mild and smoky tasting.  Not a single member of my family liked it and that's very unusual.<br /><br />I'm going to contact the company to see if they'll exchange it or refund me.  It is THAT bad.,1
"I bought this as a gold-box deal, so I got a good price for this cat food; I probably wouldn't have bought it otherwise, since it's a tad bit on the expensive side. I try to buy healthier food for my cats. Since they both liked the liver and beef food from science diet, I figured they'd like this too. It turns out that only one of my cats like it, but the other won't touch it. I'm glad that at least one of them will eat it, otherwise, this would've been a waste of money. Other than that, this product seems to be good, and I like the fact that it's organic.",4
"While ""Wild Ride Beef Jerky Cowboy Strips"" do have a good Hickory taste and are very tender (per treated), they are also fairly salty and leave a lot of ""gristle"" in your mouth. I also like that it doesn't have MSG (I'm alergic) but am disapointed that meat likely comes from outside the USA.<br /><br />On taste alone, my family is split on this jerky with 2 of us liking it (me and my son) and two of us not (my wife and daughter). We all like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPDOI"">Wild Bill's Hickory Smoked Jerky, 6.5-Ounce Package (Pack of 4)</a>.<br /><br />I will not likely buy this brand again, even if it is on sale.",3

"I had high hopes for this Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce.  My family and I enjoy most Taco Bell products; both from the restaurant and the in-store products.  I love their Fire Sauce, and wish they sold it in bottle form at the grocery store.  So when I saw this new Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Jalapeno Sauce, I was excited to try it.  I really enjoy just about anything spicy, so my hopes and expectations were high.  Now that I have tried this sauce, I am somewhat disappointed yet find it to be a good addition to most Mexican foods that I enjoy.<br /><br />The name of the product clearly states ""Bold & Creamy.""  I agree with the creamy aspect of their claim, but feel that the word bold should be changed to something less aggressive, like tangy.  You definitely detect notes of Jalapeno peppers in the sauce, but it is quite subdued and has a somewhat artificial taste.  But I'm not bashing the product or saying that it isn't tasty.  I have found my favorite use of this product is with tacos and burritos.  I add a light amount of the Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce to my soft and hard shell tacos, and then add generous amounts of Taco Bell Fire Sauce (I hoard packets of that stuff and always try to get as much of it as I can whenever I visit the Taco Bell drive-thru).  The Jalapeno sauce gives the tacos a bit of a sour cream flavor, while also added just a slight bit of Jalapeno kick.  I have tried this sauce with several other things from sandwiches to salads, and even a spicy chicken wrap.  While I didn't mind the sauce with the wrap, I didn't enjoy it at all with sandwiches and salads.<br /><br />Overall I will likely continue to purchase this product going forward, but I think a single bottle will last quite some time.  It doesn't have a good enough taste to stand on its own, as a dip or as a replacement for other sauces that I enjoy.  I don't find it to be nearly spicy enough, but I also understand that making it much more spicy would likely limit their sales to a more specific consumer market.  It is an above average product that is a solid compliment to some Mexican dishes, but I don't see this becoming a best seller among the Taco Bell brand name.  But I don't think the product is the type that most people will either love or hate.  It falls right in the middle, and I think most people will find it to be moderately satisfactory.  Go ahead and give it a try for yourself.  I suggest picking up a single bottle before buying a lot of 6, as they sell on this site, just to make sure you enjoy it enough to consider stocking up with that quantity.  I hope you enjoy it.  =o)",3
I've purchased this product at pet stores before and the filets are moist and have a nice texture. I recently opened my filets and they were dry and stale even though the expiration date states April 2013. I recommend you purchase at a local store so you can return if you have a similar issue.,1
These are crazy addictive little buggers. The menthol flavor doesn't appeal to many folks: I've tried to give some away with few takers. These do not give you the horrendous gas that the alcohol sugar treat give you but they do give you some. I probably won't buy these again.,3
"I soaked and cooked these in water without any flavoring and when I tasted to see if they were cooked through, I was pleasantly surprised.

Try them & see for yourself.",5

Kids are just pickey sometimes and I gues my son is VERY pickey. It does taste better then the berry flavor thou.",3

"This is the best gluten free pizza mix I've dealt with.  My kids think it tastes great so it's nice that we can actually eat pizza again.  The dough mixes up and rolls out easily.  I also don't have problems with it sticking to the rolling pin or pan like some of the other mixes I've used. It's best to follow the instructions exactly the first time, then adjust accordingly.  I made the mistake of baking the crust early in the day, then adding toppings in the evening.  It was like eating pizza on a cracker!  I also find I have to add a lot more milk than the mix recommends to get the dough to stick into a ball shape, so don't be surprised.  Also, when reheating it turns out much better to bake for 10 minutes in the oven than to microwave your leftovers.",5
"If you love instant decaf you will love this K-cup coffee.  The taste and aroma are pure Sanka.<br /><br />I use a Keurig machine because I don't LIKE instant.<br /><br />So far, one of the worst k-cups I've sampled.",1

"I'm not sure what qualifies this as ""gourmet"".  They make it sound like a pure product and I really didn't read the ingredient list (which I usually do) and when it arrived, I did.  I don't like to use products that contain sugar as one of it's main ingredients, not to mention the preservatives!  Maybe others won't care about that.  I did.  I'm not saying that they didn't say what was in it.  I take responsibility for not paying enough attention.  I guess I got used to buying coconut products that actually WERE pure, without added sugars and preservatives.",2
"When this went on sale at my local grocery store, I decided to give it a try. For the most part these heat and eat Asian meals are unsatisfying. They have a ton of calories, lots of salt, and yet the portions are small and the flavor is kind of meh. This one is different from the others I've tried. The noodles have a nice texture--they are soft in the package not dry. The flavor was tangy sweet. The nuts add a nice crunch. And the prep time is less, because the noodles are pre-cooked. Overall, it was a decent buy. It's a little too high in calories and cost for me to buy/eat for lunch on a regular basis. But for something different, it's a nice choice.",3
"I can't rate this product just yet because I am currently drinking Mother's Milk Tea and I hope it works for me. I tried the Fenugreek and Blessed Thistle and those products didn't do anything for me. I can tell you that it's nasty to my taste. I don't like drinking it whether it's sweetened with honey or not. It's nasty. Maybe this will work since I don't like drinking it. I'll try it until the box is gone, 3x a day. Ahhhhh, the misery, but I'll get through it.",3
"I decided to review this product because I need more fiber in my diet.  Other Kashi bars are almost as tasty as candy bars, and I like both bananas and chocolate.  This snack bar has a pleasant soft consistency, like a soft cookie.  But I was unable to detect either a banana flavor or a chocolate flavor.  All in all, I found this snack bar uninteresting, but useful as a means of increasing fiber in my diet.",2
"This is not what one should expect from a black truffle, but we are not paying the price for a winter truffle. It is cheap, but there is a reason for that: there is no taste and no smell at all.

"My dog, a 5 month old Irish setter/golden mix, LOVES it.  From the moment we took it out of the packing, he went to town.  I, however, am not very sold.  We decided that the treat ball would only be given to him during ""special"" times when he needs to be entertained.  That being said, he's only had it for 4 days during certain times and he is almost through both sides of the treat.  It isn't lasting long at all!!  Also, he was able to get the treat out once, which made me nervous, but hasn't done it since.  I'm not sure if we will keep buying the treats or not.  They aren't cheap enough to justify him going through them in less than a week.  I'm disappointed to say the least.",2

I love the regular style Pop Chips so when these were a Deal of the Day I grabbed a case of them. That was a mistake because these are gross. We had a party that weekend and put several flavors of this style of Pop Chip out and no one liked them. I have no idea what I'm going to do with all of them. I guess I'll take them to work because those people will snack on anything when it's free!,1
"Okay, I do realize that it is not the same as the full sugar version, but I have to start somewhere and my morning mocha is a great start.  I am a lowcarber and I was thrilled to find out that erithytol was the sweetener.  I can't have splenda and it is true that stevia doesn't always make chocolate taste right.  So, I say hooray for Hersheys!  I hope other companies will try and find a replacement for sugar.",4
"Unlike other clueless people this is the Spanish version of Nutella and it is really similar or the same. So if you like Nutella (which most Americans are familiar with, this is the same thing)<br />Composition of Nocilla and Nutella:<br />Sugar, vegetable oil, hazelnuts (4% Nocilla; 13% Nutella), skim cocoa (8.5% Nocilla; 7,4% Nutella), powdered skim milk (4.5% Nocilla; 6.6% Nutella) etc. so clearly the Nutella has more of a nutty flavor but overall Nocilla is a great snack.",4
"The picture makes it look like they will be little portion cups of jelly.  They aren't.  They are packets of jelly (like little ketchup bags) in foil.  They aren't very attractive and I don't want to serve them to my guests.  Perhaps they would be okay for a camping trip.  I called to complain and Amazon sent me another box of the same thing.  They don't accept returns on food, so you should know what you are getting!",1
"I have tried all there fruit products and absolutely love them all.<br /><br />However this Sweet Corn is all but Sweet.  I would say it should be called Salty Corn.<br /><br />I think they would have a Great Product if they did away with the Salt also, or change the Name to Salty Corn.  Cause if this was the first product someone tried from this company-- I dont think they would give the other products a try from there line.  ** My<br /><br />Favorite is : Cherry Berry and Orchard Blend ...",2
"I got this as a gift for a coworker, and according to her, the flower was beautiful, but very flimsy. It fell off from the tea leaves as soon as they tried to pour tea out of the pot...",3
"It is very difficult to find cracked pepper at the regular grocery stores,  especially in rural areas.  I'm very glad that Amazon is selling things like this.<br />The quality is excellent and being able to buy two of these 16 oz containers at a cheap price is awesome.  Whenever I need to stock up on other spices,  I'll check out Amazon first.",5
"I've used these before and was very happy with its performance.  But with my latest purchase, I was surprised to see the sticky area covers only 50% of the trap size. This  smaller sticky catch area means you have to buy this brand more often.  I looked at my old traps and most of the trap is sticky, and covered in moths, but they are not Safer brand traps.  They work just fine, so I say Safer is not a good deal for the price.",3
"Paw Hide- she sniffed a little and went straight to the covers and after she got one off trotted away like that was the prize! I showed her the treats and she proceeded to get them all. She figured it out pretty quick. I use it as a more challenging way of dispensing treats now.<br /><br />Star Spinner- she spun the thing and figured it out pretty quickly. Not much of a challenge there. Still, a fun way to dispense treats.<br /><br />Treat triad- this one was the most challenging, as it has 2 parts to it. She turned the red part around and then went to open the containers. Therein lies the rub. IMO, the container cover extends too far down so as to make it very difficult for her to grasp it with her mouth or her paw. She was unable to get a grip on it so she could not get to the treats. She didn't like this one.<br /><br />Overall, I don't find them to be that challenging, except for the Treat Triad but that one, I think, has a design flaw. Its not mentally challenging but physically so. I'm not sorry I got them but I expected more.",3
"This product tastes like soap. When I called the company to see why, they said it's not food grade. Literally tastes like soap, so it must have been lingering and co-mingling with soap products. The raw tag is misleading - I thought this was edible cocoa butter that you make raw food desserts from. Now I have a pound of chocolate smelling, soap tasting, rock hard chunks to fool with. Very disappointed.",1
"It has been over three weeks and I still have not received this product.  And, they have charged me for it already...",1
"I was expecting more of a granola bar, but this tastes like candy. Not that that's a bad thing! These bars have lots of nuts, including whole almonds, all very sticky and chewy. A little too sweet for me, but I can see these being popular.",4
Love Tomolives.  Had them at several restaurants on the California Central Coast and have bought some for parties in the past.  Wanted to buy some more but can't see spending $10 for shipping on a $15 item...  Sorry,2
"Reading other reviews, I was excited to try this mix since it appeared to be Gluten free/dairy free.  Technically, the dry mix is GF/DF but the basic pancake recipe calls for eggs and milk.  Technically I can use my own egg and milk substitutes but then I could already do this with so many other mixes.  I've found that mixes that request eggs and/or milk really are better with the originals not substitutes.  The best GF/DF mixes already include a substitute so the directions only require water and/or oil or other non-dairy ingredients.  In this case, I will return to my old favorite mixes by ""The cravings place"" - these are truely targeted for a GF + DF lifestyle.  That said, if you are not DF then perhaps this is a fine choice. It would have been better to have a print/picture of the back of the package to more clearly see that this is not a great DF option.",2
"This matcha is certainly of good quality. It is bright green, and mixes well. However, I find it to have a more salty flavour than other matchas I have tried. I can't say I like the salty quality all that much as I think it detracts from the overall richness of the tea's flavour. That said, I am very picky when it comes to matcha and this is just a matter of my personal preference. Others may really enjoy the particular flavour of this matcha.",3
Putting these slices in my mouth for the first time it was instant yuckyness. My 6 year old immediately spit it out. They are very tart. VERY. They are good if you want to slowly eat some but pooping them in your mouth is cause for some serious puckering. They are just okay.,3
These are a little dry but otherwise tasty.  If I didn't have something to drink with them I don't know if I could get it down.  I'm just a little surprised by the glycemic response.  My blood sugar was still 19 points higher an hour after eating one.  Of course everyone's response is going to be individual and different.,3
"As the k-cup monopoly continues to increase the price for Keurig owners, it is natural that we start looking for alternatives.  With retail prices exceeding $.60 a cup for the Keurig branded k-cups, I was definitely happy to see an alternative!<br /><br />These cups look quite different- more like mini filters than the self enclosed plastic cups that we are used to.  They also are not individually sealed.  However,  I believe the plastic kcup is a patented product, so we can't expect the same thing at a much lower price.<br /><br />I have been using this product for a couple of months and have only good things to say about it.  I keep them in a Ziploc bag after opening the initial package (which is vacuum sealed).  The french roast is a very dark, rich roast an one of the few that I have been happy to brew on the larger cup size.<br /><br />This is the best cup of coffee I have had from my Keurig!  If you prefer milder roasts (""house"" or ""breakfast"" roasts) this french roast might not be for you.  If you need to keep your kcups out in the open, this brand might not be for you.  However, if you love a dark roast and are flexible with storage, this is a great economical product!",5
"This product taste like an orange juice, an artificial one but with less sugar and less flavor I didn't like it.",1
"Velveeta box pastas are pretty good. Not high culinary art but solid, easy to make and tasty. That is why this was a disappointment.<br /><br />  First this is no easier to make than melting Velveeta and mixing in pasta and beef. Cheeseburger flavor not really. Lastly it was salty. Really salty. Not usually a problem in a house where salty snacks are adored but every person mentioned it was too much salt. I knew by the flavor and reaction that if I ever made it again I would have to only ad part of the flavor pack. Why bother though when there is hamburger helper, other Velveeta box meals or you can just make put together the ingredients yourself.<br /><br />  This got two stars because it's easy to make, stores for a long time, great to take on a camping trip or college dorm. It is ok, just add the flavor pack to taste instead of by directions. Better yet buy something else.",2
I sent these baskets to my two grandkids.  What did they get?  A worthless piece of junk that I could have bought at the dollar store for less than a dollar!  BE WARNED DO NOT BUY THESE AT THE VERY LEAST IT IS FALSE ADVERTISING. I didn't want to give it one star but couldn't publish the review unless I answered the question.  If I could rate it minus 5 stars I  would although it probably doesn't even rate that.,1
"I have a one year old lab mix that we adopted from a shelter. Got him as a puppy. I got this toy because I work out of the house, and he is constantly wanting me to play with him. Thought this would be ideal. Have no idea whether this is a good toy or not because my dog is afraid of it. He does not like anything that makes noise!! So, in theory it is a great toy, in practice, in my house, it's a bust!",3
"I am not into sugar substitutes because of the potential health risks so when I use sugar it is sugar not a substitute, when I found out that this really was a natural thing I tried it and loved it. It looks like cane sugar, it tastes like cane sugar and it really sweetens twice as much  (or more) as cane sugar. I have been using for a year now and are very happy. A bit pricey but worth every penny. Diabetics will love it.",5
"Came on time,was as described. Wish I knew prior to ordering my dog is allergic to Sweet Potato but not the products fault!  If your dog can do sweet potato this is a great product!",4
"My husband and I both really enjoy the taste of this coffee.  I tend to like a full robust flavor, and my husband likes his coffee on the milder side, but this coffee satisfies us both.  It is 'just right'!",5
"Tastes ok, but what you get for the price, it is a bit disappointing.  By the time you pay for shipping, you are a loser.  Too bad my hubby LOVES peach flavoring.",3
"it's hard to say how much i love this stuff. i've tried many brands, but this is it for me. others tend to taste a bit green and weedy, whereas this brand is sweeter and mild. i could see bringing this with me on a ride on my road bike. best when cold, of course.",5
"I have a 6 pound toy poodle and she would be very depressed without her daily ration of greenies.  She knows that after supper she receives her greenie and she loves them.  It is the one thing that I can depend on her eating.  Since we do feed a lot of soft food, the greenie helps clean her teeth.  The price on these greenies is very good and they were fresh and came in a timely manner.",5
The decaf is fine and I use it with a pod of dark roast to create a half-caf 8 oz cup. Low rating for current price gouging. Should be 25% of the cost. Ouch!,2
"Unacceptable. Thought of giving these away at the office Christmas party last year. THANK GOODESS I TRIED ONE FIRST... yes ONE... and that was enough for me to say never again. I am an avid coffee and chocolate lover, but must warn you... STAY AWAY!!",1
I purchased this product once before from amazon and it was good.  Welll the last purchase of this product was bad.  The barbecue sticks were extremely dry and the taste was very poor.  I do like the product so I purchased from a bodybuilding supplements website and the quality difference was amazing very moist and tasty.  Will not buy this or any type of food product ever again from Amazon.,1
"I get these figs from my local Walmart (can't recall price but, well under $10).  They are a good substitute for the actual dry figs that I got used to but, can no longer find ANYWHERE!.  These are moist and mushy like prunes.  I prefer the dried (actual dry) figs that are chewy and flavorful (not that these don't have flavor but, the mushyness is kinda gross).  I leave the bag open to try to let them dry out a bit.  My 7 year old daughter feels exactly the same way!  I am ordering some of the dry ones on-line in hopes that they are like those I previously purchased at two different stores in the area that no longer carry them.",3
"There's something about the smell of these packets that cause a mild gag reflex, but once I actually add water and all the other ingredients, it's fine.  I think probably it just reminds me of a bad experience I had in the past with something that smelled similar.<br /><br />That aside, I think these are handy little packets to have.  They save so much space in our pantry and you can just grab a few to take on a trip. I calculated the price per 16oz (after you add water) and it came up to be about the same as buying the regular canned or boxed chicken broth from my local Trader Joes.",4
i do not like these they where not tasty at all so do  not waste your money like i did they are not good trust me...,2
"We luved original Zico, but now its taste totally different.<br />When introduced it was pure coconut water which was just pasteurized.  Now it says its from concentrate.<br /><br />Taste little different now!",3
"I just got this 3-jar set today and tried the salsa. I was excited because I had been reading reviews from other Amazon buyers that said the salsa was excellent! Normally, Amazon's reviewers are quite accurate in their recommendations but this time they were just flat out wrong. The salsa is very watery - right away as you tip the jar back and forth, the salsa runs around very quickly and I was suspicious that it would not have enough chunky goodness that makes a salsa tasty. I was absolutely right. The salsa has a thin watered down flavor. There is a muted spiciness that is not worth spending money for. The fire-roasted detail was worthless - it just meant that you would see black flakes from the grilled vegetables swimming around in the watered down salsa. You can get a better salsa at any supermarket - just tip the jar around to make sure that its contents move slowly and look for salsa that markets itself as having won awards at salsa fairs or by chefs. Even boring Pace makes a better salsa than Arriba!",2
"ESSENTIA, a slightly alkalinized water-beverage is a nice product to have on hand.<br /><br />Although, I believe in the benefits of alkalizing with every meal especially with leafy greens, I didn't recognize any benefits from just one 1.5-litre bottle.<br /><br />There was a very so slight silky taste I detected just above the water, but I suspect that because the added ingredients fell below the FDA's recommendation, they could claim that it's still 100% water and no additives.<br /><br />For whatever it's worth, drinking water has no downside.<br /><br />ESSENTIA-- 3.5 stars.",3
You can buy these for $1 at your local grocery store. Please dont waste your money for $16 you can get 16.,2
"The tea was ok.  However it is not caffiene free as it advertised to be. It is decaff.  So that was misleading or incorrect information about this tea and I was disappointed. Due to the cost, I decided to keep it.",3
"For christmas I ordered some coupons from my daughters school for $30.00 off Ohama steaks.  I was excited to try them as I have been bombarded with their ads for the last 2 years and I was ready to test them out.  I went on-line and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them.  I made my choice and fell for some of the last min. add-ons, by choice.  I went to pay and use the gift cards and well you can only use one at a time, having 2 for $15.00 I naturally thought I was getting $30.00 off the total.  With that said I was still willing to go ahead with the order.  $129.00 later I had ordered one of the package deals and the add-ons.  I received my order ups in 5-7 days packaged in a styro cooler.  packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks.  I am a person who loves to grill and do so about 4 nights a week, so I know a little about meat, and how to cook it.  First this is not high end Dry-aged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher.  The steaks are about $30.00 a pound after shipping and the high prices.  The Hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry.  I am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, I really have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this whole deal.  To top everything off I received a e-mail coupon for $20.00 off my next order so the coupon that I purchased was $5.00 more than on-line deals.  Wow Do yourself a favor and spend your money in a good butcher shop of grocery store!!!",1
"Cookie:<br />-Kashi Dark Chocolate Chip cookies are the only packaged cookies I will buy.  Although buying a Kashi cookie makes you FEEL healthier, whole grains, hearty taste, etc; be careful with the calorie content - Each cookie is around 150 calories which is a lot when these are so good and it's difficult to eat just one.<br />-Texture of these for pre-packaged cookies is AMAZING.  Each cookie is about 2 inch in diameter but very thick - you can cleary see the oatmeal and chocolate chips.  These are very satisfying<br />-Chewy, moist cookies; not hard at all<br />-8 cookie to a box - these will go fast once you open them<br /><br />Price:<br />-I've seen the price on these cookies on Amazon vary between $9-12 for a pack of 3.  This is not as good of a deal as you can often find in retail stores.  At Kroger and Target I've seen regular price vary between $3-4 per box everyday, but if you wait for a sale you can get them at $2-$2.50 which is much cheaper than any online prices I have seen<br />-Considering these cookies are only 8 to a box, they are kind of expensive per cookie; the quality of these cookies however is outstanding",4
"Great tatse, but I can buy it for 1/2 this price in the store. hey Walden farms..not all diabetics are RICH. Shame on you !",3
"I am probably one of the few people on earth who has not had curry before.<br />This being my first face to face meeting of it AND having to be the one to<br />put this kit together...well, I did pretty good and it did too.  I was a bit<br />wary but all in all it was tasty and a new item for me to try.  The only<br />thing I was not wild about is that the serving size is only 2 tablespoons<br />(says that there are 15 servings per sauce kit) and for those 2 tablespoons<br />you get 110 calories and 9 gm. of fat (7 of those are saturated) and 5 gm.<br />of carb's...now, ALL that is kind of high for only 2 tablespoons, but I<br />suppose for something different now and then it won't kill anyone...but I<br />couldn't quite give this 4 stars.  Interesting new to me product.",3
"I have to say - at first I reluctantly tried this soup bc it's all my bff had in her pantry.  But WHOA!!  I was pleasantly surprised to find how delicious and healthy this is!!<br /><br />All organic and healthy ingredients...  Simple and very Tasty!!  Can't get better than that!  Love the lentils and proportions of the ingredients - makes this close to a perfect soup out there!<br /><br />The only concern I have - the BPA levels of plastic lined cans.  For now, I rated this a 4 bc of the BPA cans but did hear that Muir Glen is changing the lining to an inert and non leaching lining.  This is GREAT News!!<br /><br />When they change the lining (and proven to be healthy) - this will definitely be 5 stars and beyond!!  Perhaps Muir Glen can provide soup in Glass bottles like some of the other companies...  That would be Perfect!!  I'd buy these by the cases if that's to be!  :D<br /><br />In any case, for those not concerned about BPA levels/exposure - this is one Excellent and Delicious Canned Soup!!  Bravo, Muir Glen!",4
"I really enjoy Ahmad English tea #1, so I tried thier Earl Grey. It has an astringent aftertaste, is too strong, and this particular box has no individual packaging to seal the flavor in. I prefer not to use foil wrapped products for environmental reasons but these packets need to be in an airtight container so as not to loose thier flavor. I really cannot taste much bergamot which is what I enjoy about an Earl Grey. Also, it smells too perfumey for me. I'll stick to Twinings Earl Grey.",3
"I don't know how what I tried could be considered the same as what all the rave reviews are coming in for.<br /><br />When we got our new Keurig brewer for Christmas it came with a sample pack of 12 different coffees. We were excited for the opportunity to try different blends before purchasing an entire (pricey) box of any one flavor.<br /><br />To preface: I enjoy flavored coffees. French vanilla, mocha, hazelnut... Pretty much any variety available. I was really excited to try Gloria Jean's Hazelnut since it was one of the few flavored options in the sample pack. I typically enjoy smooth medium roasts and I can't stand bitter coffee with a pungent aftertaste.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though, this brew is without-a-doubt undrinkable. So bitter and thick. I couldn't believe this was supposed to be a flavored blend. It smelled burnt as soon as it was brewed. We brewed an 8 ounce cup since typically flavored coffees tend to be weaker so we assumed brewing the smaller size cup would allow us to enjoy to most flavor. The coffee was dark in appearance and both my boyfriend and I tried it befor dumping it out in the sink because the taste was so foul.<br /><br />Aside from its burnt flavor and bitter aftertaste, it's also worth mentioning that I couldn't detect any hazelnut notes at all. Very disappointing.<br /><br />I'd never tried a Gloria Jean brand coffee before and now I'm nervous to try another. I might attempt the Butter Toffee flavor if I can find it in a small pack. But I'll avoid hazelnut from now on.",1
"These cherries are awesome as is any produce that comes from Michigan.  I did grow up there, but I am only a little biased.",5
"My wife brought this home from the store the other day and I was amazed at the amount of sugar in them.  Every calorie in this comes from sugar.  While Gerber doesn't add sugar, apples are naturally very sweet, they do sweeten the apples by placing them in a white grape concentrate.  The taste is far too sweet to give to a 10+ month old.",1
"I have tried a large variety of these drinks and taste-wise this one ranks up there with being good, but the ingredients and after effects just bring it way down.<br /><br />I tried this one frozen (slightly thawed) and it actually mushed well. The after taste was not bad and in this form the syrup did not get that bad feel in your mouth like some of these do. But the ingredient list is outrageous with so many bad things and the highest volume of sugar I have seen in one of these drinks (over 65g). The syrup is high fructose corn, and the preservatives and colors just make it worse.<br /><br />I know this drink is sought after as referenced in so many reviews here, but the sugar content and syrup definitely left a bad feeling in my stomach...will not be drinking it again. The cost is too high for this much bad stuff and I could feel it (in a bad way).",2
I enjoy these daily for my morning cup of coffee. Doesnt have a powdery taste and doesnt require any sugar added.,4
"Some of the best dried apples I've had. I like the light cinnamon, and they're not too dry like most of them. Slightly sweet and not sour at all.<br /><br />Packaging is good and I love the organic products! Newman's Own is a superior brand.<br /><br />It's hard to find all of the brands items in the shops, so Amazon is a great place to buy these, especially in bulk w/ free shipping.",4
"I was expecting Dove Men + Care Clean body wash to be more ""man"" specific.  It seems like just plain Dove Soap in a bottle.  We use Dove Soap all the time and have always liked the soft and clean feeling it leaves my body feeling after a shower, but my son and husband call it ""girly"" soap and always opted for Axe or some other brand of ""man"" soap, although they are all very drying to their skin and I have to listen to them complain about dry winter skin.  When Dove Men came out I was thrilled that it would finally be more of the ""man"" soap they want with the  great Dove non itchy soap.  Well, it is definately still the great Dove soap, but it still can't compare with Axe as far as smell. It isn't quite up to the same cologne type smell that Axe or other brands made for men have. I give it 4 stars because Dove is a wonderful soap, and this is a bit more on the manly scent side, but not enough.  Some men don't like a strong smelling soap so this may be great for them, but unfortunately for my guys they want a stronger smelling cologne in their soap.",4
"Bought it thinking this would plug into the Wii and I would be able to use my condenser microphone with it. Well, long story short, doesnt work. But it is still usable with a PC/laptop to record audio. But we can do that with a builtin mic also. Would u like to pay 1$ towards the presidential election?",4
"so many crumbs! out of the four boxes I got, all of them had about 20% of the box that had turned into RICE KRISPIE POWDER. I don't think it's a shipping problem because I have ordered cereal from amazon before and never had this problem. I think it's the design of this cereal that makes it crumble easily. if you like eating mush you might enjoy eating this.",3
"I have an Alaskan Malamute (120lbs) who I do not consider an aggressive chewer, but he is powerful. Even the largest size Everlasting Ball fits entirely in his jaws and he figured out pretty quickly that if he crunches down the treats just fall out. I tried it with the treats you have to screw in to see if it made it more difficult and had the same results. He finishes off the disks and ignores the toy in less than 5 minutes. Total waste for him.<br /><br />However, this toy has been a godsend for my Alaskan Klee Kai (8lbs). When she had a broken leg and was on bed rest for months this toy really helped out and would occupy her for days. Well worth it in her case.<br /><br />I think the key is getting a size appropriate for your dog. If your dog can fit the entire thing in its mouth, it's too small. When in doubt get the next size up, and if you have an XL mouthed breed don't bother.",3
"This used to be the real great one in Northern Italian style espresso - half the price of Illy Normale, and more consistent.  But that's apparently all over now.  I have just had exactly the same experience as D. Cocco reports above.  The coffee was stale, and completely changed - way overbalanced toward one, particularly strong flavor.  I sent a respectful email to them about this, and received no reply.  It wasn't necessary to pay the premium price for imported Italian coffee anyway; it's just that this one was a particular favorite, so I'd spring for it once in a while.  But there are better choices, and for a lot less.  Dean's Beans, for instance.",1
"I have made dolmades and have had some really good ones out of a can, but these were not good.  The flavor was right, but the rice was overcooked and soggy, mushy, and very unpleasant in texture.  I gave the five cans I hadn't opened away with a warning about the rice.",1
"If you are trying to reduce caffeine in your diet, and you drink a lot of tea, this tea is for you! It has a robust flavor very similar to black teas and has no caffeine. We started out by using half rooibos and half black pekoe to test the taste. Now we only use the rooibos. It makes great iced tea.",4
"In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips,  from the best I've ever had to big disappointments.  If you have eaten the LantChips varieties, there is no way that they are not the best as a group; the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products.  Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors.  All in all, its good to have choice--Amazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice.",4
This tastes great although I do add a little more cinnamon. It does not fill you up like homeade oatmeal does but it is still a nice product.,4
I wish they had not added the sugar but this is one of the few non medicine products that actually helps alleviate the intestinal problems that go along with getting chemo-therapy. My wife uses these regularly. She is on a very strong chemo-therapy treatment and these counteract the intestinal cramping and allow her to maintain weight.,4
"If you are looking for a cup of tea with no real flavor, please buy this. I am an avid tea drinker; Oolong tea has a pleasant aroma of oriental spices and good flavor that dosent require added sweeteners. If you enjoy a good cup of tea, this is not the product. This tea seems like a combination of cheap teas, none with a hint of oolong. The tea even gave me a headache! The price of Oolong tea usually ranges between $5.00 to $7.00 for 20 tea bags depending on geographical area of the country. I should have known that $4.95 was too good to be true. They wont go to waste; tea bags are great for soaking tired aching feet after a run or treating foot fungus.  Certainly not organic!",1
"Unfortunately, I somehow stumbled upon this product and, based on all the glowing reviews, bought a case.  Upon opening the first bag and eating a couple, I was disgusted by the taste.  Worst thing I've ever ordered from Amazon---and I've ordered a lot.  I don't think the nutritional values are all that great, either.",1

"I love Earth's Best and I was a little weary of ordering it online. But, everything was great and just what I would expect from this brand. I do have to say that it was not as chunky as I thought it would be. My son is almost 10 months old (only has 2 bottom teeth) and he is somewhat picky about textures, so I mix it with oatmeal and he is a happy camper.",4
"Not a great taste...not a product I could honestly recommend. Also it is a wafer, not a bar...I would stick with a bar.",3

"I've tried this brand as well as the ""Cento""  DOP certified 'grown in Italy"" San Marzano, and I'm sorry to say, I do NOT see any difference in flavor. San Marzano is identified as much a type of tomato as where it is grown.<br />Just as I don't consider a 'beefsteak' tomato as being cut from a cow because it has the word 'beef' as part of its name.<br />Frankly, I almost prefer this brand over the Cento brand because these tomatoes come pre-crushed. This means I don't have to get my hands or a potato masher in there and start tearing up the tomatoes to make them  blend in<br />with the sauce.<br /><br />I'm also not cooking my pizza in a wood fired oven. Shame on me.<br /><br />Maybe if someone is a purist and can honestly distinguish these from San Marzano tomatoes that have been imported from Italy, then they can keep buying the more expensive 'imported' tomatoes.<br />But I just don't see the point in spending $1.50 or more per can to buy 'the real thing' when there's no discernible difference in flavor or taste.<br />Sorry, I just don't feel like belly-aching over something so trivial. I""m baking the pizza for myself and my family, not running a restaurant or trying to satisfy Italian quality laws.<br /><br />These tomatoes are just as good as any others. I didn't give them five stars because while I don't see them as being inferior to 'the real thing', I also feel that I can make my own tomato sauce that tastes every bit<br />as good as the san marzano canned tomatoes. So, while these tomatoes aren't bad, they're aren't perfect either. I've yet to find any that are.",4

"On an empty stomach, in a controlled environment, with plenty of water, I felt no physical change to stress levels, at least not the way that you feel an immediate sense of relaxation from Xanax. Like homeopathic medicince (highly diluted), this product is bunk.<br /><br />But it tastes good, and maybe it could have a little placebo effect.",2
"I've been experimenting recently with leave in conditioners, detanglers, and hair serums that have various oil blends, like argan oil blends.<br /><br />So, I was curious about trying this new product from Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp and Hair Oil.  This product does have several hair oils including mineral, coconut, palm,sweet almond oil, sunflower, soybean, argan oil and shea butter.<br /><br />Just like cooking oils, some are good for you, some are not, but any kind of oil is going to be oily.<br /><br />My suggestion is to pour a few drops of the oil into the palm of your hands, and rub your hands together before running them through your hair, because if you are going to go right for your scalp, yes it's going to make your hair look greasy, oily.<br /><br />I have very thick long hair, so the amount you might want to use may be different, but I started with about a nickel size, and ran it through my hair, starting on the ends first, then applied the rest to my scalp, and ran my brush through my hair to spread the scalp and hair oil evenly.  You can always add more if you find you need to.  You may not need to.  It's always easier to start with less and add as needed.<br /><br />It left my hair feeling soft.  I don't use hair conditioner anymore in the shower since I have been using these kinds of products.<br /><br />Next time I think I would use alittle less of this for my hair.  I also think that if smell is really an issue for you, using less of this product will not make the smell as intense, at least until you get used to it, to see if you really like the scent.<br /><br />I smell everything before I buy it, because if I don't like the scent of something Iam not going to use it.<br /><br />The scent of this scalp and hair oil, it reminds me of pina coladas, or suntan oil, which I think is an appropriate scent for this type of product.<br /><br />The bottle is 3 ounces, which I think makes this type of product last for a very long time, since you probably won't need to use alot of it each time you use it.",3

"I am sure that there are people who like Rishi Golden Yunnan tea, but I just don't like it. To me it is a combination of some tea and hay. (it smells like hay) Other teas I tried, like Sencha Green Tea or Pu-erh Tuo Cha Tea are even worst. Out of four Rishi teas I tried only the Earl Grey Loose Tea is acceptable. As for Green Tea - I like the Japan Sencha Green tea packaged by the Coffee Bean Direct. Anyway, You will not know which tea you like until you tried them all.",1

"First off, you won't find ""tasting notes"" in this as I don't have the developed palate of a wine connoiser.  My take on coffee/wine is - I just know what I like.<br /><br />I happen to love Tully's coffee. This pack is a staple in my house for personal use and for guests.  You get four flavors (French, Italian, House, Kona) of K-cups.  All are on the bolder side of the spectrum, but I wouldn't say they were extra-bold.<br /><br />I like coffee with a punch in the morning as I often only have time for one cup before I leave.  The Italian or French are good for that.  They are the boldest of the four flavors included.  Nice flavor, strong, clean coffee taste without a an odd/burned aftertaste.<br /><br />Kona has a typical (to me) Kona flavor.  Nothing super special, but a good cup of coffee!  I do tend to reserve these for my sister as she loves them. :)<br /><br />House is probably the mildest of the bunch.  A good cup for evening use (or second cup of the day) when you don't need that big coffee BANG.<br /><br />I was worried that when Green Mountain took over Tully's K-cup business that I would have have to find another ""go to"" K-cup.  I've been quite pleasantly surprised that the coffee hasn't seemed to change.",4
"The 'Loaded Baked' version too salty for me. I appreciate the cheese and bacon flavor but after 3 spoon fulls i had to throw it out. It tastes like those bacon and cheese potato chips from the vending machines. I also tried the 'Original Mashed Potatoes' version which is the exact oposite, had no flavor at all. The original version asks for milk, margarine, and salt. This loaded version only asked for water so that's a plus if you're camping or something. I'm still going to stock up on the Original version since it was .66 at my grocery store. But this version wasn't for me.",2
"I'm chewing a piece right now for the review. I wish I could give half stars because I think it falls in about 2.5. Its not that its a terrible taste or bad texture, it just is very...blah for spearmint. The spearmint is very subtle. It almost reminds me of a sweet mint wannabe. This is a VERY sweet gum. After chewing for about 5 minutes most of the mint flavor is nearly gone. It has already started to taste bitter. I would suggest Orbit Spearmint and Spearmint Spritzer. I wanted to like Trident because it's the classic gum but it just falls short.",3

"I don't really think that the design of the cardboard box makes one bit of difference to the flies. House or fruit flies. Flies land on pretty much anything. With sufficient time flies flying around randomly and landing randomly around the house. Eventually they'll land on the fly trap.<br /><br />Perhaps after the first few have landed and died on the trap the rest will be attracted to the scent of the dead flies? Directly out of the box, I don't think there is anything on it that is an attractant.",3
"I enjoy a few snacks and deserts, but I try to keep such things healthy. That is, it has to taste good and be satisfying in that sense, but it also has to add essential ingredients to my total diet and not just empty calories. Of course, the problem with most snacks, candy and chips etc., is that they only add empty calories. They might taste good but they're high on fat, sugar and salt and low on everything else, including fiber. The problem with healthy snacks is that they tend not to be any good. It's tough. Well I found yet another item, and that is Leclerc Praeventia Dark Chocolate Cookies. They're little somewhat dry, flat, heart-shaped cookies with a rich chocolate taste. They say the chocolate is 70% cocoa. Plus, they're whole grain and contain a goodly source of fiber and no negative ingredients, such as trans-fats. Plus there's a long list of other impressive ingredients. Well, they also taste pretty good. I even give a few to my little boy (3 1/2) and if he eats them that's a good test. He does. If I had any complaint, it's that they're rather dry. Just counter that with having something to drink nearby.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",5

Also the package tracking had me quite stressed.

The cans from the pet stores expire about 3 years in the future, so the Amazon cans were probably 2 years old.<br /><br />We threw them all away and switched back to buying the exact same food from the pet store.

"If you have lived in Mainland China, you would know that it's almost impossible to get clean food, let alone organic and/or all-natural food.  How this maker can ensure that is beyond me.  But let's give them the benefit of doubt for now, shall we?  The noodle pack size is way too light/small.  It's like 1/2 the portion of regular instant noodle.  The noodles tastes quite chemical-free to my sensitive tongue, that's good.  Aftertaste was minimal, that's good.  Soup base pack is a lil' on the salty side, noodles didn't absorb the flavor too well.  At this time, I may not re-order...",4

Updating my prior review from  2009 as my dog was very sick with a mystery illness last year with enlarged liver and kidney issues.  I was heartsick as he was so ill.  I spent several thousand dollars on vet care and testing.  It never dawned on me it could have been these chews -- I just realized that they were made in China and the brand is listed as one of those implicated according to this month's Whole Dog Journal.  Amazon should stop selling These until the manufacturer stops using their China plant.,1
I opened my bag i just got in today and it contained all extra bold coffee. Not much of a sampler if all 42 k-cups are all extra bold. I didn't even know their was that many different types of extra bold coffee. I would think their would be normal coffee and flavored coffee and maybe even some tea. I will not be ordering this product again.,2
"Frankly, I don't care if food is organic, or non-organic, or natural, or whatever. I like food that tastes good. And while I recognize that cookies aren't really ""food"", in the sense that they're a desert -- and certainly not something you turn to if you're looking for your basic nutrition, I find these particular cookies to be totally AWESOME. I like my oatmeal raisin cookies soft, and that's what these are. Soft, sweet, chewy, superb. I wouldn't mind if they were a smidgeon cheaper, but I would imagine making them organic adds to the cost -- so I blame you danged hippies with your granola-crunchy desire for kumbaya soul harmony when it comes to the sticker shock. Still, they're good enough they're worth it. They'll probably negatively impact my waistline, but as I'm not a believer in reincarnation, I figure I got one shot at existence. May as well take the time to stop and gorge on the cookies.<br /><br />The delicious, delicious cookies.",5

"Since this is promoted as a healthy product, it receives 1 less star for the use of a very thin plastic. Thinner than what you find in regular soda/pop bottles. Since this is a health product, and plastic (especially thin one) is said to slowly leech into the water, it seems strange they did not opt for something more substantial/higher quality, given the price.<br /><br />Another star due to the price, which would be hard to justify.<br /><br />There is lots of research that points to good health depending on your body's Ph and this is how this water differentiates itself from others.<br /><br />One thing that surprised me, is that I could tell the difference between this water and the one that comes filtered out of the fridge. It reacted/tasted differently s soon is it hit my mouth. Granted it's not a huge difference, but I am not a water conossieur and I could tell. (Had someone else poor 2 cups and bring them to me)<br /><br />I'd probably give it 3.5 stars.",3
"Great tasting fruit snack. As others have commented, it is somewhat on the sweet side, but it is still better than corn syrup and hydrogenated oil filled candy bars. Sweet and sour (lime juice on papaya is genius!) for a good kick and fine texture. Perfect companion to a shot of espresso (I know, thought coffee and fruit is weird until I tried).

Buyers who truly scrutinize the organic field of products would not likely choose this or similar items.",2

"Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix is a dry mixture of ginger, honey & natural lemon flavor, packaged in foil pouches. It dissolves quickly & completely in hot water. I added one packet to an 8 oz. mug of hot water. Wow! the ginger was spicy! It was perfectly sweetened with a hint of lemon.  My Indian friend who  loves ginger thought it was too gingery & too sweet.  After she added twice as much hot water to her drink, she thought it was perfect.<br />The directions state: ""You can control the depth of favor by how much (mix) you add to your cup.""<br /><br />If you love ginger, you'll probably enjoy this beverage mix. And, like my Indian friend, you also might get more than one serving from each foil pouch.",4

"I bought these antlers for my adult Doberman, my Catahoula Leopard Dog, and my Doberman puppy. All three like to chew on pig ears, rawhide, busybones, ect. After reading reviews about antler dog chews, I thought that purchasing the antlers may offset the cost of constantly buying rawhide since the antlers are supposed to last about a month. Unfortunately, none of the dogs even gave the antlers 5 minutes of chew time. This product may be better for people with heavy duty chewers. I read that the inside of the antlers are the best tasting for the dogs, but it doesn't look like my dogs will ever get to the inside. I will not be purchasing any antlers again, and I'm out $30+. As for the seller, I did receive this product in a timely manner. Note that the antlers are  placed in an envelope without any packaging.",2

"I like these t-discs for their convenience but like others here, I would rate these a step below the flavor you get with the tea-bags. I gave the English Breakfast a 5-star rating because I think the disc makers got it right with that mix. To be fair, the Bergamont flavor that makes Earl Grey so appealing has to be hard to reproduce in a quick-drink type machine. Twinings does it well enough. I would still purchase these discs and can taste the flavor in the tea. It's just not quite as strong as what you get when you brew the tea conventionally. I'm certain Twinings will continue to work on the mix and soon, this will likely not be a problem.",4

Notice that this product title starts with ""Alaskan Salmon"", minor quib, but ...<br /><br />My order consists of 4 cans of ""Grained Salmon Caviar""  looks and smells nothing like the sushi restaurant roe.  A lot of the eggs were crushed I'd say around 80% to 90%.  The ones I get from the sushi restaurants are all intact little bubbles.  It might be because its concentrate, but I don't remember the Roe in the restaurants smelling like olives. I don't like olives<br /><br />The can labels are russian but I can see ""made in USA"" and made on March 28, 2011.  This contradicts with description of 2 week shelf life.  So this product has already been expired, possibly they mean when its opened.  It was September when I received it.  I was a bit turned off by the large difference in ship and made date.<br /><br />The order arrived a day later than expected.  That is fine however it was only shipped after I inquired its status.  The shipper said he/she was ""sorry I was out of town"".  The product was pack tightly, but the ice pack that was packed with has already melted by the time I got it (I opened the package immediately upon receiving, knowing it was perishable).<br /><br />This is the first time I ordered Salmon Roe, perhaps they all come like this.

"Got a chance to try these Newman's Own Organic Pomegranate Licorice Twists and I have to say that I enjoyed them, but I didn't love 'em.  I've never been a huge fan of the ""red"" licorices, finding them a bit bland and much more plastic-y than your standard black anise licorice, and these certainly fall into that camp.  I was expecting more of  a burst of pomegranate flavor, but it's rather subtle unless you really keep it in your mouth and savor it.

It's not a miracle by any means, but it helps as much as I feel it should with what it advertizes. I would not use this if you wanted to treat something like wrinkles, but it's very hydrating so it's great for preventative measures. I use it twice a day in addition to massage to relieve my dark circles and it seems to work great. My only complaint is that the bottle can be really stubborn and I have to give it several pumps before any product will come out, but other than that it's a great product. I highly recommend it.",4
"Yes, it's most certainly better than coke or the usual carbonated drinks since it has nothing artificial added to it. It has a cool name and the taste is quite good. For those people addicted to soft drinks, this might be a better alternative but for people who don't drink much soda like me, I don't see why you would switch to ""Switch"" since you are still drinking a carbonated beverage when there are still better alternatives.",3
"The active ingredient in this sytemic is imidacloprid.  It is adbsorbed by the rose plant into the leaves, but not the flowers I learned recently online.

Unless you SPRAY the flowers with another product containing the insecticide, the Japanese beetles devour the rose flowers and leave th leaves alone.<br /> see link<br />[...]",3
"Before I bought this product I read several reviews saying that this stuff was amazing, that it made everything super sweet. So I thought I would try it out, and it is pretty cool, but not worth the outrageous price. About one minute after I sucked the tab I tried eating numerous things like limes, lemons, and oranges, just to name a few. It did make everything that's sour sweet. Not to the point of ""oh my god, it's amazing"" but it did work. So to sum this up, this stuff was good for a one time deal, but after doing it a few times it lost it's appeal.",4
"Dogs will eat most anything reasonably edible, the ingredients in this dog food mimic the typical grocery store fare for dogs.  A lot of grit and not much substance.  Still my dog likes the taste as long as he doesn't have something to compare it to he'll eat it.  Before this I get him EVO a healthy blend of ingredients very short on the fillers and artificial colors.  Unfortunately for Beneful, I think it's marketed to owners by looks on the bag and as long as the dog lives and doesn't get appreciably sick people think it's OK.  If you read the ingredients and thought would I eat that, the answer would be a resounding no.  I was hoping this would be as good and wholesome as the last dog food I got on the vine, but no such luck, but the dog likes it, so go figure, I still wouldn't buy more.",2

"I bought this for my daughter's dog. He is a hybrid, probably Australian cattle dog and Jack Russell and weighs less than 40 lbs. It took him all of 2 minutes to figure out that he could get the large treat out of the ball by getting one canine tooth under the edge and pulling. The second one came out even faster! The treats themselves did take him about 5-10 minutes to eat. As far as entertainment value and boredom relief while in his kennel? I couldn't even give it to him in the kennel because the ball itself was too easy to chew up once the treats were out of it.<br /><br />Not impressed, not worth the money, doesn't do what it's advertised to do, won't bother ordering more of the treats to fit it as they are quite expensive and I can keep him entertained longer with a Kong or Nyla Bone. Modification in design so the treat doesn't pop out so easily might fix it, but at this point, for the price, don't bother.  Waste of 20 bucks.",1
"I ordered the six pack of Lyle's Black Teacle and it came with two of the six cans dented and leaking, one badly enough to have to be thrown away.  I'm taking a chance on the other one.

The last one we bought arrived with a broken pot.. although Im pretty sure that it wasn't their packaging but bad handling during transport..The packaging was sufficient.. Anyway we emailed and they replaced the plant right away with another that was as nice as the first one.Thanks.. All of their plants have been wonderful ,none losing so much as a leaf.. They arrived super fast and beautiful.. AAAAA+++++++Will keep doing business with them over and over..",5

"I like goji berries and have purchased other products from Navitas Naturals of good quality, so when I received these I immediately opened them and tried them. They smelled and tasted off...slightly moldy...but I didn't see any mold. I opened the second package (8oz 2 pack) and they tasted the same. I put them away and disregarded the taste until I started to feel a little sick. I went back to the packages and cut some of the perfectly fine looking berries open...and about 1 in 10 was filled with mold.<br /><br />I will definitely not be purchasing this product again, no matter how packed with nutrients it is. It has made me temporarily paranoid about all of the dried stuff I eat...it all looks fine on the outside.<br />It is a shame there are no returns with this item as I am noticing from reviews that the mold problem is fairly common.",1
"I've had four mugs of this tea over several days and can only  conclude that I do not like it.  I've tried it plain, with sugar, stevia, and soy milk but have not enjoyed any.  To me this black tea (a Ceylon/Assam blend) has a slightly rotted taste.  I do not know if it comes from the variant  blend or the processing.  I like what I've been drinking for years - Prince of Peace organic green.  It's wonderful plain and even better with Silk soy milk.",3

My boyfriend and I saw a comercial for this gum and hunted it down in the grocery store to try it out and LOVED it! I wouldn't pay full price a a grocery store again but on Amazon you can get  a ton of it for a great price. We went through a hundred pieces in like 4 months. It leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean and your breath smelling gently of melon! I haven't tried the other flavors but I love the Melon.,4

This is great for that winding down cup of coffee late night that won't keep you up because of the caffeine.<br /><br />Each sealed package holds ten ounces of extra-fine ground coffee. The bag feels sturdy if you prefer to keep your ground coffee in its original packaging.<br /><br />With coffee prices going up, it may be a good idea to compare the prices of this (if you try this and like it, you get a better price with the Amazon Subscribe & Save option) versus getting coffee beans from your local coffee shop and grinding them at home or having the coffee shop grind them for you.",4

"New Planters® BIG Nut Bars delivers a delicious combination of ""sweet"" and ""salty"" and a balance of chew and crunch making it the perfect snack. It's 30 percent larger than the leading nut and granola bar and provides 7 grams of protein per bar. Available in two varieties - Double Peanut (with crunchy peanuts and chewy peanut butter) and Triple Nut (with honey roasted peanuts, almonds and cashews).<br /><br />I don't normally like eating healthy, nutrituous items, but sometimes a snack can't always be chocolates and cookies! So I tried the new Planters BIG Nut Bars...it is not that big compared to say, most candy bars. The main reason I don't like granola bars is because they are hard! I have good teeth, but I fear chipping a tooth when biting into most granola bars filled with the nuts and dried fruits and caramalized coatings...so I was slightly hesitant to try Planter's...but I'm GLAD I did --- they are delicious!<br /><br />Not only is the first bite easy, but all the nuts still have that fresh crunchiness to them. One of the tests that I do when I want to get a granola/candy bar, is the squeeze the outside packaging, if the bar is too hard, forget it! If it's too soft, forget it! But this has the perfect squeeziness to it.<br /><br />The taste is of a Honey Roasted Peanuts, Almonds and Cashews, and yes, I definitely am tasting those together. It's a good mix and best of all, healthy! I always remember in the news and food books, they recommend eating a small bowl or handful of nuts before your meal so that it helps fill you up a bit (and you'll eat less) and that's the nuts contain alot of protein and such goodies for your body.<br /><br />So yes, it's a good snack, tastes good, is healthy --- recommended!",5
"I tried Emeril's Big Easy Bold after purchasing a Keurig which came with a variety pack of K-cups.  I have to disagree on the great reviews of this coffee.  Honestly, it tastes like bottom of the pot, truck stop coffee that has been sitting for 4+hours.  It IS thick and strong (and exceedingly bitter).  If you like a smooth, full flavored coffee this one is not for you.  In the variety pack, Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend was one of the best.  Neuman's Own Dark was good too.",2
"I should have read the product description better. The artificial sweetner in the Lemon Lime mix creates a drink along the lines of Diet Sprite (or other lemon limey diet drinks). If you like diet lemon lime, then it's probably fine. I don't.",1
"I'm a bit of a noob to serious tea drinking. I've always liked tea, but only recently have I become completely obsessed. Within the last 6 months I've begun to accumulate all kinds of tea. Within that time period this tea has quickly made its way into my favorites and I'll definitely be repurchasing when I run out.<br /><br />I love this stuff. No, I mean I LOVE it. Seriously. While it isn't actually tea at all, it's prepared the same way - add the 'leaves', steep, add preferred additives, drink, YUM. There is no actual tea in this product, it's all cocoa bean shells. Because of this, you have to like the natural, earthy cocoa flavor (like that of dark, dark, dark organic chocolate you might find in a health food store) to like this tea. If you're expecting it to taste like a candy bar or cake you'll be disappointed. While it DOES smell like candy, it simply does not taste that way. (However, I suppose you could add an absurd amount of sweetener to give it a candy taste but that really counteracts a lot of the health benefits of this tea. It also takes away from it's natural taste which is amazing!)<br /><br />The thing that caught my eye about this tea initially was the flavor, of course. What made me really decide to make the purchase was all of the claims. The description says it has vitamin D and iron - which is especially good for someone like me who is both anemic and vitamin D deficient who could use as much of that in their daily intake as they can get- and it also claims to have natural serotonin raising capabilities due to the fact it's pure cocoa, which as most people know, is good for you and full of feel-good elements.<br /><br />While I can't prove or disprove any of those things, I will say this tea is delicious and worth the somewhat hefty price. You get a lot of bang for you buck and unless it's your staple tea you drink every day, several times a day it should last you quite a while.<br /><br />I'd like to note that the tea-to-water ratio recommended on the container might be a little exaggerated. I use a little over half the recommended tea to go with the amount of water I'm using, and it does just fine. It doesn't taste watery or weak at all. And unlike most teas, you can let this steep while you're drinking it and there's no gross, over steeped taste. I've also found you can also re-steep the tea 2-3 times before any substantial loss in flavor. Knowing that that, it can more than double the cups of tea you get per tin.<br /><br />Anyway, the main point is I really like this tea and recommend it.",4
"I received one 11 oz bag of Melitta coffee from the Vine program. I had requested Hazelnut Creme Brulee and that is what the shipping tag indicated. However, the coffee bag shows it to be Blanc et Noir so that is what I am reviewing. I am a morning coffee drinker and usually have one or two mugs. This blend of light and dark roasts is a fairly average coffee blend. It is somewhat heavier and darker than what I am used to having. I find it to be slightly more bitter than what I prefer. The aroma is somewhat pleasing. For a fairly inexpensive coffee it is a somewhat interesting change from my usual brand which is Gevalia. I would not use this on a regular basis but for a change of pace it offers an acceptable different experience.",3

"There's nothing really wrong with these sardines, though as noted below I don't particularly care for their smoky taste. My problem is with the marketing, which attempts to justify an inflated price with a dissertation of a long list of purported benefits. Problem is, most if not all of these benefits apply to all brands of sardines, not just these.<br /><br />One thing I'll say at the outset: If BPA free packaging is your most important purchase criterion read no further and buy these now. The packaging is indeed BPA free.<br /><br />But what about the whole concept of ""wild"" sardines? I'm not aware that the sardine has been domesticated, and the lowly pilchards that swarm the seas in massive schools sometimes visible from outer space are not amenable to aquaculture.<br /><br />On the other hand, qualifying these sardines as wild, notwithstanding the fact that all sardines are wild, does confer a seemingly significant though clearly misplaced credibility. No doubt this will boost sales to a gullible buying public.<br /><br />Read the packaging for these sardines and you can't help but feel you're saving Mother Earth as you chomp on your sandwich. But digging down beneath the surface, there's not so much to be excited about.<br /><br />For instance there's the matter of what happens to these fish after they're ""sustainably caught along the California coast"". The small print provides a clue in that these bad boys are ""processed in Viet Nam"". So what's really going on is that our diminutive sardines take on a heavy carbon footprint, travelling as they do from the west coast to the far east and back again, presumably to harvest the otherwise mutually exclusive benefits of buy-local chic and low labor costs. Nonetheless, we read that, ""These sardines are considered a `Best Choice for Sustainability' by a consensus of environmental organizations"".<br /><br />There are other issues as well.<br /><br />The health benefits of chowing down on this product are highly touted. For instance, ""Ounce for ounce, Wild Planet sardines provide 3 times more calcium and phosphorus than milk..."". OK, fair enough. But is this, as implied, unique to the Wild Planet variety only, or is it once again a characteristic of all sardines? Unfortunately, it's the latter.<br /><br />We also learn that these ""delicious meaty portions"" are ""cleaned and scaled"". Buyer beware: this is quite different from ""skinless and boneless"". ""Cleaned"" in this context must mean something other that what is commonly expected by the use of this word in conjunction with fish. Be prepared to either eat the vertebral column and various entrails, or to remove (clean) them yourself.<br /><br />How do they taste?<br /><br />Not bad, if you're into schmaltz herring. These babies are smoked and have a characteristic smoky, salty taste.<br /><br />But don't worry. It's not just any smoke, but ""aqueous natural smoke"" that they're treated with...",3

"I had never heard for Marley's Coffee before, so as the was reading all of the information on the box, the last thing I looked at was the top of the box, to find out that the Marley is as in Bob Marley!<br /><br />Upon first looking at the box, the first thing I noticed was how the perimeter of the box reminded me of Christmas, with the red, green and gold colors.<br /><br />I especially loved what I saw written on the back of the box.  It really seems to come from the heart.<br /><br />It says ""That pure food from the earth is physically and spiritually beneficial.  They know where their beans come from, and how they are grown.  The coffee is 100% arabica beans.  This coffee is made in small batches, roasted and bagged on demand to ensure freshness"".<br /><br />This coffee is organic and fair trade, which are two issues very close to my heart, and I wholeheartedly believe in supporting both of those issues.<br /><br />This coffee is called One Love.  It's supposed to be exotic floral and berry.  I did not taste either of those notes, but to be fair, I really do prefer flavored coffees over non- flavored, so it's not that this coffee tastes bad, because it doesn't, it's just not the kind of coffee in flavor that I prefer, because it really is not flavored, at least not to me. Maybe your taste buds may be different than mine.<br /><br />Maybe you are one of those people who prefer unflavored coffees who really would enjoy purchasing this coffee.<br /><br />If I were just going to buy this coffee because I like it's message and what it stands for, without a second thought I would definitely purchase this coffee, but if I were only going to buy it based on flavor alone, I probably would not purchase it.  It's really just a personal preference.<br /><br />I wish I loved the coffee as much as the message.<br /><br />I hope you will!<br /><br />What really touched my heart was the last paragraph on the back of the box. ""We believe that the proper place for children is on the playground, not the workplace"".  I wish every country felt that way, but unfortunately doesn't.<br /><br />Part of the proceeds from the sale of this coffee goes towards youth soccer programs.  The program is called Kicks For Cause Foundation.<br /><br />On the top of the box where you can see a small photo of Bob Marley, the coffee was founded to honor his father.<br /><br />That he came from farmland in Nine Mile?  There he learned to have deep respect for nature and humanity that helped guide his life.  I second that thought!  To me they are one in the same.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I enjoyed reading what I read on the box more than I did actually drinking the enclosed coffee, which the box inside the box there are 15 individually wrapped coffee pods.  I had alittle hard time opening the first pod from the the packaging.<br /><br />There is also a Best Before sticker on the back of the box.<br /><br />If you prefer unflavored coffee, and want to support a good cause with an excellent message behind it, this coffee may just be the kind of coffee that you are looking for.",3
"I have been using this product for about 2 months and was soooo happy with it!

I cant belive my daughter hasnt gotten sick from the food I have been making her! Of course we are now past the 30 day warrenty and Im stuck with this nasty nasty machine.

"Reminder - 3 stars means ""it's okay"".  That being said, the most important question is how does it taste?  It definitely tastes like chocolate, that's for sure.  Each piece is a lightweight crunchy pillow much like Captain Crunch, filled with a tiny drop of chocolaty syrup. The pieces are very lighweight, mostly air, so a bowl of this cereal isn't very filling.<br /><br />Each box of cereal is only 11 ounces, one of the smallest boxes of cereal I've ever seen, and that combined with not being very filling means each box is only good for a few servings.<br /><br />But wait! All that would be okay except each box (when ordered from Amazon in a 4-pack) costs $5.00!!  There is no way this cereal is worth five bucks a box.  The front of the box is actually embossed, adding I'm sure to the price of the product.<br /><br />Cereal prices in supermarkets are too high, most people would agree, but for $5.00 one would generally get a box of cereal at least twice as big. I only buy cereal when it's on sale so I rarely pay more than $2 or $3 a box for brand names and often can get store brand for $1.50 a box.<br /><br />Krave tastes okay, better than Cocoa Puffs, isn't all that special, but not bad either. In this instance my 3-star review is based mostly on that, but the high price easily lost them a star.",3
"My cat loves this food, but this particular flavor, beef and salmon, is a bit strong when it comes to the smell. I had to wash my hands more than once to get the smell entirely off.

If you're okay with that, by all means get it, but I'm going to avoid this one in the future because I can't stand her smelling like this all the time.",3

The flavor of the molasses is exactly what you'd expect sweet with a hint bitter and an earthy aftertaste.  I've used it in several recipes with great success.  If I'd purchased this item at the grocery store it would get a 4-5 star rating; however the packaging is not designed to be shipped.  When I received the bottles one of them had opened in transit and leaked over everything.  If you order this through Amazon make sure you open the box over a sink to minimize the area you'll have to clean.,3

"Unfortunately, this product was not enjoyable. I've been using canned pumpkin to make soup and to add to tomato sauce, but they did not taste right with this canned pumpkin. It leaves a starchy almost gritty aftertaste/texture. My only positive comment is that none of the cans were dented.",1
"I buy these in the store sometimes but always have to carefully check the carton top and bottom first because there is no protective bag for the candy inside. If the bottom flaps are not tightly aligned and sealed, small insects can get in. Likewise for the top sides which are lightly glued together and also cannot be resealed once the cartotn is opened. Also air easily gets in so it doesn't stay fresh as long as it should. The candy is much better protected by the small bag packaging it also comes in. Those bags should be used to protect the larger sized items as well, either within the carton or similar to what is done with large size bags of M&Ms. Or another alternative would be to use cartons like those used for milk and juice, which are sealed tightly on the bottom and the top is tightly closed. The candy itself is quite tasty but I must rate this only 3 stars because of the carton.",3

"I love good strong coffee. It's a combination on how it's roasted and the beans used. This coffee is just way too strong. It is unbalanced and though isn't bitter (which comes from weaker coffee) it is a tad over roasted and charred tasting. Instead of tasting toasty nuances you are stuck with a smack in the face. Though very good for that wake up coffee, it's not the coffee to have if you want to savor the rich and delicate nuances that many good coffees bring to the table.",3
"I guess if I had no other taco sauce to flavor up a taco, I'd be okay reaching for this bottle, but it wouldn't be my top choice at all.  As a taco sauce, it tastes too much like Catalina salad dressing, but spicier, which makes me think I might have liked this better, had it been presented to me as a salad dressing instead of a taco sauce.  I don't love it, I don't hate it, but I wouldn't buy it for my Tex-Mex dining pleasure.",3
"I was deceived by the name and by the picture on the box...there was absolutely NO chocolate in my granola. I gave it a 3 star because it does taste good, but it just tastes like regular granola. There were very few almonds and again, NO chocolate whatsoever.

But if you were looking for a smooth, premium-quality English Breakfast tea, this is not it.",2

I generally shake 12 ounces cold milk, 2-3 packets of this tea powder, and 1 ounce simple syrup, then pour it over ice. Tho make the frappe, I blend the same ingredients with ice, instead of pouring it over ice. It is annoying that to make a small drink I need to use 2-3 times more than expected.",3
"When I saw the Spicy Thai chips, I knew i had to try them. I love spicy and I love Thai food, so why not? First off, these chips are not super spicy. They actually taste sort of sweet at first, with many degrees of flavor. The spiciness is more of a lingering taste that bites afterwards. I'd say these are definitely a good, unique chip. But if you absolutely hate sweet chips, I'd try a different flavor since these are a little sweet.",4
"The sugar itself I love.  I switched to this product when we decided to cut refined sugar out of our diet - and I use it in cooking as well as to sweeten coffee and put on hot cereal in the morning.  I especially like it for cooking - the result is a little less sweet than when using an equal amount of refined sugar, with a very pleasant taste like a faint touch of brown sugar.  It's great for sugar cookies and other baked goods that get rolled in or sprinkled with sugar - makes a nice crunchy topping.<br /><br />However, I had been buying it in plastic-lined envelopes that kept the sugar soft and fresh until I opened the package.  These boxes are horrible.  Every time I open a new one, I get a solid brick of hardened sugar that has to be microwaved and broken up with kitchen utensils, then repackaged in a plastic bag with a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004H9LPYK"">Brown Sugar Teddy Bear Clay Disc Keeps Sugar Soft</a> to keep it soft enough to use.",2

"Note:  I received my package of Oreo Peanut Butter Fudge Creme cookies for free as part of Amazon's Vine program.<br /><br />The cookie portion is thinner and more delicate than a regular Oreo, and it is only on the bottom (it's not a sandwich cookie).  On top of that, there is a surprisingly skimpy layer of peanut butter-flavored ""cr&egrave;me"" (much thinner than it appears in the picture on the package), then the whole thing is covered with ""fudge.""  I'm not a fan of Oreos, and I like these even less, though these are really nothing like an Oreo.  The filling is much creamier than Oreo filling, which sounds good, but it's not.  The texture is reminiscent of a mouthful of grease.  The ""fudge,"" too, has a soft, greasy feel.  Don't get these for eating in the car . . . they melt quickly on your fingers.<br /><br />I'm a cookie (and candy) hound, so a product has to be pretty bad for me to not like it.  I didn't dislike these enough to not eat them (being a hound and all that), but I'd never buy them or accept an offer of one again (and that's saying a lot).

But of course, cats are finicky, so explaining the different intensities of reaction isn't hard. They're cats. I don't know if I'll buy more, because it's sort of pricey as a treat for one of three cats.",4
"We bought a new bread machine to use this mix. Threw out the old one years ago. I gave this bread a bad review after the 1st loaf. Just made the 4th batch, and this bread is worth at least three and a half stars. Here's what we've learned: All ingredients must be at room temperature. The water and milk should be a bit warmer. Follow the directions carefully. It'll actually smell like you're baking bread in the last hour of the process. On second taste, the bread is pretty good. Most bread depends on what you put on it, and this bread is no different. I like the whipped peanut spread. Another favorite: spreadable butter with cinnamon and a sweetener. I'm coming back for a 2nd order. I'm a bread person, and this fits the bill.",2

I liked these candies but not enough for what I paid for them. This is possibly due to the fact that I have never had Japanese candy and this being my first experience I may have gone into this with the wrong mindset. I may  be willing to give these a second chance in the future.,4
This didn't seem to have the flavor that I was accustomed to in the smaller size container.  It is still a good product but just didn't seem as fresh. I have no explanation.,3

"Remember when Vinny had the witness on the stand, he asked if he used instant grits? ""No self respecting Southerner eats those"" was the reply. Its true. These taste OK, but just go for the Old Fashioned Grits, they only take 20 minutes or so to make, and are way better. Its tradition.",2
"Normally my daughter's Pomeranian is fed a diet of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W5U5H6"">Taste of the Wild Dry Dog Food, Hi Prairie Canine Formula with Roasted Bison & Venison, 15-Pound Bag</a>, or another of their variety's of dry dog food.  Thanks to some previous recommendations (a nice chart/web site that compared the various dog food products and rated them based on meat content, grain and other by-product inclusion, etc.), we'd settled on that as one of the better quality products to feed to our furry little friend.  Unfortunately there were issues with a recall related to possible salmonella in the dog food that required taking back one bag of the T.o.t.W. food, but even that was quickly enough resolved by the local store we tend to get her food from (that bag was accepted back for store credit, with me already having obtained a bag of another flavor T.o.t.W. product that wasn't on the recall list), and at this point the recall issues are long resolved for us.<br /><br />To get back on topic, our furry friend crunches through the small handfuls of the T.o.t.W. product about as quickly as we give it to her.  Like most dogs, she has no concept of ""full"" and will eat whatever is put in front of her and then come back for more.  Normally it is probably more correct to say she inhales her food, though I do hear her crunching on each piece so I know she's at least chewing it up before swallowing it.  Trying out a different brand is something we do cautiously as making too drastic a change to the diet seems to wind up providing us a dog that is capable of some pretty nasty biological output of the very odoriferous type (how a smell that potent can be emitted by such a small dog, I don't have a clue, but whew!).  On the other hand though, we do like to offer the dog a variety of food so she can enjoy something different and not just be stuck eating the same old dry food again and again.<br /><br />This Chef Michael's food, a product from Purina, a pet food manufacturer I remember from many, many years ago (back in my youth), sold itself to me in the ""Grilled Sirloin"" name.  Meat in general seems to be a favorite of the family dog, but especially beef flavors, so it seemed an easy assumption that she'd like this product.  In that area, I wasn't wrong.  As I gave her a good sized handful of food in her bowl she pulled out a chunk and went off to the side where she went to work on chewing it up and savoring the taste a bit before she decided it was something she needed to go back to get more of.  Sure enough, that chunk was quickly enough swallowed up and the rest of the bowl was soon emptied.<br /><br />When I put the handful of food in the bowl I noticed that the food itself did seem to resemble pieces of meat.  Definitely not a dry kibble type food, but more along the lines of a moist meat product, perhaps along the side of say a stick of pepperoni or perhaps a Slim Jim (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DT3VHS"">Slim Jim Giant Slim Pepperoni, .97-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a>).  Or, perhaps more along the lines of something I'd expect to see in a beef stew.  In that area, well, lets just say that if there was a category for ""visual"" appeal on the part of the human, this product would get a decent score.  But, well, there's the question of just what is in the product and that is where I'd have to say I'm not as inclined to consider purchasing this product too often.<br /><br />This would seem to be a product that falls more on the lower (half) end of the quality scale when it comes to not being comprised of too many fillers and products that aren't as necessary in a dog's diet.  From past experience in researching what to feed the dog, I'd long ago learned that many of what I'd call lower quality foods are filled with, well, lots of fillers.  While dogs will eat it and not really care, they don't need those fillers and given that it isn't that much more expensive to buy higher quality products, I've tried to keep our pet on a diet that would hopefully be better for her in the longer term.<br /><br />As an occasional change of pace in our dog's diet, I think this would be an ok product.  Perhaps just as a ""treat"" every now and then, but I just don't see myself rushing out to get more bags of this product instead of the Taste of the Wild products, or other products that I tend to have a bit more respect for.",3
"As an energy drink, I don't know how it compares, b/c it's the only energy drink I've ever had.  I bought one from my local ""Entertainment Superstore"" (in Cape Girardeau, Missouri) and drank it and then went back a couple weeks later and bought another to keep on my shelf.  Of all the Ghostbusters merch I've been hoping for, this is a cool trick.  Thankfully they named it appropriately - ""Ectoplasm"".  Thank goodness they didn't come out with a yogurt named that!  I can imagine how many people would...not buy it...anyway; I guess that's about all I've got to say about this non-goopy Ectoplasmic residue...",4
"My son who eats everything, actually refused to eat this baby food.  I got it as a 'spare' for when we're travelling.

Texture wise it is good as  stage-3 food.",2

"This toy was highly recommended by my trainer, so I thought I'd give it a try, desperate to find anything to keep my ""little"" guy (70+ lb Lab mix puppy) and my adult German Shepherd busy for more than a couple minutes.  The first time, the treats stayed in for about an hour but were devoured 5 minutes later.  I then tried the caps with the screw rod in the middle, my puppy had it disassembled and devoured in under 10 minutes (far less time than it took me to assemble).  Went back to the original caps and this time around they too only lasted about 10 minutes before they were completely devoured as well.  Soon after, my puppy had one side torn completely off and reduced to little blue plastic bits.  While both of my dogs really loved it while it lasted, for the price of the toy and the price of the refills (which sell out from my local store so quickly I have a hard time getting them), for my guys, it just wasn't worth it, but for less aggressive chewers, this would be great.",3
"We did a rather unscientific blind taste test and we like Luzianne better. Luzianne tea has a more ""tea"" flavor if you know what I mean. Also, Lipton tea bags come in little paper packets which I think is not useful and wasteful. Lots of my tags were not stapled which was annoying too. Overall, it is okay tea just don't drink Luzianne and then Lipton or you will notice a difference. I bought a lot (since I bought it on Amazon) and it is in no way bad tea, just not as good as Luzianne.",3

I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.,1
"Salty, crunchy, healthy; that's my kind of snack. Except for the high fat content (about half the calories are fat calories) they are really a good addition to a salad or just eat them from the bag. The 2 grams of fiber make up for some of that. I like the original flavor best.",4

"Unless you read the fine print, you won't know that ""Turkey & Chicken Formula"" actually contains turkey, chicken AND whitefish.  Upon opening a can, you immediately get a hint of something fishy--perhaps this is why others have reported the food as ""contaminated"".  After just a single 5.5 oz can, my dog had a serious case of fish breath and by the next day was occasionally passing fishy-smelling gas.  Don't get me wrong---my dog loved this food, and I have read enough reviews to be satisfied that it's very good quality.  I have no doubt he would love to gobble down more of this (and I've got another 23 cans to get through), but I don't think my family will appreciate more of the fishy smell.",3

And while this product is sugar free (sweetened with aspartame), that didn't scare me away as I've enjoyed some other drink products sweeted with aspartame.  Well, I brought my new purchase to work this morning, and brewed my first cup.  The aroma was pleasant ... could smell the apple right away and then a few moments later could smell the caramel.  But then I tasted it - and it was awful!  I sipped it hot, sipped it warm, and even tried another cup with a different amount of water.  I'm done!  The taste is extremely chemical with little to no apple taste (nor caramel).

"Of all the energy solutions out there, this is easily the best one.  However, it still has its drawbacks.<br /><br />First, the PROs -<br /><br />Instant energy - Works almost immediately (within 1 minute for me)<br /><br />Not a lot of ""jitter"" - Many other energy bars and drinks give you that shaky feeling.  This one does not<br /><br />No Crash - Its true, there is no crash.  Though when you come back to your previous energy level, it might feel like a crash.<br /><br />A very positive energy - In addition to the physical energy you also get a very refreshing mental energy.  It can almost be described as a very focused high.  A feeling of clarity and motivation all at once<br /><br />Small amount goes a long way - I like that you dont have to drink a big 16 oz bottle of this stuff.  Most energy drinks have a taste about as appealing as bath water.  So, its nice to only have to drink an oz or two<br /><br />Now, for the CONS<br /><br />Taste - See above<br /><br />Thirst - I get very thirsty on this stuff.  I always have to make sure to have a big bottle of water around<br /><br />Its addictive - The ""mental"" energy you get from this makes you want to do it all over again.  Probably not for people with addictive personalities<br /><br />Big initial blast - The first 10 minutes for me are almost too much.  I seem to want to do everything all at once.

So I went on a Dr. Pepper search. $50 shipping for 24/pk cans... That was not happening, but I bought other things with the goodness of DP flavor... icy pops(yummy btw)and the jerky. The jerky is just jerky...

I read the title then I saw the picture with three packages a little deceiving in my opinion I figured for $20 I was getting three 4oz packages. As far the other review saying the jerky is dry... It's jerky...<br /><br />It is not bad jerky but it doesn't taste like Dr. Pepper, and it is definitely not worth $5/oz. IMHO... live and learn but the DP icy pops are pretty good :)",2

If my supermarket choice was this, Tazo or Good Earth, I'd get this in a second.<br /><br />However, unlike other brands I buy frequently, you can't really see the individual pieces of spices (cardamom pods, arms of star anise). I prefer the more premium teas that have identifiable spices. I did notice more spice/tea dust than usual inside the envelope. More finely powdered teas lose their flavor quicker than the more chunky stuff.<br /><br />If homemade/authentic restaurant chai is a 10, Good Earth a 1, I'd give this a solid 4. (Two Leaves and a Bud Black Chai is an 8, Bombay Chai is a 8, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf is a 6, Stash Double Spice is 6, Tazo is a 3, Bigelow/Twinings are 1s, any premade chai liquid/powder with sugar is a -3).<br /><br />Numi made with Roobios doesn't count on the scale.",3

"Chinese red dates or jujubes have been used in Chinese medicine and diet for a hundreds of years. I recently returned from a trip to China and the Chinese like to serve one or two of these dates along with their meals or even make them part of the stir fry dishes; I believe it improves digestion, among providing other health benefits. During my 2 week China stay, I experienced none of my common Western digestive issues (bloating, constipation, heaviness, low energy) so they must be on to something???<br /><br />These are not meant to be a snack food, stick to 2-3 per day. I like them in my oatmeal in the morning.<br /><br />As for the quality, this is a rather large resealable bag. The dates are pitted and appear fresh.

"Pretty good, but I actually prefer ""Fluffy Stuff"" as the best packaged cotton candy I've tried.  That tastes better, and has a better and finer texture.  The description containing the information that the various colors are fruit flavored is somewhat buried and I unfortunately missed it when I purchased this.  Pink is the nondescript, just-sweet flavor I like.  I don't detect any fruity flavor, just maybe slight vanilla.  The blue (berry) however tastes like cough syrup and the yellow (pina colada supposedly) is pretty gross to me.  I've had a few bags that were all pink and those are pretty good.  I honestly do not enjoy the mixed ones nearly as much and neither do the kids.  Also, there are large, sharp fragments of sugar that irritate the tongue/mouth as does the coarseness of the candy.  There are occasional hard chunks that look like moisture got in.",3
"I had high hopes when I opened the tin and was greeted by the aroma of tea and oil of Bergamot.  The aroma of this tea is just spectacular.  Unfortunately, the taste doesn't live up to the smell.

From now on I'll stick with the foil-wrapped Bigelow earl gray teabags from my local grocery store, which don't smell as good but which taste much better than this tea.",3
"Although the 1.5 Liter size is a bit too large to carry around conveniently, the water does taste good. What I liked about it was that it was not carbonated, it was smooth, and it did not leave an aftertaste.<br /><br />I really don't think that the pH of water is going to change your overall body health, but many like to think that the water they are drinking is pure and free of nonessential elements. The makers claim that Essentia has a special electrolyte formula but it is difficult to analyze this without a comparative chemical analysis.<br /><br />The important thing to remember is that getting plenty of fluid is very important to overall hydration. It is felt that water is the preferred fluid (vs soda, coffee, tea, alcohol, flavored drinks, gatorade, etc.) Drinking the proper amount of water, in addition to other beverages in moderate amounts, every day will help you to be more healthy and lose or maintain weight so make sure you know how much you need!<br /><br />Instructions to determine basic overall fluid need per day:<br /><br />  1)  Weigh yourself and write down your weight.<br />  2)  Take the number of pounds you weigh and multiply that by 2/3.<br />  3)  That is the number of ounces you should drink everyday. The conversion is: 30 mL to one ounce.<br />  4)  For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, two thirds of that is 100 and that is how many ounces you should drink daily. So that would be 3000 mL or 3 Liters of FLUID.<br />  5)  Add 12 ounces of water for every 30 minutes you work out.<br /><br />If you are under the care of a health care professional or have conditions that alter your fluid need from the average person, please seek advice.<br /><br />So, if drinking this particular brand of water helps to make sure you have adequate fluid intake because you like it more than tap water or other bottled water -- go for it!",4

"I love this salt!!  The delivery was quick, the price was reasonable and the salt imparts a wonderful flavor to everything I eat!  And, it doesn't burn my tongue!  I will be using this salt for ever more!",5
"This is very similar in flavor to Kusmi St. Petersburg, although St. Petersburg is far superior in complexity of flavor. Ultimately, I find Paris to be a little boring.<br /><br />I've noticed that the caffeine in Paris makes me feel jittery for some reason. I drink black tea every morning and don't have this problem with other brands. Not sure why Paris seems intensely caffeinated in comparison.<br /><br />For those who'd like to try this tea without breaking the bank, I've found Paris and other selections at The Fresh Market for just $5.99. My local grocery store carries a few flavors as well, all for around $6. H&S Dragon Pearl Jasmine is my favorite from this line.<br /><br />If you're willing to shell out $15-20 for a tea, try Kusmi instead.",3
"I have never met a Kettle brand chip I did not like. These chips have a great loaded potato flavor, which are flavorful. I like the sweet onion chips better, but these are also at the top of the list for great-tasting potato chips. Kettle chips are great chips f/the money!",5
I would never buy this cocoa ever again. this was by far the foulest substance to ever cross my lips. DONT BUY THIS<br />no stars,1
"I did not like the tofu spaghetti.  It did not taste like spaghetti to me.  I thought it would take on the taste that I would cook it in. I tried extreme garlic and spaghetti sauce, but I couldn't eat it.  It got here very quickly and was packaged very well though.",2
"I bought these on an impulse at the store, thinking they would be amazing. I had tried toasts and crackers similar to this brand (in theory).<br /><br />They were horrid, I couldn't eat them by themselves, and they were too hard, crumbly, and over flavored. I attempted to eat them with laughing cow cheese spread and it didn't work, the taste was still nasty.<br /><br />In the end the only way I was able to them was by dipping them in soup like regular toast, and even then they were hardly bearable, or dipping them in cheese soup or fondue.<br /><br />I would suggest skipping them, they are a waste of time and money, unless you like hard, crumbly, oily, over flavored chips.",1
"I normally only drink Starbucks coffee.  so when I stumbled onto this, I was quite skeptical.  By no means am I a java snob, but I am very particular about the kinds of coffee that goes in my mouth.  The Community French Roast really surprised me.  It's flavor is bold, aromatic and fresh. It honestly rival that of Starbucks and Peet's. I have purchased more and so grateful for the amazon members' reviews.",5
"Wow, these chips bite back. I loves me some salt and pepper potato chips, but these have little bit too much spice for my liking. Also, the portion is a little too much. If you like spice, then dive in.",2
"TRUE, Puck's Organic Soups are a bit high in salt,<br />but that aside, they are a staple in our home during Winter.<br />I order several cases pre-Winter or mid-Winter. The Barley and Lentil are<br />my husband's favorites, but he heartily eats the others.",4
"It's not marketed as including conditioners, but my hair feels like it does after using a conditioner.  So if you have fine, thin hair, you may not want to use this, as conditioners will weigh your hair down.<br /><br />I like it.  A little bit gives a lot of lather.  The scent is clean and pleasant, not perfumey.  It's too early to tell if it will really strengthen my hair.  I'm doubtful, because I'm older (67) and my hair has been thinning for years.<br /><br />I don't see that my results are much different from my regular shampoo (Pantene), but I'll probably switch.  It does make more lather than Pantene, so I'll be able to use less, and I like the light conditioning.  The ingredients list several natural oils, so maybe that's where the conditioning comes from.<br /><br />Five stars because it lathers nicely, rinses clean, and smells good.  There's not much more to ask from a shampoo.",5
"When fat is removed from a food, sugar is often added to replace lost flavor.  This dressing has 9g of carbs...more than regular dressings!  Avoid low fat when you're looking for low carb.<br /><br />The seller needs to remove this product from the low carb category.  And all the other low fat dressings which are erroneously listed in low carb.",1
"I've never had an allergic reaction to any food, or anything else, in my life.  But within 20 seconds of starting to chew a piece of this gum, my throat began to burn and my airway became constricted.  That's strange, because I've been chewing spearmint and peppermint ice cubes for a while now with no reaction.  I ""tasted"" another piece from another pack (we get this stuff free at the dining facility here in Iraq), and again, my throat started burning.  So, if you have a history of food allergies, you might not want to try this flavor.",1
"I am not sure on what planet this would be considered cheddar flavored popcorn, but I can assure you it's not on the planet Earth.  It has a bizarre oily flavor that has a bit of a twang to it.  I can't describe it except to say it is not cheddar or any other kind of cheese and it's not good.  In fact it's really rather gross.  No one in my family enjoyed it and after popping one bag, the rest are headed for their final resting place in some garbage dump somewhere.<br /><br />Cherise Everhard, October 2010",1
"Our Great Pyrenees has to take antibiotics for three weeks and figured out the cheese trick after a few tries.  So I bought these, and he chewed the greenie and spit the pill out.  His mother will down almost any food without swallowing, but my dog insists on chewing, therefore, he finds the pill.  Waste of money.<br /><br />If your dog is a ""chewer"", I'd think twice.",1
"I decided to try the Lavazza blue pack (Crema e Gusto) instead of the one that I had found to be perfect in Europe, the Red pack or Lavazza Rossa. I like it but not as much as the Rossa. For my taste it is a little too mocha flavored and I prefer the more robust cafe espresso flavor of the red pack. The price for either coffee is very competetive, particularly if you take advantage of the subscription ordering option. I will be switching back to the Lavazza Rossa.",4
"The Flavor is good but the ""Chowder"" is just a thin soup.  I expect something a little little thicker from a Chowder.  We ended up buying additional clams to add to this product.  Could have used some more vegetable also.",3
"I bought this product as an alternative to nutella since it's dairy-free, and even the cashier said it was the same if not better tasting, but maybe she was talking about the original formula. This spread tastes kind of dry, and not too sweet. It's also really salty, so much that it burns the roof of my mouth. I would not recommend this product at all.",3
"I purchased this tea on the recommendation from a friend, and because I wanted a flavorful pick me up in the afternoon - I ordred the 100 bags and when it came in - it said caffiene free - and it says it is a product you cannot return - so something to keep in mind if you are looking for a pick me up",2
"My cat normally loves tuna and salmon but hated this one. Not too moist, and no gravy at all. Looks like fish as stated but is too dry for her to eat it easily.",2
"The contents just taste like plastic. Not even a little bit of coconut taste. Just plastic. Luckily for me, unlike some reviewers, I only bought 3 bottles. I got through the first one by chugging it, because I hate being wasteful. I left the second and third in the refrigerator at work until someone stole them. I'm sure they regret it.",1
"I tried this product to see if I could make creamy, starbucks quality spiced chai at home and was underwhelmed.  A much better product is provided through Mocafe, Precious Divinity Spiced Chai powdered mix.",3

"I've really enjoyed these cookies, and came to Amazon as this one is hard to find. Much to my SHOCK the price is 60+ dollars.. and it shows they used to be 30.00 and some change? Huh?? Other cookies by Murray are more reasonable. No way will I buy them at this incredible markup :-P",2
"This isn't a review of the product per se, but a warning about the listing: It says that it comes out to 19 cents/ounce at regular price, and 16 cents/ounce with Subscribe & Save. If this is really for 4 12-ounce boxes (so 48 ounces), then those numbers are completely wrong (too low). With Subscribe & Save, it comes out 28 cents/ounce.",2
"Unlike the other reviewer's dog, mine loves ""Newman's Own"" canned food.  I gotta believe that if a dog won't touch this, the dog is not only extremely fussy, but not very hungry as well.  Having this delivered to my door cheaper than I can buy it at my local supermarket sure is handy.",4
"This makes a tasty lunch, and it's a good price if you get this on subscribe & save.  It's 410 calories with 12g fiber and 24g protein.  There are also 18g of fat.  If it's your entire lunch, the numbers are great.  And this is quite filling if you wait a few minutes after eating.  (I eat quickly and sometimes don't realize I'm full.)  The hummus and crackers are pretty good.  I mix the fruit & nut mix with the edamame because I don't like the edamame alone.  I kinda wish the chocolate bar was bigger, but it's probably an actual serving.  Darn.<br /><br />Quite good.",4
"I will order Puffins because I have tried it and it is only at Target here.  PLEASE DO NOT DISCONTINUE THE PLAIN.  I don't like fruit, honey, peanutbutter, cinnanamon or other flavored cereal, but like puffs.  I have trouble with alot of cereal because of dentures.  For years and years I got Quaker Corn Bran but they added cinnamon and I don't like it.  Of, course, I want fiber, low sugar, calories.  Thank you",5
"I thought it would be nice to have a change of the tuna and salmon cans I take to the office for lunch, but this doesn't do it. I bought a 4-pack and opened them all within a week, just to use them up. Too mushy, mouth feel isn't solid enough. Maybe I was expecting too much. Convenient, of course, and organic is important.  I still like the concept.",2
I did not like these beans and won't be purchasing them again.  They were bland (even after adding salt and jalapeno peppers).  They also had a weird aftertaste.,3
"This was my favorite chocolate bar for years.  It was so bold and flavorful.  Then, I tasted the ""new"" recipe.  It is waxy and flavorless.  I didn't even finish the bar.  That never happens at my house!  Do they really think we won't notice?  Well, now I am searching for another good chocolate bar.",1
I like it  thou it bites a little  wroth a try,3
Got this as a gift. It came late. The ice pack it shipped with was completely warm when it arrived days late. Some of the candy was expired- Cherrymash expired about a week ago. 2 candies listed were not included- zagnut bar and moon pie. Most of the box is either gum or hard candy/taffy. I would not spend the money myself and I feel bad that my friend did!,1

"These candies are filled with pecans, NOT cashews, and were very skimpy on the caramel, too.  Chocolate and pecans are cheap ingredients, while cashews and caramel the more expensive.  If you're looking for real cashew turtles with lots of gooey caramel, these are not it.  I guess they just assumed you couldn't tell the difference between pecans and cashews.  p.s. the product label was a real exercise in obfuscation if not downright illegal.  ""This product may or may not contain some or all of the following ingredients.""  You could put that sticker on just about anything.  Not one word of which was cashews.",1
"We bought this stuff on occasion (loved it) for quite some time, but now it has changed.  Bought some recently and found it to be very mild and tasteless.  Used almost the whole jar!  Still no flavor.  Thought something was wrong and bought a jar a few months later, someplace else.  Same result.  Won't buy again, have tried another brand (A Taste of Thai brand Curry Paste, available in 4 different flavors), will stick with that.  Liked that this came in a nice sized jar, versus a packet, but without flavor, what's the point?  Hope this is helpful...",2

"I tried several different flavors of Mentos gum, but was rather disappointed by the overall product.<br /><br />First of all, the good points. The gum comes in a hard, durable container, which is easy to carry around in one's pants pocket, and also facilitates dispensing. Additionally, I like the initial texture of the gum, as it has a hard exterior shell and a soft chewy interior core, which immediately releases a burst of flavoring. Lastly, the texture and consistency of the gum is maintained throughout the mastication process.<br /><br />Now, the bad part. The biggest drawback is that the flavor only lasts at most a few minutes, necessitating me to eat several pieces at once in order to maintain any semblance of lasting mint flavor. Compared to other rival brands such as Dentyne or Eclipse, this is unacceptable. I'm not interested in chewing a piece of bland plastic after just 2-3 minutes. Some have also commented that the hard container makes too much noise in one's pants pockets when walking around.<br /><br />In summary, the Mentos are best used as an ephemeral breath mint, rather than a long-lasting gum.<br /><br />Now in regards to this particular flavor of red fruit lime, I find that the flavor lasts slightly longer as compared to the mint flavor.  Still not long enough, but just a smidgeon longer.  Additionally, the packaging is deceptive, because the core of the gum is most certainly not green colored.",3
"When I initially ordered this Whiskas Perfectly Chicken for my cats, they liked it OK. They did not wolf it down, but they would eat it without complaint.<br /><br />THE FELINE EEDING SCENARIO AT MY HOME:<br /><br />My Kitties always have kibble out and eat that freely. In the moring the two of them share one can of wet food and in the evening, each cat gets his own can or pouch.<br /><br />I rotate their wet food meals so that they do not have a constant diet of any one flavor of Product. I have had cats all my life and if there is one thing I deal poorly with, it is ""THE LOOK FROM THE CAT which says ""Are you out of your mind? Have you lost your senses? Were you born yesterday? Do YOU NOT RECALL that I Do Not Care for That?"" It can, of course, be that this attitude has developed onvernight and I am to be a cat whisperer/mind reader and know this ahead of time. But I hate that whole scenario. In my opinion, I have two overly spoiled cats who live in the lap of luxury with cat trees, cat condos, cat toys, and dry and wet cat food! Water too! Their buddy, whom I feed also, is a feral kitty and he dang well eats what there is. There is no THE LOOK from him. So I try, at all costs, to avoid THE LOOK!<br />To that end, the cats are offered a variety of wet foods. Kibble is a constant, but I try to make the wet food a treat and a time of relaxation and enjoyment. So, the Purfectly Chicken was offered about two times a week. Other varieties and other flavors were offerred at other times.<br />I put the Purfectly Chicken on ""Subscibe and Save"" and had it delivered every three months, so I know they were not overwhelmed with this food. But after 6 months, the noses went up and I got THE LOOK. So, I took the Chicken off ""Subscribe and Save"" for a year or more. Then, I was looking for something ""different"" to order and saw the Chicken on my old list and decided to try it again. No dice. One pouch of the plain chicken and I got THE LOOK. A couple of weeks later, I sneaked in the Chicken and Beef:  THE LOOK. Well, the feral cat really, really likes the Chicken and Duck, but I can't be buying special stuff just to keep him happy. He will have to stick with the large cans of Friskies (except of course when I feel sorry for him and sneak in the Purfectly Chicken after a run to the local grocery store).<br />So, I gave The Purfectly Chicken a fair shot with my kitties. It just isn't something they like. No accounting for taste! But, since they seem to live in their own happy, finicky world, they have told me to give Purfectly Chicken only three stars. They say they would eat it if they were truly Starving, but, hopefully, we won't have that happen and will just continue to accommodate their wishes with other wet foods.<br /><br />On the positive side, Mr. Feral Kitty has been living in my back yard for four years. (It is his choice to remain outdoors and living the wild life. But, he has progressed to the point that he appears at the back door at 5:00 PM and patiently waits until 5:30. Past that time, he begins to cry and let me know that he IS HUNGRY!) He eats once a day. His vote for Purfectly Chicken is 5 Stars. (He likes it because of the great amount of gravy and the large chunks of real meat.)<br /><br />So I have split the difference and given the product 4 Stars. Two cats give me THE LOOK. One cat really enjoys this product. If your cat is a true Chicken Lover, I believe he or she will like it quite well.<br /><br />Just FYI: My two spoiled kitties have decided that they prefer ProPlan which has Some Gravy and Small Chunks of food. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003R0LLYY"">Pro Plan Canned Cat Food, Adult Salmon and Rice Entr&eacute;e In Sauce (Pack of 24 3 Ounce Cans)</a> I am well trained enough to realize that they do not care for Pate!<br /><br />I happens to be December 2011 as I am writing this, so I wish each of you a Blessed Holiday Season and and a Happy New Year!

"I am a peanut butter lover. I love Skippy Super Chunk, which I had been buying at the grocery.  But I wanted a larger quantity, so I purchased these large jars.  However, I don't know if they are old but it is no where near as creamy as I am used to getting in the stores.  Pretty disappointed.",2

It's nearly impossible to find microwave popcorn that isn't manufactured with hydrogenated oil and so I pop fresh Orville Reddenbacher popcorn with this popping oil.  Popping corn fresh gives a fresher taste and I can control the additives, like this healthy butter flavored alternative oil.  Great product!",4
"I ordered Black Truffle oil and got the white instead which I do not like as much. This however is smooth for its lower price which is nice.

"The pet food store gave me five different samples so I thought I'd let Louie, my standard poodle, make the decision. I put the five samples in five bowls.

"I bought this at the same time I bought the Wire Tek ""EasySet"" Mole Trap here on Amazon, and after trying both products I have to say that the Victor ""Out O'Sight"" Mole Trap is not only 1) much more difficult to operate but also 2) less effective than the Wire-Tek one, not to mention 3) tears up your yard more.  With this Victor brand one you actually have to dig a hole by hand vs. with the Wire-Tek one all you do is push it in to the ground and step on it to set it, easy as pie.  That one has caught 2 moles for me so far, the Victor trap has caught 0 moles.  If it wasn't such a hassle to ship stuff back, I'd return this one and buy another Wire Tek brand mole trap.  Don't waste your time on this product here!",2

I'm not normally a chocolate lover.  While in Germany I got hooked on these bringing dozens home with me.  The chocolate is sooo much better there.  I was excited to see them for sale here.  But very disappointed that the bars here didn't taste like the ones in Germany.  It tastes like US white chocolate not European.<br /><br />I guess it's like how some products are different between the US and Canada.  (Ever try Canadian Oreos?  Even better than the US ones!)<br /><br />Disclaimer: The US product I tried was not from Amazon.  I'm confident that Amazon is selling the same American version though.

Several hours after eating them, my pointer had a rumbly stomach that was so loud I could hear it and she was rolling around, obviously uncomfortable. My shitzu started vomiting and had terrible diahrrea. He did not eat for a full day and threw up everything, even the water he drank. He was a very sick little dog! It was sad to see my dogs so miserable because of something I had given them. I do not reccommend giving these to your dog!",1

I was already a seriously lengthy water drinker and this made no difference to my milk production.  I am convinced that my epidural screwed my chances of breastfeeding easily.  I used pumps, which obviously work better than baby... but, even then my milk wasn't what it should have been.

I do not have the original bag so cannot tell for sure if my item was recalled but the date it was purchased coincides with the manufacturing dates of the recalled product.

"Have ordered this delicious nutritious salmon through the Subscribe and Save program for awhile now, which would be a good deal except almost every shipment has contained dented cans, as many as 50% of the order. Interestingly enough, the dented cans have their dented sides facing the center of the packaging and cannot be seen until the tight plastic wrap is cut open and the cans removed. Am looking into whether or not I can return a partial shipment. I'm not sure what the FDA says about dented canned food but my background in food service makes me unwilling to risk it, especially with seafood. If the issue can be resolved I'd love to continue buying it through this otherwise cost-effective and convenient program -LOVE stocking my home pantry and rotating my earthquake stash through Amazon Subscribe and Save!",5

After trying many brands of canned foods, this is one of the few that they eagerly eat, and it doesn't smell as bad as some.",4

I guess my palate needed to acclimate to it ... but now that it has it is difficult to stop drinking it long enough to type in my thoughts about it.<br /><br />The coconut melds beautifully with the sweet flavor of the matcha.  Both are creamy, sweet flavors and together they create something that is beyond creamy and sweet ... it's absolutely scrumptious!",4
"These oat clusters were good for snacking as well as for breakfast.  While they are touted as clusters, I found that they broke into sub-clusters too quickly (i.e. they turned into something better eaten with a spoon rather than with fingers).  Great on its own or mixed with milk or plain yogurt.  The list of ingredients places the product squarely in the ""actually natural"" vs. the ""marketed as natural"" category.  Good stuff.",4
"Well.. after I've read the reviews .. I had great expectations BUT.. as a result.. the product is not bad.. bag to big for the amount of granola inside, if you know what I mean  ;-)<br /> Price is ok but I know I can get a better and/or bigger product for the same amount USD I paid.<br />Conclusion -  not bad but I would select another brand",3
"Twinings is one of the worst English breakfast teas you can buy.  Most serious tea drinkers know and understand that Twinings lacks aroma and strength, and if you open a tea back you'll find tea ground to the consistency of sawdust--terrible stuff.  I can't believe there are so many 5 star reviews.  I'll wager the Twinnings company mounted a campaign and got people to write favorable reviews.",1
"I have two 13-20 pound dogs (Yorkie-Poodle and Chihuahua-Doxie mixes) and these treats are perfect for their size.  The look and smell like dehydrated apricot with banana.  If I didn't know they were dog food, I could be fooled.<br /><br />The only thing that wasn't mentioned in the description is the place of manufacturing.  I would feel more comfortable with their claim of ""natural"" and ""healthy"" if I knew where they were made.<br /><br />Edit:  Once you open the package, you should put them in the refrigerator, as a previous reviewer stated.  I found that one of the pieces had gone bad (which, in turn, shows that they have very few preservatives).",4
Great service; great product<br /><br />Cannot always find in local stores.  So convenient and cost effective to order by the case!,5
"The coffee is good but the price is ridiculous($1.25 each K-cup approx).  You can get it from Green Mountain for 75 cents a K-cup (delivered) which is still too much. Buy it for 60 cents a K-cup at Bed, Bath and Beyond or Kohls.",1
"I believe the product would be excellent if it had the right packaging for shipping; other than losing over half the contents of the m&m""s due to combustion caused by poor packaging care what was left was edible for the children even though I wasn't able to use it for its original purpose",3
I inquired with the seller if this salt was unprocessed sea salt and they had no clue.  I was very disappointed but should have known it was processed by the whiteness of the product. Unprocessed sea salt retains all the natural occuring minerals from the sea which is why it appears speckled and beige (gray if Celtic). However when it get processed those sea minerals that gives it that speckling effect are stripped away making it no different than the mineral empty table salt you find on most grocer shelves for 30 cents.,2
"These candy bars are wonderful. When I go to upstate New York I put up with 45 minute waits at the border (in each direction) just to buy this candy. It has a wonderful coffee flavor, and its very light. I wish they would market this candy bar again in the US",5
"I normally import my Weetabix all the way from England (being from England myself, Weetabix was always a firm favorite of mine for breakfast), so was delighted when I saw Amazon were selling it at a much better price.<br /><br />I had hoped that Weetabix is Weetabix, and taste wouldn't differ too much even if the product was made by a different company.  This product is made by some company in America, and it did taste different to the brand I typically buy from England.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn't like it.  It had a strange flavor that just didn't appeal to me.  I'm sure it's a preference thing though, and there will be plenty of people who like this just as much (or maybe even better than) the British alternative.  I, however, will be going back to importing my Weetabix from England.",2
"When I bought this (11/1/10), this product was called Broadway Basketeers Sympathy Gift Tower of Sweets (Large). I see it's  now called ""...Hanukkah Gift Tower...."" In any case, we had a death in the family, so this seemed an appropriate gift. The recipient said it was exciting to open each individually wrapped box and they enjoyed the contents. Unfortunately, the gift message I wrote with my order wasn't anywhere in or on the product or package. So, during this stressful time, the recipient and their family had to make many phone calls to various family members to try to identify who had sent it. I felt terrible. I definitely didn't want to put any more stress on them.",4
"I've been Ordering another brand for years now, but wanted to switch it up a bit and see what other products are out there.  This brand appealed to me because it cuts back considerably of packaging and waste.  The tea as a green tea is suitable, it tastes pretty standard.  The only problem is that there isn't really any mint flavor to speak of.",3
"My cats have rejected Tuna and Chicken Chuckles, but I'm only docking it one point for that because I don't think it is the food's fault. It looks just fine, mostly red tuna mixed with shreds of chicken, (there is way more tuna than chicken, the chicken shreds are almost like a condiment). My cats like other flavors of BFF, they just wolfed down a plate of Tuna Too Cool for dinner, but they do not like this one. I've tried feeding it to them several times and they just don't like it. One of them ate a bit of Tuna & Chicken Chuckles and threw it up and the other just refused to touch it. My cats are really picky, though. I'll donate the rest of the case of this to my local shelter where I'm sure the kitties will find it a glorious treat and get my feline food critics something else.",4
"...you can absolutely forget about these. Confirmed by other reviewers, these chips are now total garbage. Like chewing on styrofoam packaging ""peanuts"". Positively awful, no hyperbole or exaggeration. I'll NEVER buy anything from Kettle brand ever again! From a reportedly once great ""premium"" brand, literally any mass market chip I've ever tried tastes better than these. Stale and rancid tasting, and virtually no salty taste whatsoever. Completely awful!",1
"i am really glad that i found this product. our household watches carbs very closely and this makes it even easier. my only wish is that it could be on auto ship, but that isnt offered.",5
"I was given some of this candy as a gift and liked it so much I wanted to share some with my family members during the holidays.  I ordered this bag from Amazon. When the bag came, I open it up as I found the bag a bit wore looking. I did not mind too much as I was going to create little bags out of the large bag. I ended up eating one... I glad I did. I was saved from giving a poor gift to my daughters.<br /><br />Found the inside of the ball had a large hole with only half of the smooth cream stuff the other candies had. Tried few more and found the same thing.  I ended up taking the candies to school and let my students have one on the last day before Christmas break... They all found the same thing.  Some had NO center of the cream at all. While the candy tasted ok - they were not the kind of candy I was looking for and were of a poor and inferior made.<br /><br />Would I buy this again?  NO WAY!",2
"Wow, I was surprised to read the other reviews here.  After doing extensive research on this and other dry and wet foods, I found Newman's Organic to be one of the highest quality available.<br /><br />I was disturbed over the number of cancer deaths in both dogs and cats occurring each year.  The numbers keep going up and I figured it must be related to their diets.  This food uses human grade natural chicken (no hormones, antibiotics, pesticides) in both their canned and dry food.<br /><br />I wish this listing had the Nutrition Facts, but if you go to newmansownorganics dot com and read the FAQs you will learn a great deal about pet nutrition.  My cat loves this stuff and had no trouble with the transition from its old food.  She also loves the canned food.",5
"I received this by error from amazon instead of the organic pasta.  I accepted it because it said organic on the front and I didn't look very carefully at it.  I discovered later that the pasta was organic, but the cheese was not.  A bit misleading!",1
Cheddar cheese popchips have 3 to 4 grams of fat and taste better than the real thing!  Highly recommended.,5
I got very old product i mean about to expiry. I can smell the cereal inside is stinky. I wouldn't buy this item from amazon. i know this cereal is very good where i got from my local grocery store,1
Not happy with the product.  Once they were cooked the potatoes were flat and didn't look any thing like the product picture that was seen.  The shipping cost as much as the potatoes did!,1
"The product description is deceptively incomplete. Other Crystal Light flavors come in packages containing multiple packets such as the other items in my order and indicate a total volume produced when all of the packets are mixed (5 packets per 3.4 ounce package makes 10 quarts of the Ruby Red drink) but they can be mixed to make just 2 quarts at a time. I expected that, similar to the Ruby Red mix, since they were by the same manufacturer, the Strawberry Kiwi mix would come in packets that, when all were mixed would produce 2 gallons (4 packets per 1.9 ounce package makes 8 quarts [2 gallons] of the Strawberry Kiwi drink) and that they, too could be mixed 2 quarts at a time. No where in the text was it indicated that each package had to be fully used and did not contain individual packets. If a photo had been available which there was not, I could have seen that the packages were drastically different and I would have known that they were not like the ones in previous orders.<br /><br />I like the flavor of the product but having to make 2 gallons at a time is cluttering up my refrigerator.",3
"tasty, sweet, smooth, savory, refreshing.  a good, middle of the road, coffee beverage.  There was nothing I didn't like about it, yet nothing that really stood out.  Would I buy it again? Maybe.",3
"I was enticed by the cool design - less trash is good. The price obviously was also very enticing.<br />When the coffee arrived, I carefully transferred the pods to a plastic ziploc bag.<br />So far, so good. I then proceeded to brew my first cup - all excited to have found something wonderful.<br />Well, the excitement ceased when the cup produced was pure black liquid with a flavor that was not pleasing to my palate - at all. Maybe if you like bitterness in a coffee without the pleasantness of a well-rounded rich coffee, then this is for you.<br />I found it not an experience to be repeated. I tried to like this coffee, but will go back to another brand. Sorry San Francisco Bay Coffee company - I really tried. The decaf French Roast was even less likable...",1
"I found these for much less ($2.50 + $2.55) at two other places here on amazon, do not buy from here, free shipping not worth it",1
"You either Like Tim Burton or you don't,I fall in the latter.BeetleJuice is not a big deal for me despite it's huge following and Burton's Following,While there are funny moments I am not the type to like Alice In Wonderland type films that are ""trippy"".I think the Highlight for Me Is Robert Goulet(Goulet!robert gouleeeeeeeeet!)and Wionna Ryder,I can't stand Baldwin.",1
"After reading the reviews I was itching to get my hands on these as the ones I had<br />were a couple of years old but kept sealed, so they were OK.<br />If you keep Pistachios sealed they last a very, very long time.<br />The new Pistachios did not taste much better than my two year old ones.<br />Nuff said",3
"Cats are a finicky bunch, mine in particular. On the plus side she isn't interested in people food, on the not-so-plus side she turns her nose up to almost everything I buy for her to eat. With that in mind it was a small miracle when she actually ate these the first time I gave them to her and then looked up and asked for more. I can't comment on how well they work on keeping her teeth clean but I can say if they do work as advertised I'm more than pleased with the product.  I have tried those other products and my cat has no interest in them. I will buying more of these.",5
"We have a picky puppy.  After doing a lot of research on dog food, I chose Eagle Pack.  We tried for 2-3 days, but our puppy just wasn't interested in this food.  We ended up getting him on Taste of the Wild Puppy, which he loves.  Eagle Pack is a great company, thats made great food for a long time, at a great price.  Our dog just wasn't digging it though...",3
Tried to give these treats to two different dogs.  Both did not like it and would not eat it.,1
"Happy to find these dried Cherries but upon adding them to my yogurt I discover they are sugared!  What a disappointment.  Dug them out of the yogurt and will be taking the rest of the bag back to Costco for a refund.  Same goes for their dried Blueberries.  The fact they have been sugared should be on the front of the package.  I notice that in the product descriptors on Amazon, no mention is even made about the huge fact that they are sugared.  I feel the  omission misleading and Amazon is just begging for returns.",1
"This is probably one of the best flavored coconut waters out there.  It tastes like skinny chocolate milk.  If you are concerned about the level of sugar, though, you should stay away.  It is has 18 grams per serving whereas most plain only has about 12. Although, if you drink it before or after a grueling Bikram practice, I think you deserve a little extra sugar.",4
"From what I heard, the basket was nice and delivered on time but the recipient had no idea who sent it. Despite my well worded thank you note (the gift was a small token of appreciation)that I had entered in the appropriate box on the order form, there was nothing included. The recipient eventually called Amazon and found out who had sent it.  This was embarrassing and a let down on what good service I have grown to expect from Amazon.",4
"Given that these have almost exactly the same ingredients as my favorite candy Wine Gums, I was hoping they would be nice. But they taste pretty artificial, and the texture has no chew to it. Fine if you like that sort of thing, but I was disappointed.<br /><br />They are slightly redeemable if you let them sit open for a couple weeks, so I gave two stars. Still, I'll never buy them again; I'll stick to gummy bears and wine gums for my rare candy indulgences.",2
"HI,<br /><br />Thanks for the consistent good service.  Product is excellent.  Repeat customer for all flavors.",5
"Although I am not a tea expert, but I do drink tea daily (not from tea bags).<br /><br />This tea is not the worst that I ever had, but for the price I can only rate it one star. The flavor is too mild or weak. From what I can tell, this should not even be classified as oolong tea.",1
"This product is packaged in plastic bottles.  I buy all of my spices, extracts, etc. in glass containers only. I would not have ordered this had I known it was shipped in plastic bottles. Because the price was low, we discarded the un-opened plastic bottles rather than try to return them.",1
"Sorry, but not like I thought they would be. No one in the family thought they tasted anything like what they claimed to be like.",2
I originally bought these to help get my husband's cholesterol down.  This is another method to get in oatmeal without having to make a hot cereal.  I even pack them as a quick breakfast on the go.  The Chocolate Brownie and Cranberry are our favorite varieties.,4
"and not such a good smell did try tyson was way better would not order it again , just wished to get more dark meat chicken with low sodium",3
"I found microwave pork rinds quite by accident. But ever since, they are something I have wanted. Now I found them on Amazon, and I couldn't be happier.<br /> It's a quick, easily prepared snack, and as other reviewers have pointed out, not bad for your diet.<br /> Once they come put of the microwave, open the bag, pour them out, and marvel as you hear them still popping and crackling in the bowl. I may never go back to bagged pork rinds ever again",5
"My cat loves this stuff, and would order a case but paying over $18 for shipping is ridiculous. Their total price makes this stuff almost twice the 89 cents that this is available for at the corner store. Keep shopping.",1
"Original review -- I thought I had purchased salt with almonds in it. The amount of salt is RIDICULOUS and very unhealthy. Almonds are a healthy snack but not if they are this salty.<br /><br />UPDATE -- I contacted the company and they provided a replacement. The new bag was perfect, the almonds were tasty and not too salty. It seems that I purchased a bag from a bad batch. The company was prompt at correcting the problem. I originally gave the product a 1 star rating, I'm updating the review and giving the product 4 stars.",4
"Not sure how I feel about the product, Murray Sugar Free Cookies. My disappointment is with Amazon for sending EXPIRED COOKIES. After notifying Amazon I received an apology email and a new delivery was sent to recipent. I was shocked to receive a second call from the recepient that the 2nd delivery was also EXPIRED having the same expiration date as the first delivery. Next thing I know I receive an email from Amazon my money is being refunded. Have no idea what happened. I was embarrassed and disappointed the first time. Imagine my embarrassment the second time. The recepient is a diabetic and loves Murray Sugar Free Cookies but she is only able to find Shortbread in our stores and Peanut Butter is her favorite.",3
"I received one packet as a sample and followed the directions. All you have to do is pour hot water over the contents and serve. I split it with my daughter to get her input on flavor,and neither of liked the flavor at all. We both love ginger and lemon, and can even handle strong tea brewed from fresh ginger. It had a strange medicinal flavor, and was sweetened somehow, but the package had no ingredient list and no other information whatsoever. The lack of information with the sample had me considering tossing it into the trash since I always like to know exactly what I'm using. Without information, I decided to base my rating on taste alone. The lemon was mild, and I assume the sweetener was honey. It wasn't too sweet, nor was the ginger too strong, but that outstanding medicine/fake taste was overwhelming. It did dissolve easily, and it's nice not to have a tea bag to deal with, but not worth it when it tastes so bad. If you like ginger for its health benefits, take a piece of fresh ginger, cut it into a few pieces, and boil in a pan to desired taste. Add lemon and honey also to taste and you're set.",2
Originally I was very happy when I received this beautiful little tree ... unfortunately it seemed under-potted and root bound so it died within the first month.  I drew the root bound conclusion as I made one final attempt to save it by re-potting the tree into a bigger dish with new soil but the roots were already dark brown and just a tangled mess to deal with ... I have left the tree in the new soil and water it occasionally ... as of yet no signs of life have returned.,2
"The coffe is really great, makes very aromatic, full bodied espresso.  I would just like to review the packaging more. I ordered several packs of these, packaged in bricks of 4, vacuum-packed, and covered with clear plastic. Very impressed because of the efficiency of packaging, very tightly packed. Of the 3 sets I ordered,  one set had one of the bricks with a punch hole at the bottom, seems mysterious since the clear plastic covering the 4 bricks was in no way punched and remained intact. It's just the one brick with the punch hole at the bottom. I wonder how it got that way. Anyway, this would have been 5-stars but for that. Highly recommend the coffee.",4
Carosel does not rotate freely even when empty & this is the 2nd one i received. I have 2 others that rotate freely with a finger spins several times this dont?? go figure & the second one received,2
"The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands.  This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.

"I often find the Starbucks K cups yield a moldy and rancid tasting brew. We have tried an assortment of Starbucks K cups flavors obtained at numerous outlets over the last year. It feels like this is a secondary (or even tertiary) market for Starbucks beans that don't make the grade. Or possibly Starbucks has production/storage/transportation issues when bringing the Starbucks K cups to market. It is a ding to the brand. Luckily, I am a devout Starbucks follower, so I will stick to their more proven bags of beans and grinds.",1

"This is a bold coffee that, unlike the strong coffee served at some major coffee shops, is not overburned to create that taste.  It is consistant and the K-cups make the who process definitely worth it.",5
"These crepes are soO delicous!  They're great with icecream,tea or just by themselves. I like the ones in the tin better.  These shown here are in paper box. The price are ok.  I've gotten them cheaper in store when I was in California.  I bought the 40 in a tin box for $10.  Anywho, they're are yummy delicous and great for gift basket.",5
"I have to write a review in order to get this off my 'Vine Voice' list.  I never recieved the free sample.  According to the tracking number, it ended up being delivered to the wrong town.",3
"It really isn't a POWDER.  It is more like a finely ground loose tea and won't blend in a smoothie because it is not ground finely enough.  Get Tradition brand if you want to make smoothies.  (It isn't organic, but at least it blends and it is also pure, meaning unsweetened.)  I am totally disappointed because this product wasn't as described.",1
"Sweet 'N Low has been a staple in our family ever since a member of the family controlled his diabetes with diet starting in 1964. While it's a great substitute for sugar, it was never a great product for baking. For baking, use Splenda. That, according to the bakers in the family. The only thing I've ever baked are chocolate chip cookies from Pillsbury, so don't take my word for it. We've used it pretty much for coffee and tea only over the years<br /><br />Some people will say that Sweet 'N Low has an aftertaste though I've never found that to be the case.<br /><br />Btw, six months ago, the 1500 packet package was $4 less then today, and two years ago it was $2 cheaper than that. Cheaper to buy the ""two-pack"" (3,000). Just keep it stored in a dry place. It doesn't go bad.<br /><br />I'm probably the typical non-diabetic user. It's psychological. With my cookie, I can have coffee with Sweet 'N Low instead of sugar. In fact, I might be able to have two cookies.",4
"This is a review of the SELLER Amazon chooses to deal with vs. a commentary on the product of Cafix. Cafix is a wonderful coffee substitute giving you that warm drink feeling in the morning without the after-effects of caffeine. It is the BEST coffee alternative made in my opinion.<br /><br />But DAB Nutrition (Direct Super Center) was TERRIBLE to deal with! They quoted a price for shipping on Amazon.com checkout of about $6 but then sent me an email that they had cancelled my order and wanted to charge me $26 to ship if I wanted to place the order again!!! When I called their customer service department, they refused to send the package via USPS which could ship for FAR less than $26!!!<br /><br />I am getting fed up with the suppliers Amazon chooses to deal with when it comes to shipping to Hawaii! Wrong shipping quotes and rude customer service- I was even told I lived in a 'foreign' zone once and that the supplier refused to ship to me! How can Amazon allow their suppliers to refuse to ship to a US address??<br /><br />I have chosen to buy my Cafix at  [...]<br /> where they offer reasonable shipping choices such as USPS parcel post. I can get 12 of these tins sent to me via  [...]<br /> for only $18.95!<br /><br />Forget DAB Nutrition (Direct Super Center) and their rude policies and get your fantastic coffee alternative from an online supplier who cares:  [...]<br /><br />signed, ""Frustrated in Maui""",2
"As described by other reviewers, I just wanted to add in response to an above revie, I have successfully used this with a yeast recipe. All you have to do is proof the yeast in the beginning with a teaspoon of real sugar to make it foam and then you can use xylitol as the sweetener in the recipe. This will add about 4 grams of total sugar to the recipe.",4
"I like this tea a lot.  I use it for iced tea as well, it adds a light mint tone to it.  I add a couple bags to the mix in the iced tea maker, it comes out great.",5
I was so excited to get these.  After WLS it's hard to find a savory snack with protien. Sooo I open the package and they are SUPER SALTY!! I like salt but these are runner up to a hamsters salt lick. Also a very strange texture.  If I were you I'd pass on these.  I gave it two stars for effort.  But I have a box of 15 left if anyone wants 'em.,2
"The variety in this package is excellent, I do not like a lot of bold/extra bold blends - so I would notorder it again.",3
"This tea smells and tastes like a fine loose leaf tobacco.  I just quit smoking so naturally I love this tea, it is a much healthier alternative to cigarettes.  It does have a very bold smokey flavor, if this taste is not 'your cup of tea' then this is not for you.",5
"These chips were disappointingly oily tasting and somewhat stale, even out of a freshly opened bag. I even opened a second bag to make sure it wasn't just a fluke. The chips are crisp enough, but taste like they were fried in old oil.",1
"My dog just loves these treats. They are good for her and apparently, taste pretty good. They are a product of Ecuador.",5
Thi is one bad product. I don't remember Certs tasting this bad. They taste really dry & bland. Had to buy Breath Savers. Will be glad when Amazon gets Ragold Spearmints back in stock.,1
"I got these for my daughters to try..... They ate a piece of them and, literally, spit them out at me. So, my husband and I tried a piece and it was the most awful taste and texture I have ever had.... no wonder my kids spit it at me!  Don't waste your money, there are lots of better dried fruit options out there!!!",1
"I had previously purchased a 2 pound bag of this brand of medium roast and thought it was too weak.  But this dark roast is also disappointing and in general this ""Community Coffee""  is just not very good coffee and is really not that great a bargain.",1
water & squash - out of all the products this is the BEST in comparison to even the same brand!,5
"Well first, my dog loves these.  I made the mistake of giving one to him at night before bed, and now he flat out demands these before bed or he pouts all night. Why?  Well, it's basically a healthy chicken jerky.  The ingredients are good, and so is the quality!  I am very sensitive as to what is in pet foods I buy, and this is a great treat!<br /><br />And I do have a comment about the person who mentioned that they are made in China. My response is so what?  I actually think it is a good thing!  We treat chickens (as mean as they are) so poorly here, and their waste pollutes our rivers and streams.  Land is a whole lot cheaper and easier to come by in China, and they don't tend to pack them as densely as they do here.  So thanks to China we have a great product with a much cheaper price point then we would normally have to pay for.  We are one world people, and if another country can make a quality product with a lighter impact on the environment then we can, I am happy to share whatever the profits are with them.  Sure they made many mistakes industrializing, and I am sure they will make more... just as we will.  However, they are very sensitive to maintaining quality at a good price point, and I have more faith in chicken coming from China then I do from the US... sad to say but true.<br /><br />So back to the review.  While the quality and look of the product is great looking, the smell indicates that the flavors are probably stronger then just regular chicken (think of beef jerky).  If your dog has a very sensitive tummy I would buy a small pack first and make certain that it digests easily.  As for my dog, a Golden Retriever, he would likely gobble the whole bag if he could, and not think twice about doing it again the next day.",5
"I purchased the Walkers Royal Toffees, because I had sampled some at a shoe store in Seattle. They were soft, melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  What I got when I ordered the 5.5 pound bag from Amazon were hard as a rock,  pull-your-teeth-out chewy.  The flavor was still great, but they obviously were either over cooked or old.  If anyone knows where to get the soft Walkers Toffees that don't stick to your teeth, let me know.  I love ordering from Amazon.  It's quick, easy, and convenient.  Occassionally I don't get exactly what I want, but returning products is pretty painless. I did not return the toffees as everyone else loved them tough and chewy.",2
"I haven't tried the spice honestly, because when I opened up the box, both jars were opened a little and leaking out in the box. Doesn't this stuff have a better seal? I don't even know if it's just a bad container or they don't normally have seals, but I'm uncomfortable using food products that don't come sealed.",1
"I am not a coffee snob, and not very up on the various types of coffee's out there, but I certainly know when something tastes like burnt crap! I recently got a breville coffee maker that came with an assortment of cups. Most of the coffee that came with it were OK, but this Italian Roast stuff was horrible! I took one sip and dumped it. I'm sure there are people who like this taste, but not me. personal preference I guess. If I could give a 0 I would.",1
"I grew up having a snack right before bed. This is fine for growing kids or active teens, but now that I am older, it's not so great. Eating right before bed isn't the best idea if you are watching your weight.<br /><br />I enjoy anything that I can chase down with a glass of milk. A cool glass of milk just seems to go with the whole idea of a bedtime snack. Often I have grape jelly toast or a bowl of sugary cereal.<br /><br />Hmmm... no wonder I'm not losing any weight.<br /><br />These crisps are a much better option - two bars for 100 calories. I can drink a tiny glass of skim milk with them as well and feel perfectly satisfied. These fruit crisps are a nice alternative to other sweet bedtime snacks.<br /><br />This product is a wonderful option for those of us who are watching their weight AND like a treat before bed.",5
"I have been buying the verona for a year to drink at work.  I like the dark kick, and cut it with a bit of cream.  Now that they are going out of production has any one tried the Cafe Noir or the Master Lorenzo espresso (from the T*** direct website? I am buying 6 bags of the verona (just in case Amazon runs out) but then what do I do?",4
"Although I would have given these a five star review, I have to take into my wife's account too. She liked them, but seemed to recognize that they were a substitute for normal pancakes.",4
"Wilton has amazing products.  The color of this yellow is perfect for making ""troops"" support ribbons.  They melt well, a little on the thicker side, but still work just fine.",4
"Amazon.com is an amazing superstore to have in one's home. I bake bread and know the value of gluten enriched flour. Bread flour makes the bread chewy, yet soft, tasty and palatable. The above product reviews assured me and a week later UPS delivered. I transferred the flour into Ziploc bags and froze to be safe. Am enjoying the bread. Amazing!",5
"I've been watching a lot of British TV on Netflix lately.  Show after show mentions Marmite lovingly.  I had to know what all the talk was about.  It's possible that the talk is because the British all joke about how bad it tastes.  They put this stuff on their toast so, I was expecting jelly or ""marm""alade.  Hokey smokes some cultural sensibilities are different!  We like you, Britain; glad the Queen has 60 years under her belt and everything.  We're glad Marmite is working out well for you but, Americans apparently left for a reason.",1
"My tiny, 10lb picky eater - who has a hard time chewing most kibble - absolutely loved this kibble, which normally she refuses to eat without being mixed with a little wet food or freeze dried raw meat (DELICIOUS, they say)!  The amount of red meat DID, however, make them a bit constipated, but between this and the fish recipe of EVO, my dogs have actually toned up a bit, on the same amount of food and same exercise regimen.",5
"After reading all the reviews I was really looking forward to getting these.  The arrived and I excitedly opened a can.  The texture was soft and the fish fell apart at the slightest touch. I could barely pick it up with a fork as it broke into a million little mushy pieces every time I touched it.  I thought it must be a fluke- an odd can that was abnormal.  Every can I have opened is the same.  The flavor is fine but the texture is totally off-putting.  I'll not buy any more.<br /><br />B. G. Huff<br />Philo, IL",2
"My husband and I have eaten McCann's steel cut oatmeal for years but with the original long cooking kind, we had to plan ahead to have it. This quick & easy variety makes it easy to have this oatmeal in just a few minutes. We love the chewey texture of McCann's. This oatmeal can be used any way the other oatmeals can. Try in oatmeal & raisin cookies, the best ever!",5
"I got one of these as a father's day gift a couple of years ago.<br />It gave me great light and worked fine for about 15 minutes, then I'd come back to the grill<br />and it would be off, and wouldn't turn back on.<br />I changed batteries and it continued to do the same thing.<br />I figured out that it was shutting off due to the heat from<br />the hood.  I ended up giving it to the Goodwill. Pehaps someone could use it as a reading<br />lamp atop their bed board.",2
"In fairness, the description does say for Pets and Small animals. I was hoping that my very large, stubborn Cane Corso Mastiff would feel the buzz and back off from running away. He just plowed through the fence like he was a bulldozer and didn't even blink or look back. But then again, when we rescued him from the pound he had a 9"" long ratchet wrench in his gut that he ate. I guess he is impervious to physical pain. But, he will back off when I wave the kids butterfly net in his face.<br /><br />I'll try to salvage the fence poles and use it around the garden to keep the feral cats from digging. But it just seems like a lot of work because the feet have to be grounded and the body touching the wire. I'm sure the squirrels will still be getting my peaches.",3
"I ordered Seattle's Best Ground Blend Coffee, 12-Ounce (Pack of 2) and have brewed several pots with several changes in the amount of coffee used. I have yet to get a 'good' pot out of this. To be fair, what I expected from this was good flavor and strength. The coffee is weak, in my opinion. I also feel it lacks appealing flavor or flavor at all in some cases. I feel the taste is equal to making coffee from a bargain brand, which this is not. I would not re-order or recommend this coffee. Note that I love, however, the decaf version of this, which is very good- tasty and robust.",1
"The cream cheese was a little hard to taste in this cookie that is why I gave it a four star rather than a five star. Overall, this is a good cookie, not too large and not too small with just the right amount of chocolate. I would buy again.",4
"I grew up in Laguna Beach (and now live in Vermont) and LOVE these chips.  My Dad is coming from So. Cal to visit, so I called him and said, ""There is one thing you could bring me....Have A Chips!""  He groaned because he knew they would be crushed and said ""Sorry.""  I told him I didn't care if they were crumbs, but he did!  20 minutes ago the UPS truck pulled up and out came a case of Have A Chips!!!!  My neighbors are wondering why I am so excited over chips....I am keeping them a secret!",5

"I notice from the labels that the net weight of this is actually lower than the net weight for their organic white tea. This implies somewhat less tea proper per bag, since the mint is also part of the weight. If drinking white tea for the health benefits, this may be important. It would be nice if it was easy to determine the exact amount of tea being bought.",4
"I love this rice!  It truly is ""tender and delicious"" as stated on the package.  Keep in mind that even though it is a product of California, this is a Japanese-style brown rice, thus more polished than American-style brown rice.<br /><br />Unfortunately, a few months after posting this review I have had some  bad batches of this rice, regardless of the place of purchase (I tried a nearby Japanese food store as well as a mail-order Korean store).  I also had that experience when buying it already cooked (as part of the bento lunches at a nearby Japanese cafe). It is as if the rice is on its way to being rancid.  If anyone knows what the problem is and how to recognize it before I buy a pack, please let me know because when it is good, it is outstanding.",3
"Love Wellness canned food.  I've done a lot of pet food research, and I've come down to Wellness canned (grain free non-Core varieties only) being the best. It's grade A food, that is actually MADE IN THE USA!!!  You'd be surprised how hard this is to find (e.g. Weruva is made in Thailand).  I only wish they didn't use BPA in their cans.  My cats loved the turkey flavor for a very long time.  However, as with all foods, they got sick of it eventually.  So now I rotate between Turkey & Salmon, Chicken & Herring, and Chicken and Beef.",4
"i have just brought one small package of Canidea from my oversea agent 2weeks ago, before my puppy only tried a french brand. First i was just mixed them together and seems ok, but then the old finished there is something weird happened to her, she started eating the stools??!! >:( yes and also vomited white yellowish foam and coughing after totally swished into this brand, even sent her to vet checking blood, taking pills and medical treat which i was thinking she might catch cold. anyway only feel lucky is vet cost much cheaper here...<br />then now she refuse to eat it or only a little if really hungry. most of time she'd rather biting a bone, glad saw the comments here, i will change it to other brand asap :)",1
"This dog food is awesome.  It smells so good and it could easily be consumed by humans! Speaking of... funny story... I told my husband to smell the prepared dog food I had made and he thought it smelled wonderful.  SO GOOD that he took a big spoonful of it and ate it!  Then I told him it was dog food...  :-  My dogs LOVE this stuff, but a little goes a LONG way. I didn't want my dogs to get a stomach ache  when we first switched so I put a few spoonfuls in with their regular dog food.  That seemed to work well and prolongs the last of both.  The shipping was fast and the service was courteous.  Would order from again.",5
Caper berries are delicious.  I first had them in a tasty salad at the Galaxy Grill in Manhattan.  This particular brand of caper berries is okay but there is too much of a frequency of biting into a berry that is too mature so you wind up with a mouth of seeds which is not pleasant.,3
"These are not what I was expecting. They don't taste like any unsulfered apricots I've ever eaten before. Their texture is strange, too. They're soft and squishy, and not very chewey, which is what I'm used to.  Most importantly, they smell and taste awful.  Amazon doesn't accept returns on Grocery items, so it's money down the drain for me.",1
"The Healthy 'n Fit egg protein is a very good product. It's almost all protein, the taste is good, you can cook with it (my favorites are oatmeal and Russian-style cottage cheese pancakes). And the price *used* to be great, even cheaper per ounce than the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86"">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>. However, since I bought my first tub earlier this year, the price jumped significantly to more than the Optimum Nutrition chocolate-flavored egg protein, so I bought a 2-lb. tub of that. I found that while the ON protein has a little fat and more carbs in it, it was much easier to mix into liquids with fewer or no clumps, unlike the Healthy 'n Fit product. I also like the taste just fine. So I found that I enjoy my shakes with the ON more, and it's faster and easier to mix my oatmeal in the morning with the ON.<br /><br />Please don't get me wrong -- this is a great product. But I just don't think it warrants a higher price than the Optimum Nutrition protein.<br /><br />So, to recap, as compared to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86"">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>:<br />Pros:<br />Lower in carbs<br />Lower in fat<br /><br />Cons:<br />More expensive<br />Clumpier/harder to mix",4
"I purchased these February 4th, and they shipped 2 Day Air with my Amazon Prime.  However as will the other reviews, they only have a 5 month shelf life.  The box I received expires in 18 days.  Luckily Amazon issued a refund for the product.<br /><br />Had the product had more time left on the shelf life it would have been an excellent buy.  However the 18 day limit but a real ding in my plan to take them to work to use for my sandwiches at lunch",3
"Short and sweet.....The product itself is top notch and my two GSD's love it. However, the last shipment looked like it was packaged by a three year old and thus it arrived via UPS with a can lid popped open spilling its contents over the other dented cans. Another case arrived seperately which was properly packaged using air pillows and was fine. Don't get sloppy Amazon. It will cost you customers.",3
"this company uses boxes that leads you to believe you are getting a pound of pasta like other companies but you only get 13 some ounces. I noticed when opening up their boxes how little pasta is inside. I bought a whole bunch of this stuff, different styles that were all in standard size packaging that most companies provide a lb of pasta to realize they mislead you into thinking you are getting a lb.<br />The stuff is not cheap to begin with. I truly wonder with a company that is misleading if their claims of 5 digestable grams of carbs is true. They can say whatever they want as this stuff is not FDA regulated.",1
"I must say that I bought this for two reasons. One, because the price was right and second, because it had CHOCOLATE. I actually liked this one better than others except it is no Cafe Mocha. What can I say, I'm going to search now for a Cafe Mocha here on Amazon. If the price is right i'll buy it.",4
"These sugar coated fennel seeds are much more tasty than the ones I originally became enamored with from nutsonline.com.  These seeds are very tiny and the coating is delicate so a very easy and tasty mouth feel.  They are like ""Good and Plenty"" candies only all grown up.  I would highly recommend.<br /><br />Update:  I think the company might have gotten some other kind of seeds mixed in.  I keep thinking I taste possibly cumin seeds, possibly others.  For sure, not all of the seeds are fennel.  It spoils the taste a bit, but still a good after dinner snack.",4

"Well, I like it.  Everyone is different.  I'm an energy freak and have tried MANY, so when I say I like it, it means the energy it gives is good enough no jitters and the taste is so much better than others i've tried.  My boyfriend tried it and the first thing he did was spit it right back out..lol...like I said everyone is different.",3
"I really love this product.  The commercial came on TV and I found it at the local store.  THEN I went to the store to buy it and it disappeared.  I went to every store in town to find it, could not find it anywhere. Had to go to the internet to find it, and Amazon is the only one that had it.  I am glad you have it.  THANKS AMAZON!!!",5
"Great salt.  I wondered how you got sea salt in the Himalayas, but then I saw a TV program about how the Himalayas used to be at the bottom of an ocean.  It even showed the hosts finding a sea creature fossil in the Himalayas.  So, anyway, this is really sea salt.",5
"I had tried these before from the local Whole Foods and was excited to get them in bulk for a better price and with more flavor selections. Out of all the freeze dried fruit companies, I like Funky Monkey the best (and Trader Joe's brand). They are crunchy, flavorful, and a good portion size for a small snack. I keep them in my desk at work for when I don't have time to shop for fresh fruit, and want something that fills the craving for a crunchy snack. They fit easily on the weight watchers plan. The pineapple and mango are my favorite for straight up and the bananas I like best mixed with oatmeal or yogurt. Very happy with this purchase!",5
"I have 5 cats on this food as well as the seafood. This is their favorite, but they will eat the seafood as well. My old gentleman, 16 this year, loves it, and is doing very well on it. Quality ingredients for a fair price. I do agree with the one reviewer who said the cans were all dented and hard to open. Mine have been the same with every shipment. Don't know if that's why the price is so good or not.",5
"I expected the flavor to be more like that of ""brewed"" green tea. It really does taste like dried green tea leaves simply dissolved in water. Although I'm sure this is probably a good way to get a concentrated amount of antioxidants, I wouldn't order this again.",2
My mother had terminal cancer and lost some appetite. These burgers were good to her. My brother who was staying with her thought so too. They were convenient as well. I also liked them.,5
"Smells delicious and tastes delicious.  I love this particular flavor but, for me, it is definitely a flavor that I want only one cup of--no second helpings of this one as it is a bit sweet and rich.  It is definitely a treat.",4
"I am careful about the food that I select for my cats because I want them to be healthy.  Unlike dogs, cats are strict carnivores, so any fillers in cat food are unnecessary and potentially harmful.  Also, cats have a very short digestive tract, so though fiber is good for humans, it is not important for cats.  Finding a cat food that meets these stipulations takes quite a bit of research.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine makes the mark.  The first three ingredients in each of the formulations in these variety packs are fish broth, and two different fish meats.  There is no trace of any grain fillers, and of course no wheat gluten, which was the source of the melanine tainting that has now killed and sickened humans as well as pets.<br /><br />The guaranteed analysis on the cat foods is crude protein - 13% min, crude fat - 1.5% min, crude fiber - 1% max, moisture - 85% max, ash - 3% max, and taurine 0.1% min.<br /><br />My cats of course love it.  They even seem to take a little time to savor the meal, and the food has caused zero digestive difficulties.<br /><br />The consistency is similar to a can of BumbleBee tuna, with fish chunks in a broth.  In fact, I could probably use this cat food to make a tuna fish salad, and no human would be the wiser (except for the accusatory and incriminating looks of the cats.)<br /><br />The recommended daily ration for this cat food for an adult cat is 1-2 cans per 2 1/2 pounds of body weight, which is a bit higher than my other canned cat food.<br /><br />Overall, this is the finest cat food that I've come across so far.  I'll probably use it as a supplement to brand that I feed as a mainstay.",5
"My son is allergic to corn so no corn syrup. It is surprisingly difficult to find candy made with sugar! I bought these to decorate our Christmas tree so that he could enjoy them. We all loved them. There is something more pure about the taste. I had another regular corn syrup candy cane and it had a funny after taste to me.  The only negative comment I heard from my kids was that the color wasn't as vibrant as ""regular"" candy canes. Didn't stop them from eating the 6 boxes we had on the tree! Highly recommend!",5
"At first I thought I'd like the coconut juice with lime as something different and refreshing, but it grew old for me.  I much prefer the regular flavored coconut juice.  Now, as for Amy & Brian's products, I do like them.  Great flavor.  I'm just not a huge fan of the juice with lime.",3
"These gummies are far less chewy than any other gummy I've ever had and they were outright sugary.  I don't know if I happened on a bad batch, or if Haribo's Tropi-Frutti gummies are meant to be so sugary and less chewy, and I'm not talking sugary as a person who prefers less sugar, I'm talking sugary as in the amount of sugar completely over powers the fruit flavor.  I won't be buying these again, especially since Haribo makes so many other wonderful gummies.",2
"I love the product so far - I think it's a great idea, saves money and saves me from carrying heavy bottles up 3 flights of stairs... but the syrup tastes ""off"". I would compare the regular flavors to off-brand, diet soda, and I haven't tried the diet flavors yet because I can't imagine that they would taste any better. I can tell that they use Splenda (or something other than real sugar) because the ""sweet"" taste that's found in most sodas is just not there.<br /><br />All of that aside, most of the flavors DO taste similar their counterparts (Fountain Mist = Mountain Dew, Lemon Lime = Sprite, etc.) I would recommend getting the Variety Pack to find which things you like before you buy a bottle that makes 12 liters.",3
"I bought this cereal thinking I was buying an amazing product for my child...gotta try and be that supermom ya know :). I took it into her pediatrition to make sure that there was nothing too crazy in this cereal and she said basically it is just playing up all of the things that these cereals normally have in them. She said it may have a little bit different of percentages when comparing it to say a Gerber cereal but its practically the same thing. Now I personally love that this is organic and the Happy Bellies brand is one that I really like for my daughter. She doesnt however seem to like the taste of this cereal unless mixed with applesauce and/or added to a large quantity of formula or breastmilk. Overall I think this product is average for an organic cereal, however the price point is reasonable enough. I would say you dont need to go out of your way to purchase this but if your in the market for a higher end brand of cereal for your little one, you could give this a try.",3

"This is, by far, our favorite coffee.  I haven't had any issues with it tasting stale, but it is mild roast with a sweet almond flavor to it.  It's incredible first thing in the morning, I love how my kitchen smells after brewing it.",5
"I am a coffee aficionado, and as time has gone on, I find I prefer a stronger taste in my coffee.<br />I have tasted every kind of coffee, but find I always go back to Starbucks. Pike Place Roast has<br />become my favorite. Sometimes I alternate between Sumatra and Pike Place, but Pike Place wins out<br />every time! It has a taste of cocoa, with roasted nuts in its flavor. It has a smooth finish with<br />soft acidity. This has become the roast I have, all the time. Satisfying with enough depth and<br />flavor to please.<br /><br />I have been tempted at times to buy a Keurig type coffee maker, but discovered that I would be paying<br />on average $50 a pound for the coffee found in those little Keurig cups. The price for a pound of<br />Pike Place Roast is $12.99.<br /><br />I found this recipe for making good coffee from Starbucks a few years ago, and this is the one I use<br />'til this day.<br /><br />Recipe for great coffee<br /> 1.Use cold, filtered water and a clean machine.<br /> 2.Grind beans just before brewing: *Course for coffee press<br />*Medium for automatic drip<br /><br />3.Measure 2 tbsp (10 g) ground coffee for every 6 fl oz (180 ml) water.<br /><br />To help preserve that fresh flavor, keep this bag sealed tight in the bag.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 02-11-12<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1605292885"">Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life without Losing Its Soul</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071477845"">The Starbucks Experience: 5 Principles for Turning Ordinary Into Extraordinary</a>",5
"Two small amount in each package to be worth the price.  Wanted to see if I liked Freeze dried fruits.  Taste was fine, but unhappy with contents.  Two expensive!",3
labeling says one serving has 11 grams of fat but less than one gram saturated. since most of the fat comes from coconut oil the saturated fat should be quite high like in comparable banana chip products. i called them and emailed them about this. they said they'd get back to me but never did. i  love their banana chips but the labeling is definitely incorrect about the saturated fat content.,3
"This was unspeakably bad.  Tasked like raw chemicals and I love cider enough to tolerate a minor bad taste.  Afraid to try the caramel that I also bought.  I guess the 1 carb should have been fair warning to avoid at all costs.<br /><br />Would have returned, but cannot.  Too nasty to even bring in to work and pawn off on unsuspecting co-workers for fear the clients might have some and keel over.",1
"I don't really have much confidence in any commercial pet food,  but the  ingredient list for Newmans's seems better than most.",3
It's not very tasty. Chewing this beef jerky is like chewing sand paper. Thick cut is the way to go.,2
"Really like this soup,but spoon by spoon-it gets hotter and hotter! Why in God's name did Bear Creek have to ruin this soup by putting way too much pepper in it? It's not necessary for them to add this amount of pepper to their mix-not eveybody likes this much pepper in their soup!If the consumer wants more pepper,they can add it themselves.You know the saying-you can always add it,but you can't take it out.SUCH a dissappointment...........",3
"I am extremely caffeine sensitive and this gum just doesn't do it for me.  I sometimes chew 3-4 pieces at a time (which is equal to two cups of coffee) and nothing.  I don't feel any sort of ""jolt"" at all.  I feel like I'm chewing regular old mint gum.  So much for help staying awake working the night shift!  Two stars for the flavor.",2
Nothing much to say.  Same as last time.  Too bad the price couldn't be cheaper.,4
"Product came quickly and was as described, but when I cooked it , it was noticeably different in taste and texture, did not hate, would eat if starving, but flavor and exture was ""off-putting"".",3
"I selected this company over the other even though the price was higher. I was hoping the pieces would be more consistent in size. It tuened out the container was filled with smaller crum like pieces, worse than the other company's. I will never buy anything from this company.",1
"I bought these bars as a quick meal replacement or snack, but my 4-year old son (an extremely picky eater) has enjoyed them for breakfast more than anything else I've offered!  He thinks they are candy bars and requests at least one daily.  The nutritional information on the package suggests that they are an even healthier, heartier choice than granola or cereal bars. Now, if he would just leave me a few...",4
"There's always room in the cabinet for yet another flavor of coffee to help get you going in the morning, and this one's great to help get into the holiday mood to boot.  Normally instant coffee isn't my thing, but the ""Pumpkin Spice Latte"" flavor is surprisingly good. It's definitely better with milk than water, and has a very rich and creamy feel.  As a change of pace from standard coffee with flavored creamer this is definitely recommended for anyone who likes pumpkin or nutmeg flavors.<br /><br />One pitfall to be aware of is that this type of instant coffee is prone to clumping badly, so be sure to add the milk to the coffee and not the other way around or you'll end up with big clumps floating around on the top.<br /><br />Obviously flavored instant coffee meant to imitate a latte isn't health food, but it's worth noting there is a decent amount of sugar in each serving, and weirdly even a fairly high amount of saturated fat.  I wouldn't recommend having a couple of cups of a day, but it's not terrible for you as an occasional treat to replace your standard morning cup of joe.",4
We really enjoyed this product -- containes no sugar (contains dates and such) and it's healthy while giving you the chocolate fix you need!,4
I just lost my dog of 14 years to a Dingo bone. She choked to death last night. I rushed her to a emergency vet clinic but it was too late. She was a Shih Tzu so beware if you have a small dog and you give them these. She ate Dingo bones as a treat all of her life and never had a problem. I have another dog and just threw out 4 bags of these. NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY THESE for my dog.,1
PRODUCT DOES NOT LOOK AS IT DOES NO AMAZON.COM WEBSITE.  WILL DISAPPOINT RECIPIENT. MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RETURN.  I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.,1
We will not be purchasing this product again. Items arrived broken as the boxes were packed into boxes much too large.  The quality was not up to par with most Pop Tarts.,2
"This is the first time I tried Matcha. It tastes different than regular green tea, kind of nori like. It isn't something I will drink every day. You use very little per cup so it will last a long long time.",5
"My son is 6 and he has celiac.  He loves sweets, however when he took a bite of this wafers he was done with it.  He said that it just was not good.  I tasted it and had to agree with him.  The only thing I could taste was the extreme sweetness and the fat sticking to the roof of my mouth.",1
I bought this mustard seed to add to my home made summer sausage thinking that it would add some flavor to it but it didn't. this mustard seed has no flavor at all not sure if I need to do something to it before I add it to the sausage or not. I never used mustard seed before so if someone could tell me what I need to do to get some flavor from these seeds I'd be happy.,3
"I have used this brand for years and love the red beans and rice packet. But last night we were cooking up the yellow rice for the first time and my husband discovered MSG as one of the ingredients!!!!!!!! I was shocked! Lesson learned... I will read all of the packets ingredients before buying in the future. It will be sad if we can't enjoy these easy and delightful side dishes in the future. Though they list ingredients on this site, notice the disclaimer below. I would rather not support a business that uses these tactics. You decide for yourself.",2
"I've only eaten the KIND bar once, and it was definitely not this flavor but I didn't realize it until I opened it up and tasted it.  I love mango. I love macadamia. But in this bar, together, they are not great.  It's not bad... just not my cup of tea. The mango is a little too artificial and I don't get the macadamia crunch so I would say try another flavor.",2
"Even though this is 95% chicken, it looks like cat food (ground up texture) and smells like stinky canned chicken.  It's a very strong smell!  My dogs go NUTS for this, though (1 Labrador and 2 Boston Terriers).  I just add a couple spoonfuls as a topper to their dry food, so one can lasts awhile.  I probably will try something less smelly next time but I like the quality of the ingredients and like the Wellness brand.",4
"My first impression is that the scent is nice. It's a clean soapy scent but not as strong as Irish Spring or some of the other men's body washes out there.<br /><br />The problem is that it is way too gritty/grainy.  For a body wash whose description focuses on moisture and ""skin comfort"" and is also meant for use on your face, I was a little surprised that it was so abrasive.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good exfoliant it might be a good choice but I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is looking for a moisturizing facial wash that promotes skin comfort.  I think the product description/marketing is all wrong.  Had I been looking for a super clarifying exfoliant I think I would have been pleased.",3
My dog LOVES this toy (Weimaraner/Rottweiler mix). She has not chewed it up as she does with so many of her toys. The only disadvantage is that it is LOUD. I have hardwood floors and she sounds like a one-woman wrecking crew!,4
"I have a 16lb Dachsund and we have a very hard time finding toys that she is interested in. We adopted her, and her home before us was as a breeder at a puppy mill where they kept her in a crate her whole life. So long story short, she has no idea what to do with toys and really, I'm out of ideas. She gets interested at first, but has a really hard time manuevering the bottle to get the treats out (she has had back surgery to repair paralysis in her hind end from ruptured discs so is not super agile). Also I think my little wiener has a little trouble figuring it out and I'm not sure how else to show her. I do like to toy and it has withstood her frustrations but I think I need more help with it. Some helpful hints or instructions would be greatly appreciated.",3
"I love this tea.  Just don't drink it too close to bedtime, because it can keep you awake.  It is really refreshing.  I have only used as my sun tead for ice tea.",4
"Unlike most cheap store brands, the first ingredient in this stuff is not corn, its actually chicken - I've always been told cat food with corn as their first main ingredient isn't healthy in the long run. Kitty tend to eat other food too quickly and pukes it up frequently, but this stuff takes much longer for him to chew, and makes him eat slower. Litter box also doesn't smell nearly as horrible as with a lot of other foods I've tried.",5
"Black Tiger K cups are just the right strength, robust and earthy. They deliver the burst of coffee that I need in the morning.",4
"This is great stivia. It has nothing added to to (like other sugars!) and tastes very sweet without the bitter after taste. It it great added into hot beverages, my only complaint is it does not really dissolve in cold beverages without prolonged stiring!",4
"Wow - hard to find except on Amazon. Wonderful liquorice flavor, but awfully strong....stronger than I remember.  Too bad they can't tone them down just a notch.",4
"I wanted to note that these are the best-tasting, raw lemon cookies I have ever tried. I will not use banal frases such as ""they are good for you"" or anything like that. I will just mention that they leave me satisfied and with a joyful feeling inside. I can feel that these raw cookis are made with love, and I will definitely purchase them again.",5
"This is an excellent bargain.  the coffee tastes good.<br />the easy open containers are very nice, and they are plastic so there is not breakage.",4
"I recently ran low on Castor & Pollux Organix Adult Less Active Canine Formula Dry Dog Food and it was unavailable with Prime shipping at the time, so I ordered this brand.  I've been mixing the two together to increase my dog's acceptance, but she now has not eaten for three days straight.  I suppose that is an alternate strategy for weight reduction, but neither of us is happy, and the food was really expensive.  My dog does not recommend this dog food. She preferred the Organix.",1
"I have been making okonomiyaki quite often lately, but I have always topped it with American mayo, like Hellman's or Duke's.  I finally bought some Kewpie today because I kept hearing about how it's so much better for okonomiyaki.  I must say that I'm not really a fan.  It just tastes like Miracle Whip (I've always hated it) with MSG.  I'll be sticking with the American stuff after this is gone.",3
"My husband has gluten sensitivity, so we've tried several gluten-free pastas.  This one does not hold together, even with the minimum cook time, and it turns into smaller bits, making my pot of spaghetti runny and not noodly enough.  I won't buy it again.",2
"I HAVE BOUGHT SIX PLANTS FROM HIRTS GARDENS. ONE WAS INFESTED WITH MEALY BUGS & THRIPS, 2 WERE SENT BENT ,BROKEN DUE TO NOT PACKING THE PLANT CORRECTLY, MOST OF THEM HAD BROWN DRY LEAVES AND EVEN LEAF SPOTS. IVE POSTED THIS REVIEW BEFORE AND I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM HIRTS STATING PLEASE REMOVE MY REVIEW CAUSE IT HURTS THERE BUSINESS, I WASNT EVEN OFFERED AN APOLOGY ON ANY OF THE ISSUES. THEN I NOTICE THAT HIRTS SOME HOW HAS DELETED ALL OF THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS ON SOME PLANTS THAT I POSTED BUT HAVE NOT DELETED THE POSITIVE COMMENTS ON THE OTHER PLANTS. SO THIS IS WHY THEY HAVE SO MANY FIVE STARS BECAUSE THEY ARE TAKING OUT THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS WE AS CUSTOMERS POST. (VERY DISHONEST OF HIRTS GARDEN)",1
"I was delighted to have the opportunity to review this peanut butter, because I happen to be a bit of a PB addict. I consume a lot of it. Planter's has entered this market with a bang, in my opinion. This is some of the best-tasting PB I have ever had. It has the peanut taste without the bitterness and without the sweetness that some other PBs include. It does not have an overwhelming aftertaste, which I think is a good thing. The texture is extra-creamy, which makes it very spreadable (and spoonable) and easily swallowed. You don't feel like you need to wash it down. This is yummy stuff!<br /><br />I did a label comparison with the PB I have been buying for years, which is a low-fat creamy style. Interestingly, Planters has fewer calories, fewer carbs, and more dietary fiber - more fat, of course, but not a huge amount.<br /><br />Guess what - I have a new peanut butter. Nice job, Planter's!",5
"This product is more of a crumbly cookie.  My beagle ate it for a few days and then refused them.  I thought that his digestive system was a bit disrupted by this product, as well.  Of course, I cannot say for sure that these treats were the cause of his upset...perhaps my beagle can.  Anyhow, I will not be repeating this order.",2
These bags have been working really well for my family. I have had no problems with ripping-- though I am using this for kitchen trash. I would definitely not use these bags for any kind of yard debris (think sticks) or remodeling/construction projects (think lumber and nails). However for my kitchen these have worked like a charm. I just wish these were a tad bit cheaper.,4
"I guess I am in the minority, but this hash product tastes like cheap fatty meat and stale potatoes.  It splutters out so much grease while browning that you need to be prepared for a very stinky house and a stove that needs A LOT of 409 to get clean.  Maybe this is a nostalgia food I missed the boat on; I bought a can to try to see if our family wanted to stock some in our emergency food box since I have never had canned hash before.  This roast beef flavor has less salt than all others which is why I bought it, I cannot imagine how salty those must taste. If you like canned hash, listen to the 5 star reviews; if you never had it before, buy one can at the store to try before investing money and pantry space -- I am so glad I did!",1
I was disappointed with this tea.  The taste was no better than Liptons Yellow Label Tea.  I expected more from a Stash loose tea since I have had good expereience with some of their tea bags.,2
"Disappointed, does not fit the brew system.  The lid does not fully close.  Product does brew coffee, but am afraid it will eventually harm the machine.",2
The peas are way too salty to eat I talked to the owner she did't care about the condition of the peas.,2
Didn't care for the taste. Not what I expected.  I had an aunt who grew up in maui who used to make sweet bread all the time. I expected something closer to Hawaiian sweet I buy at publix.,2
"I bought the Kidney Bean Curry and a few other of the Kitchens of India ready to eat packages when Amazon had them for the deal of the day. I believe they winded up coming out to about $1.50 per 10oz package, which isn't to shabby considering regular price they are about $3-3.50 each regular price.<br /><br />This was the first flavor I decided to taste.<br /><br />Upon opening the package and placing it into a bowl I could see a ton of oil floating on the top. I don't understand why most food makers / chef's feel the need to add so much oil to their dishes, but it was a bit offsetting to look at.<br /><br />I pressed out as much as I could from the package, but there did not seem to be a lot. Be careful too when opening because it comes sliding out pretty quickly and you can end up with a big mess!<br /><br />I was thinking I would not be able to eat it all in one sitting before I opened the package, but after pouring it in the bowl I could clearly see it wasn't going to be enough at all to fill me up.<br /><br />That being said, you definitely are going to want to eat this with something else such as naan or rice. I wouldn't expect to open a package, eat it alone, and fill you up.<br /><br />Now onto the taste...<br /><br />I can definitely taste the cumin. Seems a bit strong in the dish, but it wasn't too overpowering. Also, I like my food spicy and normally add more spice to already spicy food. But with this one I didn't add any spices.<br /><br />I was not a strong spice at all but it was still spicy enough for me (on that particular day, lol).<br /><br />Overall, I liked the taste of the ready to eat Kidney Bean Curry. I dont think I would pay full price for them based of the portion size being seemingly small, but if they are on sale I would probably get more later on down the road.<br /><br />I can not wait to taste the others as well, and although it definitely does not replace the great taste of going to an authentic Indian restaurant, the price you will pay for these compared to the restaurant is pretty substantial savings if you ask me!",4
"It tastes good. But the package are not like what I've bought, and I can't find the quality guarantee period anywhere.",4
"I thought this might be a good alternative to buying fresh coconuts every week and having to hack into them to get the juice out. Unfortunately, while fresh coconut juice tastes great, this canned stuff has kind of a nasty flavor in it.<br /><br />I will say that it's a better alternative than the many sweetened, watered down cans of coconut juice, but that's the only thing it has going for it.<br /><br />I may try one other brand to see if I can find one that tastes more like fresh coconut juice, but otherwise I'm sticking to the real thing.",2
"FANTASTIC!!! These little chips are sweet and melt in your mouth.  A great choice for cooking projects that require chocolate that melts easily.  The palm gives it SUCH a mellow flavor :)<br /><br />It is so hard to make exciting treats for kids on a GFCF diet... until you really get going on it, that is!  My kids have been thriving on a GFCF diet for 3 years now.  Every year they tolerate sugar a little better, so we have been experimenting with different recipes involving sweets.  Last night we used these with our whirly gig kettle corn popcorm maker (that we LOVE) and we made white chocolate/cinnamon/raisin/kettle corn, it was sweet and salty and delicious.<br /><br />I can't wait to make homeade white chocolate lollipops!  And experiment with a recipe on the (also gfcf) rice chex box!<br /><br />If you can't tolerate dairy, these chips are definitely worth a try.",5
These wafers taste incredible under normal circumstances but the six tins are a crumbled mess of smashed chocolate sticks. They should have written 'fragile' on the box. It's literally a pile of chocolate goo and crumbs. I will not order again...,1
"I love coffee and drink about 6 cups a day. Hazelnut is one of my favorite flavors, but since I get Hazelnut flavored coffee so often, I wanted something a little different. I was really happy I did. This has a great taste, with a blend of hazelnut and coffee cake taste. Also, no bitter after-taste.",5
"Even though it says it's a medium roast, it's more mild and weak flavored. Would definitely have to use more pods to get better flavor. My son also tried it and used 2 pods for a 16 oz to go cup. He agreed it was weak but also commented that it had an odd flavor note to it.",3
"Looking forward to the replacement shipment from Amazon.  Every single can was dented.  The 8 cans were shrinkwrapped, and then packaged in a larger box with really big air packs (like giant bubbles from bubble wrap) around them.  Obviously, when they arrived, there was just some plastic...nothing to stop the cans from jumbling around in the box.  How someone would think that an air pack could cushion a 10+ pound set of cans without popping is beyond me.  Again, Amazon is sending replacements...hoping these aren't all dented :)",2
Open air cups - not a good idea. Better off with real K cups.  Open air cups - not a good idea. Better off with real K cups.,1
"As other reviewers have mentioned, this looks like a bottle of roll-on deodorant. It's not quite what I was expecting. You have to squeeze it a little to get the liquid to flow, and then the dog can lick at the roller ball, similarly to how a hamster would drink from its water bottle. It works well enough, and my dog likes the taste okay. It seems to bother her that she can't chew on it, and it bothers me that I can't just hand it to her and let her go to town on it. Yes, it's convenient and non-messy to carry around. For my dog, the low-calorie aspect isn't necessarily a good thing. For example, when I take her on a hike, she runs around like crazy, so I actually want her to get some calories from her treats. The other times I give her treats, I'm usually giving her something chewy that will help remove dental plaque. So overall, this isn't a great option for my particular dog. If your dog has a weight problem and you like to give it treats, this is probably a good alternative for you. This isn't something that I'll purchase again myself.",3
"Do Not Buy this unless you love the wonderful flavor and aroma of instant coffee crystals. It is instant coffee, not real ground coffee beans.",1
