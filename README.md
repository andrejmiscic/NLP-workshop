# Introduction to state of the art NLP (GPT and BERT)
This are the materials for the second iteration of the [DS-ULFRI](https://datascience.fri.uni-lj.si/) NLP workshop. Subscribe to our newsletter, so you don't miss future workshops.

*Authors:* Andrej Miščič, Luka Vranješ

### Agenda:
- **theoretical introduction** (~45 min) ([slides](https://github.com/andrejmiscic/NLP-workshop/blob/master/Modern_NLP_through_large_pretrained_language_models.pdf))
    - motivation for Transformers
    - Transformer architecture
    - language representation with GPT and BERT
- **practical part** (live coding session):
    - [Named entity recognition with BERT](https://github.com/andrejmiscic/NLP-workshop/blob/master/notebooks/NamedEntityRecognition.ipynb)
    - [Sentiment analysis with BERT](https://github.com/andrejmiscic/NLP-workshop/blob/master/notebooks/SentimentAnalysis.ipynb)
    - [Text generation with GPT-2](https://github.com/andrejmiscic/NLP-workshop/blob/master/notebooks/TextGeneration.ipynb)

To view prepared notebooks, open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), go to `File -> Open notebook -> Github` and search for username *andrejmiscic*. From the list of notebooks you will be able to select the aforementioned ones.
- **hands-on part**: under `Data` you will find a description of all available tasks and datasets. Choose whichever one you like the most and modify the accompanying notebook to train the model on your dataset.

## First iteration of the workshop:
###  Modern NLP through large pretrained language models
This are the materials for [DS-ULFRI](https://datascience.fri.uni-lj.si/) workshop. Subscribe to our newsletter, so you don't miss future workshops.

Authors: prof. dr. Marko Robnik Šikonja, Luka Vranješ, Andrej Miščič

#### Theoretical part:
Lecture with prof. dr. Marko Robnik Šikonja. [Slides](https://github.com/andrejmiscic/NLP-workshop/blob/master/Modern_NLP_through_large_pretrained_language_models.pdf).

#### Practical part:
Downstream tasks live coding session. To view prepared notebooks, open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), go to `File -> Open notebook -> Github` and search for username *andrejmiscic*.
Notebooks:
- [Named entity recognition with BERT](https://github.com/andrejmiscic/NLP-workshop/blob/master/notebooks/NamedEntityRecognition.ipynb)
